Despite beating estimates on both revenue and earnings, the tech giant fell short on Intelligent Cloud revenue expectations. Piper Sandler equity research analyst for cloud software and analytics Brent Bracelin joins Market Domination to discuss whether AI expectations for tech companies are too lofty.\\nBracelin identifies the Azure business as \\\"the primary growth engine\\\" for Microsoft. While the company increased spending on AI and cloud infrastructure during the quarter, the report showed slowing growth in the Azure business, which Bracelin notes is \\\"a little bit of a confusing thing for investors\\\". However, he suggests that reacceleration in this segment could occur as early as next year, saying there were some macro headwinds for the business in the quarter.\\n\\\"I think it's important to take a step back, look at the bigger picture here,\\\" Bracelin told Yahoo Finance. He points out that it took Microsoft 13 years to build the Azure business to its current state, investing nearly $179 billion. \\\"We're talking now adding the next $100 billion in three years, so you're gonna compress 13 years of capex spend in three years to add the next $100 billion.\\\"\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.\\nThis post was written by Angel Smith\\n\",\n          \"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. will invest $2.9 billion over the next two years to boost its hyperscale cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Japan, marking its biggest investment in the country.\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\nIsrael Versus Iran \\u2014 What All-Out War Could Look Like\\nTexas Warns of Possible Power Emergency Next Week\\nApple Faces Worst iPhone Slump Since Covid as China Rivals Rise\\nIran\\u2019s Missile Barrage Was an Error Israel Can Gain From\\nIsrael Grapples With New Phase in Its Multi-Front War With Iran\\nThe announcement was made on Tuesday in Washington after Microsoft President Brad Smith met Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is in the US for the first official visit by a Japanese leader in nine years.

When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \\u201cchanged.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\\u201d\\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\\u00a0(see more details here).\\nImage by Tawanda Razika from Pixabay\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\\nWhile talking about Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Jim Cramer in a latest program referred to comments from CNBC host David Faber, who thinks big data center spending could \\u201cturn out to be a big waste of money.\\u201d\\nCramer wondered whether Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) data spending could also end up without big returns.\\n\\u201cI think Co-pilot and AI platform will be huge but will it be big enough to justify their investment, even if the stock sells for 37 times earnings, there is not enough room for failure.\\u201d\\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill recently chose Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) as his top enterprise AI pick. While talking to CNBC, the analyst said Microsoft is in \\u201cgreat shape\\u201d with its \\u201cCopilot strategy\\u201d for the back half of 2024.\\nDan Ives of Wedbush also believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \\u201clow teens for years to come\\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\\nMicrosoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\\u00a0 stock\\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\\n\\u201cThe Strategy trailed the Russell 3000 Index benchmark largely due to our diversified positioning, although we maintain a considerable portfolio allocation to large cap AI-related companies. These positions were indeed among our top contributors in the quarter, such as\\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is finding more ways to deploy AI for sustainability objectives such as its ability to better measure, predict and optimize complex systems, which can help its partner communities reduce wildfire risk.\\u201d\\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The beverage giant said it is exploring the use of AI to improve customer experiences, streamline operations, foster innovation, improve its competitive advantage, boost efficiency and discover growth opportunities.\\nCoca-Cola previously signed a five-year deal in 2020 for $250 million to use Microsoft's cloud and business software.\\nAs food and beverage manufacturers incorporate artificial intelligence into more facets of their operations to give them an advantage in the marketplace, they are spending big money to have access to the latest technology.\\u00a0Microsoft and Coca-Cola joined together four years ago, but since then the capabilities of AI have grown exponentially \\u2014 a big reason why Coca-Cola is committing to spend nearly five times more than it did the first time.\\n\\\"This new agreement builds on the success of Coca-Cola's partnership strategy with Microsoft, showing our commitment to ongoing digital transformation,\\\" John Murphy, president and chief financial officer at Coca-Cola, said in a statement.\\nIn 2023, Coca-Cola named Pratik Thakar as its global head of generative AI. The Sprite, Diet Coke and BodyArmor maker is using AI as a tool to connect with consumers. Last year, it launched Coca-Cola Y3000, a beverage the company said is the first flavor co-created with humans and AI.\\u00a0It also has used the technology to launch several experiential marketing campaigns.\\u00a0Coca-Cola is not the only company utilizing AI. Mars, AB InBev and McCormick & Co. also are incorporating it into their operations.\\n\",\n          \"Most artificial intelligence (AI) development happens in the cloud, with the help of tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate centralized data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia, and they rent the computing power to developers who use it to create AI applications.\\nPlus, developers can access ready-made large language models on Azure and AWS, including those from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic, to accelerate their progress.\\nAWS is the largest provider of cloud services and infrastructure in the world, followed by Azure in second place. However, Azure grew its revenue by 29% in the most recent quarter (ended June 30), with eight percentage points attributed to AI alone. AWS only grew its revenue by 19% during the same period, and the gap, while narrowing, has been a consistent theme:\\nMicrosoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure brings in, but it recently said the cloud platform was responsible for about half of its \\\"Microsoft Cloud\\\" revenue. During the latest quarter, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in revenue, implying Azure probably generated around $18.4 billion.\\nThat means it has a way to go to catch AWS, which generated $26.3 billion in revenue during its latest quarter. But with the current 10% growth differential, Azure could overtake AWS within five years -- and possibly even sooner if the growth gap widens to where it was earlier this year.\\nMicrosoft became an early mover in the AI race when it agreed to invest $10 billion in OpenAI in 2023. The start-up's latest GPT-4o models are among the best in the industry, and they are now available on Azure. That could be a key consideration for developers when selecting a cloud provider.\\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\\u2019t one of them.

When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \\u201cchanged.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\\u201d\\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\\u00a0(see more details here).\\nImage by Tawanda Razika from Pixabay\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\\nWhile talking about Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Jim Cramer in a latest program referred to comments from CNBC host David Faber, who thinks big data center spending could \\u201cturn out to be a big waste of money.\\u201d\\nCramer wondered whether Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) data spending could also end up without big returns.\\n\\u201cI think Co-pilot and AI platform will be huge but will it be big enough to justify their investment, even if the stock sells for 37 times earnings, there is not enough room for failure.\\u201d\\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill recently chose Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) as his top enterprise AI pick. While talking to CNBC, the analyst said Microsoft is in \\u201cgreat shape\\u201d with its \\u201cCopilot strategy\\u201d for the back half of 2024.\\nDan Ives of Wedbush also believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \\u201clow teens for years to come\\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\\nMicrosoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working.

The beverage giant said it is exploring the use of AI to improve customer experiences, streamline operations, foster innovation, improve its competitive advantage, boost efficiency and discover growth opportunities.\\nCoca-Cola previously signed a five-year deal in 2020 for $250 million to use Microsoft's cloud and business software.\\nAs food and beverage manufacturers incorporate artificial intelligence into more facets of their operations to give them an advantage in the marketplace, they are spending big money to have access to the latest technology.\\u00a0Microsoft and Coca-Cola joined together four years ago, but since then the capabilities of AI have grown exponentially \\u2014 a big reason why Coca-Cola is committing to spend nearly five times more than it did the first time.\\n\\\"This new agreement builds on the success of Coca-Cola's partnership strategy with Microsoft, showing our commitment to ongoing digital transformation,\\\" John Murphy, president and chief financial officer at Coca-Cola, said in a statement.\\nIn 2023, Coca-Cola named Pratik Thakar as its global head of generative AI. The Sprite, Diet Coke and BodyArmor maker is using AI as a tool to connect with consumers. Last year, it launched Coca-Cola Y3000, a beverage the company said is the first flavor co-created with humans and AI.\\u00a0It also has used the technology to launch several experiential marketing campaigns.\\u00a0Coca-Cola is not the only company utilizing AI. Mars, AB InBev and McCormick & Co. also are incorporating it into their operations.\\n\",\n          \"Most artificial intelligence (AI) development happens in the cloud, with the help of tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate centralized data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia, and they rent the computing power to developers who use it to create AI applications.\\nPlus, developers can access ready-made large language models on Azure and AWS, including those from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic, to accelerate their progress.\\nAWS is the largest provider of cloud services and infrastructure in the world, followed by Azure in second place. However, Azure grew its revenue by 29% in the most recent quarter (ended June 30), with eight percentage points attributed to AI alone. AWS only grew its revenue by 19% during the same period, and the gap, while narrowing, has been a consistent theme:\\nMicrosoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure brings in, but it recently said the cloud platform was responsible for about half of its \\\"Microsoft Cloud\\\" revenue. During the latest quarter, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in revenue, implying Azure probably generated around $18.4 billion.\\nThat means it has a way to go to catch AWS, which generated $26.3 billion in revenue during its latest quarter. But with the current 10% growth differential, Azure could overtake AWS within five years -- and possibly even sooner if the growth gap widens to where it was earlier this year.\\nMicrosoft became an early mover in the AI race when it agreed to invest $10 billion in OpenAI in 2023. The start-up's latest GPT-4o models are among the best in the industry, and they are now available on Azure. That could be a key consideration for developers when selecting a cloud provider.\\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\\u2019t one of them.

over companies from various sectors the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for of the index all of them being tech stocks there is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether nasdaq will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances nasdaq has finished stronger during the back half of the year there have only been two years between and during which nasdaqs yearend returns were lower than firsthalf returns however fundstrat global advisors tom lee who is generally bullish on the stock market told cnbc earlier this month that investors need to be cautious as stocks could fall during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the

money and nailed most stock calls this year other analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections liz young thomas the head of investment strategy at sofi while talking to business insider noted that stock activity lags between june and august while traders are on vacation this results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes the activity jumps up significantly in september when they return to their desks which often leads to stock price volatility according to her a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in september however during election years the volatility is at its peak in midoctober instead of september and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced lpl financials adam turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead but pointed out like lee did that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes buying the september or october lows has been a very good trade october things start to improve and then you have this november december yearend rally typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months both turnquist and young thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is shortterm and

When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \\u201cchanged.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\\u201d\\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\\u00a0(see more details here).\\nImage by Tawanda Razika from Pixabay\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\\nWhile talking about Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Jim Cramer in a latest program referred to comments from CNBC host David Faber, who thinks big data center spending could \\u201cturn out to be a big waste of money.\\u201d\\nCramer wondered whether Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) data spending could also end up without big returns.\\n\\u201cI think Co-pilot and AI platform will be huge but will it be big enough to justify their investment, even if the stock sells for 37 times earnings, there is not enough room for failure.\\u201d\\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill recently chose Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) as his top enterprise AI pick. While talking to CNBC, the analyst said Microsoft is in \\u201cgreat shape\\u201d with its \\u201cCopilot strategy\\u201d for the back half of 2024.\\nDan Ives of Wedbush also believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \\u201clow teens for years to come\\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\\nMicrosoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\\u00a0 stock\\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\\n\\u201cThe Strategy trailed the Russell 3000 Index benchmark largely due to our diversified positioning, although we maintain a considerable portfolio allocation to large cap AI-related companies. These positions were indeed among our top contributors in the quarter, such as\\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is finding more ways to deploy AI for sustainability objectives such as its ability to better measure, predict and optimize complex systems, which can help its partner communities reduce wildfire risk.\\u201d\\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The beverage giant said it is exploring the use of AI to improve customer experiences, streamline operations, foster innovation, improve its competitive advantage, boost efficiency and discover growth opportunities.\\nCoca-Cola previously signed a five-year deal in 2020 for $250 million to use Microsoft's cloud and business software.\\nAs food and beverage manufacturers incorporate artificial intelligence into more facets of their operations to give them an advantage in the marketplace, they are spending big money to have access to the latest technology.\\u00a0Microsoft and Coca-Cola joined together four years ago, but since then the capabilities of AI have grown exponentially \\u2014 a big reason why Coca-Cola is committing to spend nearly five times more than it did the first time.\\n\\\"This new agreement builds on the success of Coca-Cola's partnership strategy with Microsoft, showing our commitment to ongoing digital transformation,\\\" John Murphy, president and chief financial officer at Coca-Cola, said in a statement.\\nIn 2023, Coca-Cola named Pratik Thakar as its global head of generative AI. The Sprite, Diet Coke and BodyArmor maker is using AI as a tool to connect with consumers. Last year, it launched Coca-Cola Y3000, a beverage the company said is the first flavor co-created with humans and AI.\\u00a0It also has used the technology to launch several experiential marketing campaigns.\\u00a0Coca-Cola is not the only company utilizing AI. Mars, AB InBev and McCormick & Co. also are incorporating it into their operations.\\n\",\n          \"Most artificial intelligence (AI) development happens in the cloud, with the help of tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate centralized data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia, and they rent the computing power to developers who use it to create AI applications.\\nPlus, developers can access ready-made large language models on Azure and AWS, including those from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic, to accelerate their progress.\\nAWS is the largest provider of cloud services and infrastructure in the world, followed by Azure in second place. However, Azure grew its revenue by 29% in the most recent quarter (ended June 30), with eight percentage points attributed to AI alone. AWS only grew its revenue by 19% during the same period, and the gap, while narrowing, has been a consistent theme:\\nMicrosoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure brings in, but it recently said the cloud platform was responsible for about half of its \\\"Microsoft Cloud\\\" revenue. During the latest quarter, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in revenue, implying Azure probably generated around $18.4 billion.\\nThat means it has a way to go to catch AWS, which generated $26.3 billion in revenue during its latest quarter. But with the current 10% growth differential, Azure could overtake AWS within five years -- and possibly even sooner if the growth gap widens to where it was earlier this year.\\nMicrosoft became an early mover in the AI race when it agreed to invest $10 billion in OpenAI in 2023. The start-up's latest GPT-4o models are among the best in the industry, and they are now available on Azure. That could be a key consideration for developers when selecting a cloud provider.\\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\\u2019t one of them.
