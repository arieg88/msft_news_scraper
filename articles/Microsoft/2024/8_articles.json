        "Text": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its \u201cBaron Opportunity Fund\u201d second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the fund rose 4.35% (Institutional Shares), lagged the Russell 3000 Growth Index, which gained 7.80%, and essentially matched the S&P 500 Index, which advanced 4.28%. In the first half of 2024, the fund posted solid gains, rising 20.44% compared to a 19.90% return for the Russell 3000 Growth Index and beating the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 15.29% gain. After a slow start to the quarter, U.S. stocks increased steadily in May and June. Increased worries about inflation, the pace of expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, and growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East were blamed for the early market weakness. In addition, you can check the fund's top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024.\nBaron Opportunity Fund highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions. The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was -4.51%, and its shares gained 31.74% of their value over the last three months. On August 20, 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $424.80 per share with a market capitalization of $3.158 trillion.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\"\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in second position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) says more of its customers are signing up for and using its generative AI-based Copilot software, a sign that its AI investments are beginning to pay off.\nThe tech giant is pouring billions of dollars into its AI efforts as it seeks to spread the technology across its Azure-based cloud offerings, suite of productivity products, and Windows operating system.\nAnd according to Jared Spataro, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of AI at work, the company is seeing sizable gains in usage of its Copilot for Microsoft 365.\n\u201cLast quarter, the number of Copilot for [Microsoft 365] customers increased by more than 60%, which is great because we were already off to the races with that,\u201d Spataro told Yahoo Finance.\n\u201cDaily users more than doubled, and we love that trend. When we start to see that type of intensity of usage doubling, it means that you're really onto something,\u201d added Spataro.\nDuring its most recent earnings report, Microsoft announced Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, which includes its Azure services, of $28.5 billion. That was just short of Wall Street\u2019s expectation of $28.7 billion. And while that was a 19% year-over-year revenue increase, investors reacted negatively to the news, sending shares lower following the earnings announcement.\nThough Microsoft\u2019s stock price has rebounded, it\u2019s still up roughly 1.5% over the last six months, compared to rival Google's stock (GOOG, GOOGL), which is up more than 20%.\nMicrosoft\u2019s near miss shows how fine a line hyperscalers and software vendors must tread between investing in AI and showing that those investments are paying off.\nAccording to Spataro, the number of 10,000-seat subscriptions for Copilot for Microsoft 365 has doubled with big-name organizations including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, and Novartis. Microsoft, however, didn\u2019t provide exact information on daily or monthly active user numbers or how many Copilot for Microsoft 365 licenses it\u2019s sold.\nThe key to Copilot\u2019s success is proving that it saves enterprise users time on tasks, whether that\u2019s reducing the length of meetings, cutting down on how long it takes to sort through emails, or helping to brainstorm ideas.\nSo far, Microsoft says its customers are seeing results. Networking and cybersecurity company Lumen\u2019s employees are saving four hours per week in work using Copilot, which should result in a $50 million annual savings. Cognizant, for its part, says it\u2019s seen a 10% reduction in time spent on emails and a 27% increase in employees ending meetings early, Spataro explained.\nIt\u2019s not all good news for Microsoft, however. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported on customer reactions to Copilot, with some users complaining about the software\u2019s tendency to make mistakes in scheduling or summarizing meetings.\nAccording to a Morgan Stanley research note seen by Business Insider, an executive at a pharmaceutical company that was using Copilot canceled an upgrade it ordered for the software, saying the price didn\u2019t match the value they were getting out of it.\nSpataro, however, says Microsoft has performed its own six-month study of 60 companies and found that those firms saw a 50% decrease in email usage thanks to Copilot. Microsoft also says it performed a survey of 1,300 Copilot users and found that it typically takes companies 11 weeks and they need to see a time savings of at least 11 minutes per day for their Copilot habits to stick for the long term.\n\u201cThis is a moment of kind of reprogramming how work gets done,\u201d Spataro said. \u201cIt is not just an incremental change.\u201d\nIn a separate Morgan Stanley research note, analysts found that 94% of chief information officers surveyed said they expect to use Microsoft\u2019s generative AI services over the next 12 months. That\u2019s up from just 47% in the second quarter of 2023.\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t alone in its race to bring generative AI-powered software to its enterprise customers. Google is also offering its Gemini for Workspace to customers, while Salesforce is pushing its own generative AI software as well.\nMicrosoft is also in the midst of rolling out Copilot-based updates for its Windows operating system, including its Recall feature, which was initially pulled from release due to security concerns.\nMicrosoft will need to continue building out its base of Copilot users as it works to take market share in the space and ensure it holds onto its leadership position in enterprise software. That said, the generative AI revolution is still in its early stages, and Microsoft\u2019s rivals are circling.\nAnd with investors paying close attention to Microsoft\u2019s AI moves, it will need to consistently deliver on its AI goals if it\u2019s going to succeed in this new era of computing.\nCorrection: The number of 10,000-seat subscriptions for Copilot for Microsoft 365 has doubled.

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Leading the Charge in AI and Beyond",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Stocks That Will Change the World. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks.\nIf we were to try and summarize one of the biggest ways how to make money on the stock market, it\u2019d include buying stocks of firms that have changed the world. The biggest and\u00a0most valuable companies\u00a0of today didn\u2019t start that way, and those who had a chance to invest in them decades back are considerably well off and some are even among the richest people in the world.\nIn fact, the two biggest technologies that have changed the world since the 1970s are personal computing and the Internet. Within these, the former is older and started through the launch of products such as Windows and the Mac. The two companies that make these products are up by 405,920% and 166,238% on the stock market since their shares were listed. So, if you, or anyone you know, had bought $1,000 of shares back then, your investment would be worth $4 million or $1.7 million today.\nAlong with personal computing, the Internet is the second world changing technology that has not only reformed the way in which businesses operate and regular people live their lives but also left a slew of billionaires in its wake. Starting from the dotcom era of the 1990s, the few companies that did survive the \u2018pop\u2019 are among the largest and most valuable in the world today. These have managed to use the power of the Internet to change the way people shop and access information. The former, founded by Jeff Bezos, whose latest net worth is estimated to sit at $190 billion, is up 185,389% since its stock started trading.\nA $1,000 investment back then would be worth $1.9 million. Similarly, the world\u2019s largest search engine company and the\u00a0world\u2019s biggest social media firm, are up by 5,939% and 1,254% since their stock started trading in the 2000s. It\u2019s a testament to the power of world changing technologies to drive stock prices that these quad digit percentage returns appear to be \u2018meager\u2019 when compared to the six digit returns of the world changing stocks that have been trading since the 1970s and the 1990s.\nBut what about 2024? After all, while these disruptive stocks have made their mark on Wall Street history, it is highly unlikely that they will yield similar returns in the future. Well, one disruptive technology that has caught the world by storm is artificial intelligence. Spurred by the public launch of the chatbot ChatGPT, AI\u2019s proponents swear that it will transform the world just like the Internet did. This transformation is being spearheaded by big tech, as the\u00a0largest technology companies in the world\u00a0fork out billions of dollars in AI spending.\nData shows that during the first half of 2024, the four biggest AI players spent a whopping $106 billion in spending as part of a game theory-esque roulette that Mark Zuckerberg described as risking \u201cbuilding capacity before it is needed, rather than too late.\u201d As for the future, analysts expect that AI spending over the next five years could touch a\u00a0whopping\u00a0$1 trillion. This spending has also driven the shares of the world\u2019s pre eminent AI GPU maker (and the youngest game changing stock) to rise by 261,775% since they started trading.\nLooking at these gains makes it even more important that we try to wager a guess at what future industries can change the world. One way to somewhat simplify our research is to look at what investment newsletters are saying. The writers of these newsletters are often on the hunt for high growth sectors since correctly identifying them leads to a boost of credibility that drives subscriptions and eventually leads to revenue. On this front, we looked at some such industries as part of our coverage of\u00a010 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\nWithin these industries, two that stand out are quantum computing and nuclear energy. For those out of the loop, quantum computing is an expansion of current computing as it significantly increases the data that a computer can compute. However, quantum computing stocks are laggards in the stock market. We covered top hedge fund quantum computing stock picks during our coverage of\u00a012 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In. Out of these 12 stocks, 10 either have quantum computing returns baked into their stock price or are too important in the industry to ignore. Analyzing their year to date performance reveals that out of these ten quantum computing stocks, four are in the green and this drops to three if we focus only on pureplay quantum computing stocks. These three stocks rank\u00a05th,\u00a07th,\u00a0and\u00a012th\u00a0on our list, and they are up by 2.7% to 129.75%, year to date.\nFor nuclear energy, let\u2019s look at the stocks that are part of the list of the\u00a012 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Buy Today. In this list, roughly seven nuclear energy stocks have considerable exposure to power generation. Their one year share price appreciation ranges between 79.8% to 11.38%, and the top three performing stocks are ranked\u00a03rd,\u00a05th,\u00a0and\u00a012th.\u00a0As a refresher, nuclear energy is popular these days because of its potential to provide clean energy to AI data centers.\nFinally, another sector that might change the world is robotics. Some Wall Street analysts are gushing over the sector as they believe that humanoid robots in particular can unlock a $30 trillion opportunity. This is on the back of these robots being able to perform jobs that humans are unwilling or unsuited for, and even Elon Musk is bullish on them as he believes that his car company could benefit from this unstoppable demand and become worth $25 trillion as a result.

Then, we scanned media reports for sectors such as AI, self driving, gene editing, weight loss drugs, and robotics. From these reports, a stock was chosen if it was mentioned in three or more reports. This yielded a final list of five new stocks.\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q1 2024: 293\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. It is also one of the key players in the artificial intelligence industry by having partnered up with OpenAI. Microsoft is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and its capital expenditure sat at a whopping $55.7 billion for the June 2024 fiscal year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) benefits from its considerable enterprise computing market share through the Azure platform, which also provides it with a sizeable market to sell its AI products. At the same time, investor expectations for a return on its AI investments are high, and the firm\u2019s earnings calls are often beset with weak share price movement as it continues to provide weak AI related returns. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is present on both our lists since the media believes that along with AI, it can also play a crucial role in the autonomous driving industry.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s\u00a0latest earnings call\u00a0was one such event, where the shares only started to recover when management explained:\n\u201cFor Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency, or US$28.6 billion to US$28.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per-user business will continue to moderate.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that will change the world. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a010 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Is Microsoft Stock a Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently closed its fiscal year 2024 with its fourth-quarter earnings report. It's remarkable that the world's second-largest company by market cap, a behemoth with over $200 billion in annual revenue, can still grow as it does. Microsoft's Q4 earnings topped Wall Street's expectations in both revenue and profits, yet the stock sold off somewhat on the news.\nAre there signs of trouble buried in the fine print of Microsoft's quarter? This Fool analyzed earnings to find out what went right, what went wrong, and whether the stock is buyable today.\nIf you forgot how prevalent Microsoft's products are in society, look no further than the recent IT outage, which froze millions of computers worldwide, affecting airlines, banks, and other services. Microsoft touches virtually all areas of worldwide technology today. Its software powers personal and enterprise computer systems. Azure, its cloud platform, is a foundation for the internet. The company also owns leading gaming brands, the networking site LinkedIn, and more.\nIt's remarkable that Microsoft is so diverse, yet is putting up strong growth across the board. Sales of commercial Office 365 software grew 12% year over year, and personal 365 subscriptions increased to 82.5 million, from 80.8 million three months ago. LinkedIn revenue grew 10% year over year. Azure and other cloud services grew revenue by 29% on artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds. Even Windows, which has been around since the 1980s, grew sales by 7%. Overall, Microsoft's Q4 revenue grew 15% year over year to $64.7 billion. Earnings per share came in at $2.95, up 10% over last year.\nInvestors might not fully appreciate how impressive it is that such a large, complex company with many moving parts can generate double-digit growth across almost the entire business.\nIf there was a blemish, Azure's 29% growth came up short of the 30% to 31% target that management forecasted the previous quarter. Though the stock hasn't plummeted, the modest sell-off seems to be due to this perceived miss on Azure growth. However, management gave some critical context in the Q4 earnings call.\nSpecifically, management noted that Azure AI doesn't have enough capacity to fulfill demand. AI alone contributed eight percentage points to Azure's growth. Microsoft's Azure AI customer base grew to over 60,000 in Q4, up 60% from a year ago, and spend per customer is growing. Microsoft spent $19 billion on capital expenditures in Q4, virtually all of it on cloud and AI. Management forecasted higher spending in 2025 to accommodate strong AI demand.\nAzure AI likely would have grown more in Q4 if it had the capacity. This is a good problem -- it signals long-term growth opportunities as data center capacity increases.\nThe cloud business is Microsoft's largest and fastest-growing segment, and it should continue driving total growth as AI capacity comes online.\nAnalysts estimate that Microsoft will grow earnings by an average of 16% annually over the next three to five years. That seems reasonable, given the company's current revenue growth. Capital investments should also moderate over time, and those dollars should flow back to earnings.\nOverall, Microsoft's growth prospects look great. However, shares still trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35 times the company's 2024 earnings. The resulting price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2.2 is steep, even for a company growing earnings like Microsoft. The market has been willing to pay for the stock: Microsoft's average P/E ratio is 32 over the past five years.\nIt seems that Microsoft is probably a little overvalued today, and that could help explain why the market sold the stock on the slightest imperfection in its earnings report. Investors shouldn't rush to buy Microsoft. The stock market will inevitably stumble, and investors may get a better buying opportunity on high-flying stocks like Microsoft.\nPatience could pay off in Microsoft's case.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chilton.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other safe stocks recommended by billionaire Richard Chilton.\nChilton Investment Company, founded by Richard L. Chilton, Jr. in 1992, aims to achieve appealing long-term returns while minimizing volatility. Since its establishment, the company has diligently adhered to a fundamental bottom-up investment approach, characterized by an ownership mindset. Its primary aim is to acquire fractional ownership in outstanding businesses rather than engaging in short-term stock trading.\nRichard L. Chilton Jr. is the chairman, CEO, and chief investment officer of Chilton Investment Co. He has been a hedge fund manager for 18 years, which is a significant tenure in the challenging hedge fund industry. Chilton began his career in 1983 as an analyst with Alliance Capital Management, working alongside small-cap equity managers Frank Burr and Paul Jenkel. In 1990, he started a money management business for Allen & Co., a private bank, but left after two years to establish his own hedge fund company.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a011 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Analyst Ratings\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett Disciple Guy Spier\u2019s 10 High Conviction Stock Picks.\nDrawing on lessons in shorting stocks learned from Julian Robertson of Tiger Management Corp., Chilton set up his firm in a small, one-room office in New York, managing a classic long/short equity hedge fund. Chilton\u2019s decision to start his own hedge fund was influenced by Art Samberg, a board member of the mutual fund Chilton co-managed. After expressing his desire to leave Allen & Co., where he had established a money management business, Samberg encouraged him to start his own fund, recognizing his talent. In January 1992, Chilton left Allen & Co., declined an offer from CEO Herbert Allen to buy a stake in his new venture, and instead accepted $1 million in investment from Allen, combining it with family money to launch his hedge fund with $5 million.\nStarting his hedge fund in July 1992, Chilton aimed to create a classic long/short equity hedge fund, inspired by the first hedge fund model launched by Alfred Winslow Jones. His strategy was to always remain both long and short, without attempting to time the market. Chilton's reputation grew through word of mouth, attracting prominent investors, endowments, and foundations. Pension funds later followed.\nChilton Investment\u2019s appeal to institutional investors lies in its client-first approach and strong performance. The firm has been a leader in transparency and SEC registration. During the 2008 financial crisis, Chilton allowed clients to withdraw funds, which later returned. Chilton\u2019s background in managing pension money at Alliance Capital gave him crucial experience in transparency and accountability, making his firm attractive for investors seeking long/short strategies. Chilton sees current opportunities in blue-chip companies with strong financials, solid dividend yields, and steady earnings growth. He expects these \"dividend aristocrats\" to outperform in a flat S&P environment, offering stability and consistent returns through growing dividends. Today, Chilton's firm has grown significantly, with offices worldwide, a team of sector specialist analysts, and $7 billion under management across various strategies in global markets.\nRichard L. Chilton Jr. graduated with a B.S. degree in Finance and Economics from Alfred University. Acknowledged for his business acumen, Forbes ranks Richard Chilton 773rd among the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals, estimating his net worth at $1.3 billion. Chilton Investment Company caters to 9 clients, managing discretionary assets totaling $1,266,939,000, as per their Form ADV dated March 2024. Their 13F filing for Q1 2024 revealed managed 13F securities amounting to $3.6 billion.\nOur Methodology\nThis article highlights the 10 safe stocks to buy according to billionaire Chilton, including analyst ratings and key details about each company, as well as the number of hedge funds invested in them.\nWhy focus on the stocks that hedge funds invest in? Our research shows that following the top picks of leading hedge funds can result in returns that beat the market. We use this strategy in our quarterly newsletter, where we choose 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks each quarter. Since May 2014, this approach has generated a 275% return, outperforming the benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nChilton Investment Company's Stake Value: $365,858,112\n\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 293\nTopping our list of safe stocks to buy according to billionaire Chilton is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands out as a compelling investment due to its dominant position in cloud computing through Azure, which continues to drive significant revenue growth. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s diverse portfolio, spanning software, gaming, and AI, offers multiple revenue streams and provides stability against market fluctuations.\nFrom April to June 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported total revenues of about $64.7 billion, marking a 15.2% increase compared to the same period in the previous year, when revenues were $56.2 billion. This figure slightly exceeded analysts' expectations, which had forecasted $64.4 billion. According to Cavenagh Research, updated projections for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s earnings per share (EPS) are expected to reach approximately $11.3 in 2024, $12.9 in 2025, and $13.4 in 2026.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best-run legacy businesses with competitive advantages in office productivity software, cloud, and AI. Its Azure cloud business is consistently gaining market share and Microsoft can leverage its tech prowess to deliver improved user experience in its office productivity tools. Microsoft Copilot is now integrated into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and GitHub, and the company is executing well on democratizing AI.\nIt's one of the safest stocks to buy according to Richard Chilton. Over the past 10 years, Microsoft's revenue has compounded at ~11% annually, and its net income has grown at a CAGR of ~15%. Chilton Investment Company owned 869,600 shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), valued at $365,858,112.\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the safe stocks to buy according to billionaire Chilton. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) After Its Annual Results",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The yearly results for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) were released last week, making it a good time to revisit its performance. Microsoft reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$245b and statutory earnings per share of US$11.80, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Microsoft's 49 analysts is for revenues of US$278.7b in 2025. This would reflect a notable 14% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 11% to US$13.21. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$280.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$13.36 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\nThere were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$498, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Microsoft analyst has a price target of US$600 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$430. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 14% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 13% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. It's clear that while Microsoft's revenue growth is expected to continue on its current trajectory, it's only expected to grow in line with the industry itself.\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$498, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Microsoft going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here..\nYou should always think about risks though.

Wood\u2019s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.\nInvestors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024. The fund is on track to post its worst year of investor exodus since 2014. But Cathie Wood is doubling down on her innovation bets and is hopeful the upcoming rate cuts will be positive for the stock market.\nCathie Wood Says \u201cSomething Is Changing\u201d and the Fed is Now on \u201cHigh Alert\u201d\nTalking about the market situation, Cathie Wood said in a\u00a0latest video\u00a0on her YouTube channel that the recent selloff shows the market is going through a \u201ccathartic\u201d phase and \u201csomething is changing.\u201d\n\u201cI do believe that the Fed now is on high alert because the stock market seemed to be encouraging the Fed to hold tight, higher for longer, make sure that the inflation was out of the system.\u201d\nCathie Wood said that corporations are now in a weaker position amid high rates and they will initiate layoffs to cut costs and increase productivity. This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.\n\u201cInterest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nCathie Wood\u2019s Latest Stake Value: $15,279,433\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company\u2019s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top absolute contributors were Alphabet,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure\u2019s revenue growth in the most recent quarter.

Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings.

        "Author": "  Umar Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list 10 Best Enterprise Software Stocks to Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other enterprise software stocks.\nEnterprise software is integral to the functioning of modern businesses, offering a range of applications designed to streamline and optimize various essential activities. These include enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), business intelligence (BI), supply chain management (SCM), and more. The market is structured around eight core segments based on the functionality of the software: Business Intelligence Software, Content Management Software, Customer Relationship Management Software, eCommerce Software, Enterprise Performance Management Software, Enterprise Resource Planning Software, Supply Chain Management Software, and other specialized enterprise software solutions. The market\u2019s evolution is driven by several key factors. Businesses worldwide are increasingly adopting digital transformation strategies, which are fueling demand for flexible, scalable, and user-friendly software solutions. Cloud-based software, or Software as a Service (SaaS), has become particularly popular due to its adaptability and ease of integration with other systems. Companies are also seeking software that can help them reduce costs, streamline operations, and improve their overall performance.\nGeographically, the United States leads the enterprise software market, driven by the high demand for cloud-based solutions and the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies. In Europe, the market is propelled by the need for digital transformation and compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Asia-Pacific region is experiencing growth due to the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions and the rise of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In China, the market is dominated by domestic companies due to government restrictions on foreign firms, while in India, the market benefits from the proliferation of mobile devices and startups. Latin America\u2019s market is driven by the need for regulatory compliance and efficient business management solutions.\nThe enterprise software market is influenced by various macroeconomic factors, including GDP growth, technological innovation, and government regulations. As businesses across the globe strive to stay competitive in an increasingly digital world, the demand for advanced software solutions continues to rise. The growing adoption of cloud-based platforms is particularly significant, as companies seek to enhance their flexibility while reducing operational costs. Additionally, government regulations play a crucial role in shaping the market, affecting the adoption of certain software types and the ability of foreign companies to operate in specific regions.\nAccording to Statista, the Enterprise Software market is poised for remarkable growth in 2024, with revenue expected to reach a staggering $295.20 billion. At the forefront of this expansive market is Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Software, which alone is projected to generate $89.30 billion in revenue. The overall market is anticipated to continue its upward trajectory with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.35% from 2024 to 2029, resulting in a projected market volume of $401.60 billion by the end of the forecast period. A key metric within the industry, the average spend per employee, is expected to reach $82.91 in 2024, underscoring the growing importance of enterprise software in driving business efficiency and productivity. The United States stands as the dominant player in the global market, with projected revenue of $150.50 billion in 2024, reflecting its leadership in innovation and technology adoption.\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is increasingly recognized as a significant growth area within the broader Enterprise Software and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) markets, particularly as more corporations begin upgrading their finance applications. This critical functional area has been somewhat neglected in recent years, but it is now gaining attention as businesses seek to enhance their financial management capabilities. Unlike other software segments where the public cloud has become the dominant delivery model, ERP within the enterprise software landscape is expected to see a more balanced adoption of both public and private cloud solutions. This hybrid approach allows enterprises to leverage the flexibility and scalability of the public cloud while maintaining the security and control offered by private cloud environments, which is crucial for managing sensitive financial data and complex business processes. The public-cloud ERP market, a key segment of the enterprise software industry, includes applications for finance, planning, procurement, and asset management, and is on track for substantial growth. According to IDC data, this market is projected to expand from $36 billion in 2021 to an impressive $73 billion by 2026, representing a strong annual growth rate of 15%. Despite its potential, ERP has been slower to migrate to the cloud compared to other types of enterprise software, with approximately 48% of ERP systems still operating on-premise. However, as large corporations increasingly seek deeper insights into their operations and the ability to scale efficiently, the push toward cloud-based ERP solutions is accelerating. This shift is driven by the need for more integrated and flexible systems that can adapt to the evolving demands of modern businesses.\nGiven the robust growth prospects and the vital role enterprise software plays in today\u2019s business landscape, this article will explore the 10 best enterprise software stocks to buy now. These companies are well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing digital transformation and the increasing reliance on sophisticated software solutions by businesses worldwide. Investing in these stocks offers an opportunity to participate in the growth of a dynamic and essential industry.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) expanding dividend makes it a compelling buy. Over the past decade, the dividend has nearly tripled, with annual hikes averaging about 10%. Despite spending over $21 billion on dividends annually, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) low payout ratio of 25% keeps this cost manageable. Although the company has cut back on stock buybacks to increase spending on growth and AI, it continues to repurchase shares enough to prevent dilution. With a P/E ratio of 33.8, analysts consider Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as reasonably priced compared to its large-cap peers. In its latest earnings announcement on July 30, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported a normalized EPS of $2.95, exceeding expectations by $0.01. The company\u2019s revenue reached $64.73 billion, beating estimates by $287.80 million.\nDespite concerns over margin impacts from generative AI investments, the company\u2019s growth in AI-driven areas like Azure and GitHub remains strong.

        "Title": "Is Microsoft Stock a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Stefon Walters, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For much of the past year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) enjoyed the esteemed title of the world's most valuable public company. An artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled boost -- and underperformance from Apple -- helped propel Microsoft into the top spot, but a recent sell-off erased more than $300 billion in market cap over the past month (as of July 29).\nThis sell-off has affected many tech companies, sparking rumors of a market correction coming soon. Given the uncertainty and recent performance of Microsoft's stock, many may wonder if it's a buy. Many factors contribute to that answer, but for long-term investors, it remains a yes.\nMicrosoft is far from immune to market corrections and downturns, but it is much more insulated from huge business hits than most other tech companies. This is mostly because many of Microsoft's customers are other companies.\nThink about the products and services that businesses globally rely on from Microsoft. Countless companies rely on Excel for spreadsheet needs, Teams to communicate with coworkers, and other Office software for productivity. Windows PCs fill the office spaces of thousands of businesses. LinkedIn is one of the most used recruiting platforms, and Azure is the world's second-leading cloud computing platform.\nWhile other big tech companies rely heavily on consumer spending (such as Apple with its hardware) or the success of a product line (such as Nvidia with its GPUs), Microsoft has built an ecosystem with many parts that carry their own weight.\nThis has been a huge factor in Microsoft's consistent revenue and operating income (profit from core operations) growth over the past decade. In Microsoft's third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended March 31), revenue and operating income increased 17% and 23% year over year, respectively.\nAs the digital world evolved and become more connected, cloud services have become an essential part of many companies' operations and infrastructure. Amazon, with its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), had the foresight to see this transformation and got a jump on the industry. This is mainly why AWS remains the world's leading cloud platform.\nMicrosoft's cloud platform Azure trails behind AWS in market share (25% to 31%), but it has been picking up a lot of steam and gaining ground. Just three years ago, Azure's market share was around 19%.\nMicrosoft Cloud's revenue grew 23% year over year to $35.1 billion and accounted for close to 57% of its total revenue in its latest quarter. Azure and other cloud services' revenue specifically increased 31% year over year. As its cloud business grows -- particularly as it integrates OpenAI's AI technologies into its products -- Microsoft should continue to see impressive profit growth.\nDespite the growth in Microsoft's earnings recently, its stock price growth has kept its valuation at a premium. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is just under 37, well over its average over the past five years and noticeably above the S&P 500's roughly 27.5.\nWith Microsoft's premium valuation, investors must manage their short-term expectations because it could make the stock more susceptible to volatility if market sentiment toward tech stocks (and AI's lasting effect) changes. In the long term, though, Microsoft's prospects are as strong as ever.\nA good approach to Microsoft's stock is to dollar-cost average your investments. Decide on a set amount you can dedicate to the stock and then decide how often you want to make your investments. This can help reduce some volatility risks and keep the focus on making consistent investments over the long haul instead of figuring out the \"best time\" to invest.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $717,050!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 17 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and Billionaire Druckenmiller is Betting on AI\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders have seen the share price descend 13% over the month. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 201% in that time. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.\nSince the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nOver half a decade, Microsoft managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 25% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Microsoft's TSR for the last 5 years was 215%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nWe're pleased to report that Microsoft shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 26% a year, is even better. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Microsoft  that you should be aware of.\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other beginner stocks.\nWhile investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.\nOver the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.\nNevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.\nAdditionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.\nOn August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.\nMinkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven\u2019t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.\nFor beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.\nHowever, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven\u2019t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.\nThe U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.\nIn the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\u201cAccording to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify large to mega-cap stocks with a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 5% over the last 10 years. The companies we chose are well-known, well-established, fundamentally strong, and some also pay regular dividends. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 10.94%\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prominent American multinational technology company. It runs through three main business segments, Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.\nThe Productivity and Business Processes segment includes offerings such as Office Commercial, which covers Office 365 subscriptions and Microsoft Teams, and Office Consumer products like Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. This segment also has LinkedIn and Dynamics 365, a collection of cloud-based applications designed for enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM).\nThe Intelligent Cloud segment focuses on a range of server products and services, including public, private, and hybrid solutions. Major products of this segment are Microsoft Azure, SQL Server, and Windows Server, along with developer tools such as Visual Studio and GitHub.\nThe More Personal Computing segment features a variety of consumer-oriented products and services. This includes the Windows operating system, Surface devices, and Xbox hardware and content. It also includes search and news advertising through platforms like Bing and Microsoft Edge.\nIn the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion. As of June 30, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the most dominant shareholder in the company and has a position worth $15.6 billion.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is making significant strides in AI, a key area expected to drive future growth for the company. By partnering with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, the company has strategically integrated advanced AI technology into its offerings. The recent fiscal fourth-quarter results highlight the impact of this focus as the Azure OpenAI service saw a 60% increase in customers year-over-year and reached 60,000. Additionally, the average spending per Azure AI customer is on the rise, which reflects the growing value businesses see in its AI solutions.\nBeyond Azure, the company's AI efforts are also flourishing across its other platforms. GitHub Copilot is already generating more revenue than GitHub did before Microsoft's acquisition as per the company. Its Copilot AI assistant is now embedded in a range of products, from Microsoft 365 to Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. These integrations are driving transformation, particularly in Dynamics, where AI capabilities are improving business processes.\nIn terms of financial performance, Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) largest revenue segment, the Intelligent Cloud, saw a 20% increase in the fourth quarter. This segment includes Azure, where AI services contributed significantly to this growth, accounting for 8% of the 29% year-over-year revenue rise in cloud services. The company expects that its investments in AI will continue to boost Azure\u2019s growth in the second half of fiscal 2025.\nOverall, the company's focus on AI is not only enhancing its product offerings but also contributing to robust financial results. The company's revenue for the fourth quarter was $245 billion, a 16% increase while operating income grew 24% year-over-year to $109.4 billion. With these strong financials and the ongoing expansion in AI, the company is one of the best beginner stocks to buy now as it capitalizes on the transformative potential of AI.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nTech stocks are continuing to decline amid fears the Fed is taking too long to begin interest rate cuts, stoked by the latest jobs data that showed unemployment is rising. However, some analysts believe the latest decline in AI stocks is part of a normal market rotation and gives investors an opportunity to buy. While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a \u201clittle bit of a reset, obviously.\u201d The analyst said that AI stocks had a \u201cgreat run\u201d and the latest pullback is a \u201ctypical process\u201d of market rotation.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that\u2019s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,\u201d Landsberg said.\nAsked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and called the recent pullback \u201cdeceleration\u201d from growth and \u201cnormalization.\u201d\nLandsberg said that the earnings season will \u201cseparate the wheat from the chaff\u201d and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.\nFor this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nImage by Tawanda Razika from Pixabay\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company\u2019s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top absolute contributors were Alphabet,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure\u2019s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has lost 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nMicrosoft is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 points to a change of +10.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.02 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $64.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. For the current and next fiscal years, $277.39 billion and $314.94 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +13.5% changes, respectively.\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.84%. The EPS surprise was +1.72%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock is down more than 11% over the last month, brought down by multiple factors. A tech sell-off kicked off in July, fueled by concerns in the chip market and the beginning of earnings season. Then, Microsoft's stock was brought down further when the company released its fourth quarter of 2024 results.\nThe period beat expectations on several fronts, including revenue and earnings per share. However, a miss in its cloud division saw Microsoft's stock price tumble 7% in after-hours trading on July 30, as Wall Street grew wary of the company's prospects in artificial intelligence (AI).\nYet recent stock market fluctuations only highlight the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. Despite a dip, Microsoft remains a tech behemoth that has seen its share price rise 853% over the last decade. The company holds leading positions in multiple high-growth sectors, including productivity software, cloud computing, gaming, digital advertising, and AI.\nMicrosoft's prominence in tech and a recent dip might have some investors concerned that its stock has hit its ceiling and it's too late for new investors to see significant gains. However, tech is an ever-expanding industry that is moved forward by companies like Microsoft that consistently reinvest in their businesses.\nSo, here's why Microsoft remains a compelling buy this year.\nMicrosoft's Q4 2024 revenue rose 15% year over year to $65 billion, beating analysts' forecasts by $260 million. Earnings per share of $2.95 also outperformed Wall Street estimates by $0.02. Growth was primarily thanks to double-digit revenue jumps in its three main segments.\nHowever, the earnings beat was overshadowed by a miss in Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment, which posted revenue of $28.52 billion compared to expectations of $28.69. Despite the miss, the segment still reported year-over-year sales gains of 19%. Meanwhile, revenue from Azure and other cloud services soared 29%.\nMicrosoft's cloud performance largely represents its position in AI as its platform, Azure, offers a range of generative features. Considering the hype surrounding AI since the start of last year, Microsoft's slight miss sent Wall Street into a panic. However, the company maintains significant potential in the industry.\nRising cloud competition from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud means cloud growth will likely be gradual for Microsoft. However, the company's dominance in tech and diverse business model grants it multiple ways to expand in AI.\nThe second quarter of 2024 saw revenue in Microsoft's productivity and business processes segment increase by 11% year over year, alongside a 13% rise in Office Commercial products. The growth comes after the company introduced several new AI tools to its Office productivity suite, including Copilot, an AI assistant that boosts efficiency with language generation tools and is a $30 monthly add-on to a Microsoft 365 subscription.\nIn addition to cloud computing and productivity services, Microsoft has a consistently expanding personal computing business that posted sales growth of 14% year over year in the company's latest quarter. The segment allows another avenue for AI growth in the coming years as Microsoft's technology improves and AI PCs become a larger part of the PC market.\nMicrosoft is home to a thoroughly diverse business, which allows it to give areas like cloud computing time to flourish in AI. Outperforming estimates in Q4 2024 illustrate the reliability of Microsoft's business and leading role in tech.\nMicrosoft's stock has risen 21% in the last 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500's 17% rise. Meanwhile, its free cash flow has steadily climbed 17% to $74 billion, indicating that Microsoft is well equipped to continue investing in its business and keep up with its rivals.\nThe Windows company is on a promising growth path, with a recent dip in its share price only strengthening the bullish argument for its stock.\nAlong with a tumbling share price, Microsoft's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) have also decreased by 11%, representing a boost in its stock's value. The data in the table above shows Microsoft's P/E and P/S currently sit at 35 and 41.\nThese figures don't illustrate a significant bargain on their own. However, they are below Microsoft's 12-month averages for both metrics, indicating that its stock is a better value than it has been for most of the last year.\nIn addition to its diversified business model, potent role in tech, and vast cash reserves, Microsoft remains an attractive long-term investment. Its solid outlook suggests it is not too late to still enjoy major gains from this tech giant in the coming years.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Despite being seen as a key beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, primarily due to its strategic investment in OpenAI, Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has underperformed broader markets and its mega-cap peers this year. After a strong start, the stock has only gained about 7.10% year to date. This is a significant decline from its mid-July peak, where it was up nearly 25%.\nThe downturn can be attributed to weaker-than-expected near-term prospects at Azure following the latest earnings release and the broader global market sell-off driven by disappointing employment data, which heightened recessionary fears.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nMSFT Data by GuruFocus\nEven with this moderate sell-off, despite strong fourth-quarter earnings, I believe there is no reason to be less bullish on Microsoft now than a few months ago. The company's core fundamentals remain robust, with all three business segments continuing to show solid growth, led by the impressive performance of the Intelligent Cloud division. Microsoft's operating leverage remains resilient, and the company continues to be a free cash flow powerhouse, even as it ramps up research and development and capital expenditures. I see a clear path to double-digit forward returns, making Microsoft a compelling long-term opportunity.\nI have long held the view that Microsoft would be a frontrunner in the AI revolution, and the past year has only strengthened this belief. The company's operational momentum continues to build, reinforcing my confidence. Despite the market's overreaction to fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, I believe Microsoft still has significant growth potential. For investors who buy at current levels, this could be an excellent opportunity to secure substantial future gains. In this analysis, I will explain why I remain bullish on Microsoft and why I believe the market's response to the recent earnings report was unwarranted.\nDespite the expected deceleration in Azure's growth through the first half of fiscal 2025, Microsoft has witnessed substantial growth in recent quarters. Azure Cloud Services reported a 29% revenue increase in the fourth quarter, while Microsoft Cloud recorded a 21% rise, driven by the broader adoption of AI-enhanced services across its offerings. In recent times, the performance of Microsoft's quarters has largely hinged on Azure's success, and the fourth quarter was no exception. However, it is important to note the slowdown in Azure's growth was primarily due to AI-related capacity constraintsindicating a supply issue rather than a lack of demand. Demand for Azure AI remains robust, underscoring its pivotal role in driving the company's growth.\nMicrosoft, a significant client of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), is in fierce competition with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) within the cloud market. As of the first quarter of 2024, the company's share of the global cloud market grew from 22% to 25% over the prior four quarters, outpacing both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. While AWS has long been the leader in cloud computing, the competitive landscape is shifting. Recent developments suggest Azure could potentially overtake AWS as the leading cloud service provider by 2026. The Azure OpenAI service, which enables customers to build AI applications without the need for expensive hardware, is a critical driver of this growth. As Microsoft's AI and cloud services continue to evolve, the company is well-positioned to challenge AWS's dominance in the coming years.\nSource: Statista\nMicrosoft's aggressive investment in AI for Azure is attracting new customers and even luring AWS and GCP users to switch. The increasing revenue and profits generated from AI demonstrate the company's strategy is moving in the right direction, albeit at a steady pace rather than explosive growth. The current supply constraints highlight the overwhelming demand, justifying Microsoft's continued investment in AI. The company has outlined plans to invest billions in data centers and AI hubs globally, including a multibillion-dollar investment in Spain. Additionally, it has partnered with Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) to expand network capacity and support the rising demand on data centers.\nThis aggressive investment in AI infrastructure underscores management's strong conviction in capturing a share of the potential $1.30 trillion market opportunity. Microsoft's broad representation in the cloud value chain positions it well to anticipate and meet demand, making its continued investment in data center expansion a logical and necessary step.\nThe software giant delivered another robust quarter on July 30, surpassing revenue and earnings per share consensus estimates. The fourth quarter saw a 15.20% year-over-year increase in revenue, with adjusted earnings rising from $2.69 to $2.95 per share, driven in part by strong operating leverage. Notably, Microsoft Cloud posted 21% year-over-year growth, while Azure and Cloud Services recorded a 29% increase. Of the latter, 8% was driven by Microsoft's generative AI services, which, while contributing modestly, still reflects the significant impact of AI on Microsoft's largest growth segments. Contrary to market expectations for explosive growth, I view the current levels of growth as reasonable and on the right trajectory, likely to accelerate as Microsoft's substantial AI investments begin to pay off.\nSource: Microsoft's Investor Relations\nInvestors were disappointed by what they perceived as a slowdown in Azure's growth, which reported a 29% year-over-year increase (30% in constant currency), falling short of both the company's forecast of 30% to 31% and analysts' expectations of over 30%. However, I find it hard to label a 29% growth rate as a \"slowdown.\" The market's reaction, leading to a sell-off, seems irrational to me. Microsoft is not overbuilding; it is expanding its capacity to meet customer demand. As this capacity comes online through continued investments, I expect growth rates to pick up.\nThe transition to generative artificial intelligence at Microsoft is resource-intensive, with capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 reaching $45 billion and even higher expenditures for 2025, according to management forecasts. This has raised concerns about the company's profit margins moving forward. While Microsoft projects double-digit revenue and operating income growth, the increased capex will inevitably impact profitability. Investors should not expect significant margin expansion in the near term as operating margins are expected to hold steady with a slight decline of about 1%. However, in the longer term, as AI infrastructure investments stabilize and mature, I anticipate significant upward pressure on operating margins given the potential of AGI to drive widespread benefits.\nSource: Microsoft's Investor Relations\nMicrosoft's strong free cash flow generation is a testament to its solid operating leverage. The company generated $12.40 billion in levered FCF during the quarter, despite a $5 billion year-over-year increase in capex. This robust FCF has further strengthened its balance sheet, which now boasts a $75 billion cash reserve.\nThis financial flexibility positions Microsoft well for significant acquisitions, as evidenced by the $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal in 2023. Capex as a percentage of total revenue has surged from the low teens to the high teens, driven by the generative AI boom since 2023. Management has indicated that capex investments will increase materially in 2025, surpassing 2024 levels. While this elevated spending might create a near-term headwind on FCF, the strong demand outlook, supported by cloud migrations and AI adoption, justifies this strategic investment.\nFollowing the recent sell-off, Microsoft is trading at 21.50 times forward earnings, positioning it as an attractive pick among the Magnificent Seven. This valuation is slightly lower than Amazon's price-earnings ratio of 23 and Apple's ratio of 25, making Microsoft a compelling option, particularly since only Meta is trading at a cheaper valuation. I anticipate Microsoft maintaining a 25 to 30 times earnings multiple as its top-line growth moderates to the 6% to 8% range.\nThis outlook is underpinned by the company's strong net cash position, highly recurring revenue base and projected long-term net margins of 40% to 45%. Investors can expect returns driven by both top-line growth and earnings yield, with the added confidence that Microsoft has historically been a reliable buy during market pullbacks. Given the current market meltdown in the U.S. due to recessionary fears, now appears to be an ideal time to invest in a high-quality company at a reasonable price. Microsoft's strong financial performance across cycles further enhances its attractive return proposition.\nSource: valueinvesting.io\nFrom a discounted cash flow perspective, using a discount rate of 8.80% and a five-year exit Ebitda multiple of 21.80, aligned with peers, I derive a valuation of approximately $472 per share. This suggests an upside of 16.20% based on conservative estimates. This valuation reflects my belief that Microsoft is likely to maintain stability at current levels as management continues to execute on its AI roadmap.\nConsidering Microsoft's significant growth potential amid the AI boom, its integration of AI technology and continued increases in revenue and earnings, this valuation provides a substantial margin of safety. Additionally, the company's potential to expand and enhance revenue streams in emerging and developing markets is strong. The company is well-positioned to gain market share from AWS and GCP, particularly with its ongoing advancements in AI through its dedicated AI division. These initiatives are expected to further strengthen Microsoft's position in the tech industry, driving sustained growth and value creation for shareholders.\nDespite recent market overreactions and a temporary slowdown in Azure's growth, Microsoft's core fundamentals and strategic investments in AI underscore its long-term potential. The company remains a solid investment opportunity, especially in a volatile market, with strong financial performance and a well-positioned AI roadmap likely to drive future growth and value creation for shareholders.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

As this capacity comes online through continued investments, I expect growth rates to pick up.\nThe transition to generative artificial intelligence at Microsoft is resource-intensive, with capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 reaching $45 billion and even higher expenditures for 2025, according to management forecasts. This has raised concerns about the company's profit margins moving forward. While Microsoft projects double-digit revenue and operating income growth, the increased capex will inevitably impact profitability. Investors should not expect significant margin expansion in the near term as operating margins are expected to hold steady with a slight decline of about 1%. However, in the longer term, as AI infrastructure investments stabilize and mature, I anticipate significant upward pressure on operating margins given the potential of AGI to drive widespread benefits.\nSource: Microsoft's Investor Relations\nMicrosoft's strong free cash flow generation is a testament to its solid operating leverage. The company generated $12.40 billion in levered FCF during the quarter, despite a $5 billion year-over-year increase in capex. This robust FCF has further strengthened its balance sheet, which now boasts a $75 billion cash reserve.\nThis financial flexibility positions Microsoft well for significant acquisitions, as evidenced by the $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal in 2023. Capex as a percentage of total revenue has surged from the low teens to the high teens, driven by the generative AI boom since 2023. Management has indicated that capex investments will increase materially in 2025, surpassing 2024 levels. While this elevated spending might create a near-term headwind on FCF, the strong demand outlook, supported by cloud migrations and AI adoption, justifies this strategic investment.\nFollowing the recent sell-off, Microsoft is trading at 21.50 times forward earnings, positioning it as an attractive pick among the Magnificent Seven. This valuation is slightly lower than Amazon's price-earnings ratio of 23 and Apple's ratio of 25, making Microsoft a compelling option, particularly since only Meta is trading at a cheaper valuation. I anticipate Microsoft maintaining a 25 to 30 times earnings multiple as its top-line growth moderates to the 6% to 8% range.\nThis outlook is underpinned by the company's strong net cash position, highly recurring revenue base and projected long-term net margins of 40% to 45%. Investors can expect returns driven by both top-line growth and earnings yield, with the added confidence that Microsoft has historically been a reliable buy during market pullbacks. Given the current market meltdown in the U.S. due to recessionary fears, now appears to be an ideal time to invest in a high-quality company at a reasonable price. Microsoft's strong financial performance across cycles further enhances its attractive return proposition.\nSource: valueinvesting.io\nFrom a discounted cash flow perspective, using a discount rate of 8.80% and a five-year exit Ebitda multiple of 21.80, aligned with peers, I derive a valuation of approximately $472 per share. This suggests an upside of 16.20% based on conservative estimates. This valuation reflects my belief that Microsoft is likely to maintain stability at current levels as management continues to execute on its AI roadmap.\nConsidering Microsoft's significant growth potential amid the AI boom, its integration of AI technology and continued increases in revenue and earnings, this valuation provides a substantial margin of safety. Additionally, the company's potential to expand and enhance revenue streams in emerging and developing markets is strong. The company is well-positioned to gain market share from AWS and GCP, particularly with its ongoing advancements in AI through its dedicated AI division. These initiatives are expected to further strengthen Microsoft's position in the tech industry, driving sustained growth and value creation for shareholders.\nDespite recent market overreactions and a temporary slowdown in Azure's growth, Microsoft's core fundamentals and strategic investments in AI underscore its long-term potential. The company remains a solid investment opportunity, especially in a volatile market, with strong financial performance and a well-positioned AI roadmap likely to drive future growth and value creation for shareholders.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Vasundhara Sawalka ",
        "Text": "Microsoft MSFT reported strong growth in its Azure cloud computing segment for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, with revenues increasing 29% (up 30% at cc) year over year, including roughly 8 points from AI services where demand remained higher than available capacity. Intelligent Cloud, which includes Azure, server products and enterprise services, generated a robust $28.5 billion in revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter, marking a 19% year-over-year increase. (Read More: Microsoft Q4 Earnings & Revenues Beat on Cloud Success)The robust growth in Azure comes amid increasing competition in the cloud computing market, particularly from rivals Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud. Microsoft's ability to maintain such significant growth rates in this competitive landscape demonstrates the company's strong market position and effective strategic execution. This performance has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting discussions about whether now is an opportune time to invest in the tech giant.\u00a0We expect cloud services and AI innovations to remain a key growth driver for Microsoft. We believe that the ongoing digital transformation trend, coupled with Microsoft's strong enterprise relationships and comprehensive product ecosystem, positions the company for continued success. For the fiscal first-quarter 2025, Microsoft expects Intelligent Cloud revenues between $28.6 billion and $28.9 billion. In Azure, MSFT expects revenue growth at cc between 28% and 29%.Shares of MSFT have returned 10.9% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 17.2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft presents a strong investment case with its dominant position in cloud computing (Azure) and productivity software (Office 365), driving consistent revenue growth. Microsoft continues to solidify its position as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, offering an unparalleled diversity of AI accelerators. The company's strategic partnership with OpenAI remains the cornerstone of its AI innovation, with Azure OpenAI Service providing access to frontier models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini.The tech giant's AI offerings are gaining traction across industries, with companies like H&R Block, Suzuki and Telstra leveraging these advanced technologies. Microsoft's Phi-3, a family of powerful small language models, has attracted high-profile clients, including BlackRock and Emirates.Microsoft's Models as a Service has seen significant growth, with the number of paid customers more than doubling quarter over quarter. This service simplifies the use of large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) for developers, attracting clients from diverse sectors.Azure AI, Microsoft's app server for the AI wave, continues to expand its customer base, growing nearly 60% year over year to more than 60,000 clients. The company is also making strides in cloud migration, with Azure Arc customers increasing 90% year over year.Microsoft's dominance extends to enterprise solutions, as it remains the preferred cloud provider for SAP and Oracle workloads. The company's next-generation analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric, has gained over 14,000 paid customers, showcasing a 20% quarter-over-quarter increase.As Microsoft continues to innovate and expand its AI and cloud offerings, it cements its position as a frontrunner in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $277.25 billion, indicating 13.1% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.17, indicating 10.8% growth year over year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft's Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool, is making significant strides across various sectors, transforming how organizations operate. GitHub Copilot, now adopted by over 77,000 organizations, including BBVA and FedEx, has seen 180% year-over-year growth. It is a key driver of GitHub's revenues, which have reached a $2 billion annual run rate.The integration of generative AI into Microsoft's Power Platform has enabled over 480,000 organizations to leverage AI capabilities, with the platform's monthly active users growing 40% year over year to 48 million. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is rapidly becoming indispensable for knowledge workers, with its daily users nearly doubling quarter over quarter.Microsoft is extending Copilot's reach into specific industries, notably healthcare. DAX Copilot, adopted by over 400 healthcare organizations, has seen a 40% quarter-over-quarter increase in purchases. In the security sector, Copilot for Security has attracted over 1,000 paid customers.The impact of Copilot extends to consumer engagement as well, with users creating over 12 billion images and conducting 13 billion chats to date, marking a 150% increase since the start of the calendar year.As Microsoft continues to innovate and expand Copilot's capabilities, it's clear that AI-driven productivity tools are becoming increasingly central to modern business operations.\nMicrosoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S of 11X exceeding both the industry average of 7.99X and its own historical median of 10.06X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about the potential limitations. Investors must carefully weigh Microsoft's market strength and growth prospects against the risks associated with its high valuation. The key consideration is whether the company's performance and potential can justify this premium pricing in the long term.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft's strong performance in Azure cloud and AI offerings is expected to drive substantial growth in the near term despite a premium valuation and fierce competition in the cloud market. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, AI integration and innovative product development have positioned it favorably in the competitive market. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present.

On that day, Microsoft is projected to report earnings of $3.09 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 3.34%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $64.45 billion, showing a 14.04% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nMSFT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $13.04 per share and revenue of $277.39 billion.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Microsoft (MSFT). Shares have lost about 1.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Microsoft due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nMicrosoft reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings of $2.95 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.72% and improved 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. At constant currency (cc), earnings increased 11% year over year.Revenues of $64.7 billion increased 15.2% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.84%.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- The recent outage on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s cloud-computer platform demonstrated the persistence of an older, blunt-force style of cyberattack.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinger Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice\nNew York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\nThe 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk\nParis Spent \u20ac1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked?\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\nIt\u2019s called a distributed denial-of-service attack, DDoS for short, and it works by directing massive amounts of junk internet traffic at a target, like a website or server, to disrupt it or even knock it offline. It\u2019s become a favorite tool of hacktivists seeking to make a statement by targeting government institutions, banks or major companies.\nThe attack on Microsoft started Tuesday morning, hours before the technology giant was scheduled to announce quarterly earnings. Customers of its Azure cloud platform faced outages for hours. Mobile ordering at Starbucks Corp. was down, as were certain online services from the UK government\u2019s courts and tribunals service and the Dutch football club FC Twente. Microsoft 365, which includes popular applications like Outlook and Excel, was also impacted.\nTo make matters worse, an error in Microsoft\u2019s automated defense mechanism \u201camplified\u201d the attack instead of mitigating it, the company said in a status update.\nDDoS attacks were once considered a \u201csolved problem,\u201d according to Boaz Gelbord, chief security officer at Akamai Technologies Inc. \u201cAttackers could clog the pipes, and then providers could buy bigger pipes, and then they\u2019d be safe from DDoS.\u201d\nBut today, they are cheaper and easier than ever and can even be purchased on the dark web for as little as $11, according to Akamai.\n\u201cOne of the phenomena we\u2019ve seen in recent years is DDoS attacks resurging,\u201d Gelbord said.\u201cThey\u2019re a problem for small sites, but especially now for enterprise companies. It used to be the opposite.\u201d\nDDoS attacks, which have been around for decades, aim to flood web servers with so much traffic that they become virtually inaccessible to legitimate users. The proliferation of internet-connected devices has helped intensify the attacks. Specialized malware is used to infect everything from smart TVs and fitness trackers to baby monitors and video cameras. The malware weaves those infected devices into a single network known as a \u201cbotnet,\u201d a zombie army that can be directed to overwhelm servers with millions of requests at once.\nAside from making political statements, DDoS attacks are sometimes part of broader extortion schemes in which hackers seek a payment to make them stop. It\u2019s not yet clear who was behind the Microsoft attacks.\nDDoS mitigation efforts often involve filtering out malicious traffic. However, requests from bots \u2014 those zombie computers \u2014 can look nearly identical to requests from real users, said Pavel Odintsov, chief technology officer of DDoS-mitigation company FastNetMon. Odintsov and five other DDoS experts told Bloomberg News that Microsoft likely exacerbated the impacts of Tuesday\u2019s attack by blocking out real Azure users in its attempt to isolate illegitimate ones.\nA Microsoft spokesperson said \u201ca network device misconfiguration\u201d contributed to the service interruption, but didn\u2019t provide further details. The company is still investigating the Azure outage, which has now been fully resolved, the spokesperson said.\n\u201cWhen you have a hammer, everything is a nail,\u201d Odintsov said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to make a mistake and block real customers.\u201d Over the past four years, Odintsov said, the number of DDoS attacks his company has observed has approximately doubled each year.\nDDoS attacks are getting tougher to defend against, Gelbord said, because botnets are getting bigger and more accessible. With an ever-increasing number of web-connected devices and gadgets, cybercriminals have more potential electronic devices to enlist as unwitting participants in their attacks. \u201cYou have much more readily available botnet armies,\u201d Gelbord said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an industry. You can rent them for hire, fairly inexpensively.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, jointly warned of potential DDoS attacks during the upcoming 2024 US presidential election. The attacks have been used in the past to target election infrastructure, and the government agencies said they will likely be used again for the same purpose.\nIn Venezuela, DDoS attacks have spiked tenfold since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared victory in a disputed election, according to NetScout Systems Inc. Political demonstrations have erupted on the streets of Caracas to protest what some are calling a fraudulent win.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a specific hacktivist group, but a form of digital protest to real-world events,\u201d said Richard Hummel, a senior threat intelligence manager at NetScout. \u201cThis is cyberactivity where adversaries are trying to effect chaos.\u201d\n--With assistance from Charles Gorrivan.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\nForty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest\nThe Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.\n\u201cNow that positions have been unwound, there\u2019s an opportunity for traders to take positions,\u201d Sluymer reportedly said.\nMany others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC.\n\u201cIf you look at what we\u2019ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it\u2019s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it\u2019s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,\u201d Ives said.\nFor this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNorthfoto / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives recently said in a note that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) latest results should be enough to allay the market\u2019s concerns about AI monetization.\n\u201cOver the last few weeks, we have also seen an acceleration of enterprises and CIOs from our customer/partner conversations heading down the strategic AI path, which all comes down to use cases and ROI for these budget dollars,\u201d analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note.\nIves thinks the results from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and a few other companies \u201cgave more credence to the AI monetization phase.\u201d\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company\u2019s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and will bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top absolute contributors were Alphabet,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.

        "Text": "Microsoft on Tuesday blamed Delta Air Lines for its weeklong bout of cancelations last month, claiming its aging technology caused the airline to recover far slower from the global tech outage than its rivals. Microsoft also claimed Delta turned down help after the CrowdStrike bug led to \u201cblue screens of death\u201d on Windows devices.\nMicrosoft, CrowdStrike and Delta have been in a war of words since the airline hired a high-profile attorney to seek compensation from Microsoft and CrowdStrike.\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian lashed out at CrowdStrike in a CNBC interview last week and said the computer problems cost Delta $500 million. CrowdStrike\u2019s flawed software update caused widespread computer outages on July 19 at Delta and hundreds of other companies around the globe.\nCrowdStrike then fired back on Sunday, saying the airline had refused offers of help to get through the outage faster.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft joined in. In a letter by attorney Mark Cheffo, the tech company said that even though Microsoft\u2019s software did not cause the outage, it \u201cimmediately jumped in and offered to assist Delta at no charge.\u201d Microsoft employees asked Delta if they needed assistance every day from July 19 to 23, the letter said.\n\u201cOn the morning of July 22, a Microsoft employee, aware that Delta was having more difficulty recovering than any other airline, messaged a Delta employee to say, \u2018just checking in and no pressure to reply, but if you can think of anything your Microsoft team can be helping with today, just say the word.\u2019\u201d\nThe letter continued. \u201cThe Delta employee replied, saying \u2018all good. Cool will let you know and thank you.\u2019\u201d\nBut meanwhile, the computer problems at Delta knocked its crucial crew tracking system offline for the better part of a week, making it impossible for the company to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its aircraft. While other airlines were quick to resume normal operations after the CrowdStrike outage, Delta was forced to cancel about 30% of its schedule over those five days, leaving an estimated half-million passengers stranded. It took many days after that to re-book affected passengers on other flights and return their checked bags.\nOn July 24, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emailed Bastian as well, according to the letter.\n\u201cIn fact, it is rapidly becoming apparent that Delta likely refused Microsoft\u2019s help because the IT system it was most having trouble restoring\u2014its crew-tracking and scheduling system\u2014was being serviced by other technology providers, such as IBM, because it runs on those providers\u2019 systems, and not Microsoft Windows or Azure,\u201d the letter said.\nMicrosoft said a preliminary review suggested Delta hasn\u2019t \u201cmodernized its IT infrastructure\u201d though its competitors have.\n\u201cDelta has a long track record of investing in safe, reliable and elevated service for our customers and employees. Since 2016, Delta has invested billions of dollars in IT capital expenditures, in addition to the billions spent annually in IT operating costs,\u201d a Delta spokesperson said.\nLast week, Bastian claimed CrowdStrike was nowhere to be found during the meltdown.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t offered us anything. Free consulting advice to help us,\u201d said the Delta CEO in an interview on CNBC.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have priority access to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you\u2019ve got to test this stuff,\u201d Bastian said. \u201cYou can\u2019t come into a mission critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nA person familiar with its actions confirmed to CNN that Delta had hired the law firm of high-profile attorney David Boies to pursue compensation from Microsoft and CrowdStrike.\n\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d Bastian told CNBC. \u201cWe have to protect our shareholders, we have to protect our customers (and) our employees for the damage, not just the cost but the reputational damage.\u201d\nOn Monday, CrowdStrike\u2019s legal counsel sent a letter to Delta\u2019s legal counsel, saying it was \u201chighly disappointed by Delta\u2019s suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed willful misconduct.\u201d\nLike Microsoft, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz offered onsite assistance personally to Delta CEO Ed Bastian but received no response, the letter said, adding that Delta later told CrowdStrike no help was needed.\nDelta\u2019s public litigation threat \u201ccontributed to a misleading narrative that CrowdStrike is responsible for Delta\u2019s IT decisions and response to the outage,\u201d attorney Michael Carlinsky wrote in the letter, \u201cShould Delta pursue this path, Delta will have to explain to the public, its shareholders, and ultimately a jury why CrowdStrike took responsibility for its actions\u2014swiftly, transparently, and constructively\u2014while Delta did not.\u201d\nThe letter also said Delta would have to explain \u201cresiliency capabilities of Delta\u2019s IT infrastructure.\u201d\nDelta has not yet filed a lawsuit against Microsoft or CrowdStrike.\nIn a statement, a CrowdStrike spokesperson said the letter speaks for itself.\n\u201cWe have expressed our regret and apologies to all of our customers for this incident and the disruption that resulted. Public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike as a long-time partner is not constructive to any party. We hope that Delta will agree to work cooperatively to find a resolution,\u201d a CrowdStrike spokesperson said.\nCNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Microsoft vs. Apple",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been tech archrivals for roughly 40 years, since the dawn of the personal computer.\nThe two companies have different routes to dominance of the tech industry. Microsoft has largely climbed the ladder through its ubiquitous Windows operating system, dominance of enterprise software, and, more recently, its strength in cloud infrastructure. Apple, meanwhile, has reached a market cap of $3 trillion, largely through the popularity of its consumer electronics devices such as the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and others.\nIn 2024, the two tech titans are set to butt heads again. Let's take a look at how each company is positioning itself as the next transformative technology, generative AI, takes hold.\nMicrosoft emerged as an early leader in artificial intelligence largely because of its partnership of OpenAI, the AI start-up behind ChatGPT. Microsoft has invested an estimated $13 billion in OpenAI, and that has enabled it to leverage OpenAI's technology across a wide range of products, including Azure OpenAi, its CoPilot AI assistant, and its GitHub code repository.\nMicrosoft is already gaining traction with AI-infused products in a way that few other companies are. For example, Microsoft now has 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year, and spend per customer continues to grow as well. Azure AI also seems to be a key reason it's gaining market share on Amazon Web Services, generally considered the leader in cloud infrastructure.\nAI is also contributing to products like Microsoft, its next-generation data platform, which has more than 14,000 paid customers.\nLooking ahead, Microsoft also has a broader reach than any of its tech rivals in the \"Magnificent Seven\" with AI and with an assistant like Copilot. That's because it can extend Copilot to a wide range of products, including Microsoft Office, other consumer-facing products like Linkedin, and the Github code repository. It also has more direct relationships with enterprise customers than its peers, giving it a ready market for AI tools.\nThus far, Microsoft has played its hand its well, and CEO Satya Nadella is clearly willing to do what it takes to make Microsoft an AI leader.\nApple has taken a much slower approach to AI than Microsoft, and for a long time Apple was criticized for a seeming lack of AI strategy. However, the tech giant flipped the script when it unveiled Apple Intelligence in June, showing off a suite of tech tools like writing assistants and image generation that will soon be embedded in iPhones and other Apple devices.\nWith that move, Apple's hammered home the underlying strength of its business, which is that it's much easier to deploy new technology or new software to consumers when you own the hardware, and one of its greatest competitive advantages is its installed base of more than 2 billion devices.\nIn other words, if you own an iPhone or another Apple device, you'll be likely to use Apple Intelligence because you'll be directly exposed to it and it will be free on your phone. In this sense, Apple has a much different business model, and arguably a better one, than any other tech giant in AI because it can use the technology to drive sales and higher prices of its iPhones, which are already overwhelmingly popular.\nApple Intelligence isn't widely available yet, and its next iteration of phones, the iPhone 16, will go on sale next month. Sales of those devices will be the best early indication of Apple's potential in AI.\nThese two companies could end up dominating AI, the way they have the last generation of technology from two different angles, but for now Microsoft seems to have the upper hand.\nIts partnership with OpenAI looks like a coup at this point as that $13 billion investment has paid off enormously in the company's surge in market cap and its head start over rivals. OpenAI also appears to be the technological leader in generative AI as it set the tone for the new era by launching ChatGPT.\nApple could emerge as a force as well with Apple Intelligence, but for now, Microsoft is the safer AI stock to own and the better of the two.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Exclusive: Microsoft-backed Space and Time raises $20 million to merge AI and blockchain",
        "Author": "  Leo Schwartz ",
        "Text": "As AI continues its dominance of corporate attention\u2014and venture capital investment\u2014the once-beloved sector of blockchain has sometimes felt like a spurned child. Still, many crypto proponents argue that blockchain can still solve the most pressing problems posed by AI, from confirming personhood to preventing deepfakes. That's why one startup, Space and Time, is building software to bring the immutability of blockchain to AI applications\u2014and it will have ample resources to build out its vision, with a $20 million Series A led by the crypto-focused venture firms Framework Ventures, Lightspeed Faction, Arrington Capital, and Hivemind Capital.\nSpace and Time previously raised an earlier $20 million led by Microsoft's M12 Ventures, which also participated in the Series A, in September 2022.\n\"[We're] moving to an AI-powered world, meaning you don't know what is being generated by AI and what is being generated by a person or corporations,\" Nate Holiday, the cofounder and CEO of Space and Time, told Fortune in an interview. \"We think it's super critical to sit right in the middle of this to ensure that as applications are being built in this new world, powered by Space and Time, you have this verifiability, trust, and transparency.\"\nSpace and Time's pitch is simple, at least in technological terms. The promise of crypto is that data can be coded directly onto blockchains without the need for intermediaries, meaning it cannot be tampered with or misinterpreted, as long as you know how to interact with it and what to look for. When you send a transaction from one Bitcoin wallet holder to another, there does not need to be a bank or broker sitting in the middle who might misrepresent what happened.\nAI, in many instances, is the polar opposite. The applications we have become used to, such as ChatGPT, are black boxes\u2014we ask them a question and get an output, but receive almost no insight into the process and have no way of finding out. This means that, when the answer is incorrect, there is no way of understanding how the agent came up with the would-be solution.\nOn a high level, Space and Time is tackling that thorny issue of verifiability. Its technology aspires to ensure that when an AI application provides an output, you can confirm where it came from and, ideally, that it's correct. Holiday argues the way to do that is through blockchain, which is essentially just a type of database that is theoretically more immune from human meddling.\nInitially, Space and Time pitched its solution just to blockchain firms, positioning itself as a kind of decentralized version of the data storage service Snowflake. In other words, it would serve as a data warehouse, but unlike other crypto-native solutions such as Filecoin, Space and Time would be designed to allow applications to retrieve and access data quickly. That plan proved appealing to companies building in the world of DeFi, which revolves around financial platforms that must store massive amounts of user information that require constant updates, such as lending apps.\nMichael Anderson, the cofounder of Framework Ventures, said the Web3 Snowflake analog is what initially drew him to Space and Time, as he realized the use cases could be expanded. He said the idea now is to take the advantages of blockchain verifiability and apply it to non-blockchain-based applications, like traditional financial institutions, which can use blockchain-native tools (namely ZK proofs) to cross-reference third-party data, such as personally identifiable information (PII). For example, if banks and DMVs integrated with Snowflake, Space and Time could help the banks use DMV data to verify someone's age without having to store the data themselves.\nAI represents the next frontier. As AI agents begin to complete tasks for us on the internet, such as booking flights, they will need to be able to transact programmatically with rules around using credit cards or verifying that data is accurate. In this future world, Space and Time wants to be the blockchain-native database that new applications, and the AI agents that interact with them, rely on.\nOf course, with crypto and AI still both in nascent phases, a lot has to go right for this type of technology to achieve widespread adoption. Still, Space and Time is making enough progress to draw investment from some of the top blockchain venture funds, as well as Microsoft, which is aiming to compete with other so-called hyperscalers like Google and Amazon. Along with its database solutions, Space and Time is also using Microsoft's generative AI products to build blockchain app development tools available to its customers.\n\"[Space and Time] has real people building real technology, which especially in the blockchain x AI space, is harder to find,\" said Anderson. \"When you see entrepreneurs like them coming in, it makes you excited about blockchain.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella also personally emailed Delta CEO Ed Bastian and never heard back.\n\u201cEven though Microsoft\u2019s software had not caused the CrowdStrike incident, Microsoft immediately jumped in and offered to assist Delta at no charge,\u201d according to the letter, which was signed by Mark Cheffo of Dechert LLP.\nThe claims, in response to Delta\u2019s hiring of attorney David Boies, heighten the tension after Delta suggested it would try to seek compensation for a breakdown it expects to cost it $500 million this quarter. The airline was slower to recover than competitors after an errant software update from CrowdStrike affected Microsoft systems, creating a cascading effect that led Delta to cancel thousands of flights over several days.\nBastian has criticized both CrowdStrike and Microsoft over the outage, telling CNBC in an interview last week that Microsoft is \u201cprobably the most fragile platform within that space\u201d when it comes to large technology providers.\nDelta\u2019s extended recovery time stemmed from the outage\u2019s effects on an internal system used to process changes to flights and their crews. That left Delta unable to get its aircraft and personnel properly aligned.\nIn its letter, Microsoft said those systems don\u2019t use its Windows or Azure products and a review suggests that \u201cDelta, unlike its competitors, apparently has not modernized its IT infrastructure.\u201d\nDelta said in an emailed statement Tuesday that it \u201chas a long record of investing in safe, reliable and elevated service for our customers and employees.\u201d The airline said it has invested billions of dollars since 2016 in capital spending and annual operating costs related to IT.\nThe US Department of Transportation has opened an investigation into Delta\u2019s handling of the breakdown and the airline could face a fine from the agency depending on its conclusions. Southwest Airlines Co. was fined $140 million by DOT in 2023 after a meltdown of its operation in late December 2022 stranded more than 2 million passengers.\nMicrosoft\u2019s rebuttal comes after CrowdStrike said in a similar letter Sunday that Delta refused offers for assistance.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other American stocks.\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a major big tech name. While it initially gained fame for its Windows and Office products, the company has since diversified its product and service offerings to include a cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service.\nConsidering Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading role in both cloud computing and AI, investors in the stock have experienced immense growth in their portfolios. This is particularly because of the growth of Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI products, most notably Azure OpenAI, which is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100. Another AI product developed by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), GitHub Copilot, now has about 1.8 million paid subscribers, which is also significantly contributing to Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings growth. Considering these factors, investors are picking up Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) more enthusiastically than ever.\nA total of 279 hedge funds held stakes in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $89.1 billion.\nBaron Funds mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its second quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other big data stocks.\nThe global big data market is on a rapid growth trajectory, projected to reach $103 billion by 2027, more than doubling its size from 2018. This explosive growth is driven by the increasing reliance on data to inform business decisions, optimize operations, and unlock new revenue streams. According to Statista, the software segment, in particular, is poised to dominate, accounting for 45% of the market by 2027. Big data, characterized by its massive volume, high velocity, and wide variety, presents both opportunities and challenges. Traditional data processing tools struggle to handle the scale and complexity of modern data sets, which have been expanding rapidly due to the surge in mobile data traffic, cloud computing, and the integration of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These factors have contributed to the rise of big data as a critical asset for businesses across industries. As the data landscape evolves, advanced analytics tools such as predictive analytics and data mining have become essential for extracting valuable insights from vast datasets.\nThe rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a surge in connected devices, generating enormous amounts of data that necessitate advanced big data solutions for effective processing and analysis. Cloud computing enhances the big data market by offering scalable and cost-efficient storage and processing capabilities, enabling businesses to handle large data volumes with ease. Technological advancements in big data are continually enhancing the management and analysis of vast datasets, making these processes more accessible and practical. This progress supports the growing trend of data-driven decision-making, where companies increasingly rely on data insights to make informed choices, optimize operations, and secure a competitive edge. Additionally, big data analytics helps organizations uncover hidden patterns and customer trends, fostering innovation and allowing for the development of products and services that adapt to evolving market demands, underscoring the vital role of big data in today\u2019s competitive landscape.\nInvestment in big data technologies is also driven by stringent data privacy and security regulations. Compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. is becoming mandatory for businesses. These regulations require robust data handling practices, pushing companies to implement advanced big data solutions that ensure data privacy and security. Enhanced measures such as secure storage and data privacy protocols build trust with consumers and stakeholders. Moreover, the need for effective data governance frameworks is accelerating the adoption of sophisticated big data technologies. These solutions facilitate comprehensive data management, including tracking data lineage, maintaining data integrity, and conducting regular audits. Emphasis is placed on integrating encryption, anonymization, and real-time monitoring tools to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Continuous investment in big data technologies is crucial for businesses to meet evolving compliance requirements, thereby driving the market\u2019s growth.\nAccording to a report by Verified Market Reserach, North America is projected to remain a leader in the big data market, driven by key industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In the financial sector, Big Data analytics plays a crucial role for banks, investment firms, and insurance companies by providing deeper insights into customer behavior, detecting fraudulent activities, and evaluating risk. By analyzing extensive data sets, including transaction histories, market trends, and customer demographics, financial institutions can uncover patterns and anomalies that aid in making informed decisions and managing risks. Predictive analytics models further enhance market trend forecasts, optimize investment strategies, and improve portfolio management, contributing to greater profitability and competitive edge in the financial sector.\nIn healthcare, Big Data analytics significantly improves patient care, reduces costs, and advances medical research. Healthcare providers use Big Data to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and genomic data to tailor treatment plans, diagnose diseases with greater precision, and predict patient outcomes. Population health analytics also helps healthcare organizations identify high-risk groups, allocate resources more effectively, and implement preventive measures. Additionally, the integration of big data into healthcare systems supports real-time monitoring of patient health metrics, allowing for timely interventions and better overall outcomes. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from big data by accelerating drug discovery, refining clinical trials, and creating personalized medicines, driving innovation and progress in medical science.\nWith such a robust outlook for the big data market, investors are keenly eyeing companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. In this article, we will explore the best big data stocks to buy now, focusing on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities within this dynamic sector.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 18.22%\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $494.72\nAt number seven on our list of ten best big data stocks to buy now stands Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Analysts have set an average share price target of $494.72 for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), reflecting an anticipated upside of 18.22%. On August 16, BMO Capital Markets has upheld its Outperform rating for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with an unchanged price target of $500. The firm attributes its positive stance to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) strong position in artificial intelligence and its extensive range of products. Although the June quarter showed mixed results and the guidance for Azure is conservative, BMO is optimistic that Azure\u2019s growth will accelerate by late FY25 as the company overcomes current capacity challenges. The firm also emphasized Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) careful capital expenditure management, anticipating that this prudent strategy will be maintained in FY25.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) currently offers a forward dividend yield of 0.72%, with an annual payout of $3.00 per share. The company\u2019s payout ratio stands at 25.40%, indicating a healthy balance between dividend payments and earnings. Over the past five years, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) dividend has grown at an average rate of 10.27% annually, and it has consistently increased its dividend for 19 consecutive years. The most recent dividend, announced at $0.75 per share, has an ex-dividend date of August 15, with a payout date set for September 12.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top absolute contributors were Alphabet,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure\u2019s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 7th on our list of the best big data stock to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Many Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, for US$20m worth of shares, at about US$412 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$403. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\nIn the last year Microsoft insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Microsoft. Specifically, Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff ditched US$11m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, currently worth about US$993m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nAn insider hasn't bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Microsoft is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Microsoft. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Microsoft that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\nBut note: Microsoft may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are very different companies, but they are the top three players in the fast-growing cloud computing industry.\nThey offer hundreds of cloud services to businesses, from simple data storage to complex software development tools. More recently, they have invested heavily in new data centers filled with powerful graphics processors (GPUs) from the likes of Nvidia, and they rent the computing power to artificial intelligence (AI) developers. This could be one of the most valuable opportunities in the history of the cloud industry.\nMicrosoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are locked in a fierce battle for AI market share. DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN), on the other hand, has carved out a lucrative niche by only serving small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs), which are often overlooked by its trillion-dollar competitors. DigitalOcean stock looks like a great value, and here's why investors might want to buy it right now.\nThe cloud leaders typically focus on serving large organizations because they have the highest budgets, whereas SMBs receive less attention. DigitalOcean targets those customers exclusively, whether they are in the start-up phase or they have up to 500 employees.\nDigitalOcean provides them with highly personalized service, clear and transparent pricing, and cloud tools that are simple to deploy, because the company knows most of its customers can't afford in-house technical teams.\nDigitalOcean is now using that blueprint to deliver affordable AI solutions to customers. Right now, cloud leaders let their largest customers access tens of thousands of GPUs worth of computing capacity, which means developers with significant financial resources are building the most advanced AI models. Smaller companies simply can't compete.\nDigitalOcean recently announced it will allow its customers to access small numbers of AI GPUs (typically between one and eight), including Nvidia's flagship H100, to integrate AI into their workflows at a scale that suits them. CEO Paddy Srinivasan says this fractional on-demand access to GPUs is a first of its kind for the industry, and it helps democratize access to AI.\nThe company will also open a new state-of-the-art data center in Atlanta in early 2025 that will expand its AI compute capacity. It adds to the capacity DigitalOcean acquired when it bought Paperspace last year, which is a specialist in delivering AI data center infrastructure at affordable rates.\nIn fact, Paperspace is up to 70% cheaper than cloud leaders like Microsoft Azure when it comes to AI compute capacity, because it offers per-second billing to reduce wastage, and it doesn't lock customers into contracts. Plus, it has a leaner cost structure because it offers a narrow set of services, and it passes those savings on to the customer.\nDigitalOcean generated a record $192.5 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), which was a 13% increase from the year-ago period. It marked the second consecutive quarterly growth acceleration.\nThe company was regularly growing its top line by more than 30% each quarter just two years ago, so it has slowed considerably overall. One reason is that DigitalOcean is currently slashing costs in order to boost its profitability. During Q2, the company had total operating expenses of $95 million, which was an 8.5% reduction from the year-ago period.\nThat resulted in $19.1 million in net income, a whopping 2,777% increase.\nThe fact DigitalOcean managed to accelerate its revenue growth while cutting costs and generating a healthy profit really speaks to the organic demand for its cloud services.\nPlus, here's something investors should keep an eye on in the coming quarters. DigitalOcean said its revenue attributable to AI, specifically, soared by a staggering 200% year over year in Q2. The company didn't disclose how much revenue it actually generated from its AI services (including Paperspace), so we can assume that growth was from a very low baseline number -- but it still signals surging demand.\nAccording to an estimate by Grand View Research, the cloud industry overall will be worth around $730 billion this year. The SMB segment alone could be worth $114 billion according to DigitalOcean, but the company expects it to grow by 23% annually going forward compared to just 21.2% for the cloud industry overall.\nDigitalOcean's strategy to deliver affordable AI infrastructure and services could add a new dimension to that opportunity, because it's penetrating a brand new market that has been underserved by other providers. Global consulting firm PwC thinks AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, so it's easily the largest financial opportunity DigitalOcean has faced to date.\nDigitalOcean stock is currently trading 75% below its all-time high that was set during the tech frenzy in 2021. It was overvalued back then with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of around 30, but the company has grown its revenue consistently ever since, and its P/S ratio now stands at just 4.1.\nThat's more than a 50% discount to its average P/S ratio of 8.8 going back to when the company came public in 2021:\nSimply put, DigitalOcean stock looks like a good value right now. Combine that with the company's accelerating revenue growth, surging profitability, and enormous opportunities in the cloud and AI industries, and investors could do well to start buying.\nBefore you buy stock in DigitalOcean, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and DigitalOcean wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Microsoft Next?",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been around for a long time, so it's no stranger to stock splits. The company split its stock nine times from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But since then? Nada. Today, Microsoft stock is trading at over $400 per share. Cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) growth has driven shares to new heights and could continue over the long term.\nPerhaps it's time for management to consider a stock split.\nWhat does that mean for investors? Would a stock split make Microsoft a buy?\nHere is what you need to know.\nThe media loves making a big deal out of stock splits. But are they as big a deal as they seem?\nFirst, what is a stock split? A stock split is when a company divides its stock to increase the number of shares. Suppose one share of a company's stock trades at $100. If management did a 5-to-1 split, that single share would become five shares trading at $20 each.\nNotice how the value of the investment didn't change. One share at $100 or five at $20 equals the same total. This is very important.\nStock splits divide everything, so each share represents less of the company's revenue, profits, and equity. So, while a stock split creates a lower share price, it's an illusion. The company's fundamental valuation doesn't change.\nSo why split the stock in the first place? In most cases, it's for liquidity. As a share price rises, it's harder for investors to accumulate shares without having a lot of money. Employees who have earned stock-based compensation might be sitting on significant gains and may not want to sell at high dollar increments. A higher share count and lower share price make it easier for investors and employees to control how much they buy or sell at a time.\nYou can see that Microsoft split several times between the late 1980s and the early 2000s. That was due to remarkable stock performance; Microsoft gained nearly 60,000% from 1986 to 2000, just before the Dot-Com market crash. Microsoft's stock plunged in the crash and took 17 years to reach the price it traded at in 2000. That's why Microsoft has only split once since 2000.\nMicrosoft launched its cloud platform Azure in early 2010, sparking a new era for the company. Since then, Microsoft's stock has appreciated 1,400%, and the cloud is its largest and fastest-growing business unit today. A new generation of employees who have been with the company over the years are likely sitting on hefty stock gains.\nAzure is already the world's second-leading cloud platform. Microsoft's partnership with leading AI developer OpenAI is poised to funnel AI computing workloads through Azure as companies adopt AI over the coming years.\nMicrosoft recently reported fourth-quarter earnings for its fiscal year 2024 and topped Wall Street's expectations, fueled by solid momentum in its cloud and gaming businesses. Today, Microsoft stock trades at 32 times its estimated 2025 earnings. Analysts believe earnings per share will grow at an annualized 16% rate for the next three to five years.\nSince stock splits don't fundamentally change the stock, investors should never make an investment decision based solely on a stock split. A price-to-earnings ratio double the company's earnings growth percentage isn't cheap, but Microsoft arguably offers a unique combination of quality and upside that's hard to replicate.\nLong-term investors may be willing to pay a slight premium to own the stock now, though market volatility could easily present better buying opportunities.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Microsoft with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Microsoft managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Microsoft shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 42% to 45%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Microsoft's future EPS 100% free.\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$3.1t company like Microsoft. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.03% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.\nOne positive for Microsoft is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Microsoft by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Martin Baccardax ",
        "Text": "Updated at 10:46 AM EDT\nMicrosoft shares edged lower in early Friday trading, but remain on pace for a solid weekly gain, after a top Wall Street analyst revisited the tech giant's rating and price target following its muted quarterly earnings earlier this month.\nMicrosoft\u00a0 (MSFT) , which has been the second-worst performer of the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks so far this year, disappointed Wall Street with plans to expand its capital spending on AI infrastructure even as growth in its flagship cloud division continued to moderate.\nThe group's Azure cloud division, its biggest growth driver, posted revenue growth of 29% for the three months ended in June,\u00a0 just shy of Wall Street's 30% forecast. Overall Intelligent Cloud revenue rose 19% to $28.52 billion, also narrowly missing Wall Street's $25.8 billion consensus forecast.\nMicrosoft noted, however, that around 8 percentage points of Azure growth came from AI investments, larger than the 7 percentage point boost from the prior quarter.\nCapital spending for the quarter rose 77.6% from a year earlier to $19 billion, well ahead of the $14 billion tallied over the three months ended in March, taking its fiscal year total to $55.7 billion.\nMicrosoft, which normally guides investors on a quarterly basis, said Azure growth would accelerate over its fiscal second half, which ends next June, with growth for the three months ending in September similar to that of the previous quarter.\nImage source: Brad Barket/Getty\nBMO analyst Keith Bachman, who reiterated his 'overweight' rating and $500 price target on Microsoft in a note published Friday, said the longer-view outlook reflects a bullish vision of AI demand.\n\"We think the reason management provided guidance beyond the traditional one-quarter look-ahead is due to anticipated easing of capacity constraints and a robust demand/pipeline,\" Bachman said\n\"In other words, we believe management has visibility into improved aggregate capacity to enable better growth in the second half of the financial year,\" he added.\nBachman, who lists Microsoft as a 'top pick' for the bank alongside cloud software group SAP\u00a0 (SAP) , says capacity constraints have held back Azure's growth, but he sees that easing over the fiscal second half.\nRelated: Microsoft stock tumbles after key segment disappoints\nOn the subject of capital spending, Bachman said that meetings with Microsoft management suggest around half its 2024 capex was focused on\u00a0\"long-life assets such as land and buildings, and half was for shorter-life assets such as graphics-processing units and servers. The vast majority of capital expenditures were focused on cloud infrastructure.\"\n\"Microsoft needs to invest ahead of demand, and in some cases, years ahead of demand,\" when it comes to buildings and land, he argued, \"whereas purchases of servers, racks, and routers can be made closer to when demand arises.\"\nThe group's annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated Microsoft would likely spend around $35 billion on data-center construction costs, with most coming in the current fiscal year, more than double the $13.5 billion tally from the prior fiscal year.\nRelated: Microsoft exec warns of an ongoing problem\n\"As consensus capex forecasts increase by more than consensus Azure revenue forecasts, the simple arithmetic looks worse in the short-run for Microsoft's cloud business,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Jackson Ader said in a recent client note.\nMore AI Stocks:\nNvidia stock tumbles in tech slump amid questions over key chip\nMicrosoft exec warns of an ongoing problem\nApple earnings top forecasts, iPhone sales slip ahead of AI launch\n\"We remain below consensus on capital expenditures in the coming years, with [Wall Street] now looking for capex of $67 billion and $82 billion in the next two calendar years,\" said Ader, who carries a $490 price target with an 'overweight' rating on Microsoft.\nBMO's Bachman said Microsoft's capex mix would remain \"relatively consistent\" this year, adding that\u00a0\"long-life capex will not increase linearly with demand and may become less of a burden over time.\"\nMicrosoft shares were marked 0.75% lower in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $417.86 each, a move that would trim the stock's 2024 gain to around 13%.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks\n"

        "Text": "Most artificial intelligence (AI) development happens in the cloud, with the help of tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate centralized data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia, and they rent the computing power to developers who use it to create AI applications.\nPlus, developers can access ready-made large language models on Azure and AWS, including those from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic, to accelerate their progress.\nAWS is the largest provider of cloud services and infrastructure in the world, followed by Azure in second place. However, Azure grew its revenue by 29% in the most recent quarter (ended June 30), with eight percentage points attributed to AI alone. AWS only grew its revenue by 19% during the same period, and the gap, while narrowing, has been a consistent theme:\nMicrosoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure brings in, but it recently said the cloud platform was responsible for about half of its \"Microsoft Cloud\" revenue. During the latest quarter, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in revenue, implying Azure probably generated around $18.4 billion.\nThat means it has a way to go to catch AWS, which generated $26.3 billion in revenue during its latest quarter. But with the current 10% growth differential, Azure could overtake AWS within five years -- and possibly even sooner if the growth gap widens to where it was earlier this year.\nMicrosoft became an early mover in the AI race when it agreed to invest $10 billion in OpenAI in 2023. The start-up's latest GPT-4o models are among the best in the industry, and they are now available on Azure. That could be a key consideration for developers when selecting a cloud provider.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Investors have expressed concerns about the high capex of the tech giant on AI infrastructure over the past few months. Multiple factors have contributed to this. For example, the company recently failed to meet expectations on cloud growth and gross margins. With revenues from AI failing to fill the gap, there was lots of chatter about the near-term consequences of the high capex. In addition, as chipmakers enter into annual cycles of updates - these chips form the bulk of capex spending on AI - there is a fear that the chip architecture developed by tech giants might become obsolete as newer chip versions are launched, thereby rendering their investments useless within a few years.\nHowever, Wall Street remains as bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as ever. Evercore has an Outperform rating on the shares with a price target of $500. In a recent investor note, analyst Kirk Materne said that Microsoft remains well positioned to deliver durable top-and-bottom-line growth and investors should use any pronounced weakness as a buying opportunity for the long-term.\nOverall MSFT ranks 6th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other technology stocks.\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI.\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an \u201cAI bubble\u201d. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index\u2019s steepest three-week slide in two years.\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here\u2019s a glimpse of the article:\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.\u201d\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn\u2019t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a \u201cPsychological Rotation\u201d. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) started as a Windows operating system, after 40 years it is renowned for its cloud computing, Office productivity suite, gaming, advertisement, and taking significant leaps in artificial intelligence.\nIt is one of the best technology stocks and was held by 279 hedge funds in Q2 2024, with total stakes worth $89.07 billion. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $15.59 billion.\nThe fiscal Q4 2024 was a success for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company grew its revenue by 15% to reach $64.7 billion. Revenue growth was boosted by exceptional performance across the board. Azure and other cloud service segments was the top contender with its segment revenues growing 30% during the year.\nRobust revenue growth boosted the net income to $22.0 billion, increasing 10% year-over-year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) leverages its strategic edge of being a highly profitable company. We have already seen how its revenues and net income increased across the board. In addition, the company also improved its operating income by 24% year-over-year to reach $109.4 billion again advocating its profitability. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also pays a dividend to its investors. It has a payout ratio of 25.40% and a 5-year growth rate of 10%.\nShould you invest in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)?\nWe have already seen how the company posted impressive growth figures during its recent quarter. To get a long-term perspective, if you look at the past 10-year performance the company has grown its revenue by 11%, net income by 15%, and levered free cash flow by 9%. This topped with its quarterly results makes MSFT an attractive investment opportunity for growth investors.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Microsoft inks $10 billion green energy deal as power-hungry AI forces its hand to meet emissions commitments",
        "Author": "  Dylan Sloan ",
        "Text": "In 2020, Microsoft made a splashy pledge to be carbon negative by 2030. By purchasing carbon offsets and, crucially, cutting its own emissions, the tech giant committed to not just be a net positive for the climate but to \u201cremove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975.\u201d\nThen came AI.\nAI is already consuming monstrous amounts of electricity, changing the equation for tech firms balancing the twin priorities of managing carbon emissions while staying competitive in the AI race. The data centers that store information and host the large language models that AI is trained on are stocked with high-powered computer chips that require lots of energy and lots of water to cool.\nRead more: I sold a $1.4B big-data startup to IBM\u2014then founded a nature sanctuary. Here are the dangers of AI energy consumption\nSome analysts predict AI could consume as much as a quarter of all power in the U.S. by 2030. Microsoft disclosed last September that its water usage had spiked 34%. The power grid as it currently exists isn\u2019t capable of handling such a massive surge in demand, so tech companies are taking matters into their own hands.\nThis morning, Microsoft announced a $10 billion deal with asset manager Brookfield to supply Microsoft with a whopping 10.5 gigawatts of renewable power capacity between 2026 and 2030. That\u2019s by far the biggest such deal ever signed, roughly equivalent to the amount of electricity required to power 4 million homes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a magnitude of difference,\u201d Xavier Smith, director of research, energy, and industrials at research firm AlphaSense, told Fortune. \u201cEnergy firms \u2026 used to be excited about a four-megawatt deal. Then they turned into 600-megawatt deals. And then now we\u2019re in the gigawatts. It\u2019s growing at this exponential rate.\u201d\nBrookfield is a giant in the renewable energy space. It manages over 7,000 power generating facilities across five continents, from wind farms to solar to hydropower. But even Brookfield will likely need to build up more capacity to meet Microsoft\u2019s demands.\nThat could come in the form of more solar projects, which could be a good fit given potential Sunbelt solar sites\u2019 proximity to growing data-center hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas. And nuclear has emerged as another possible option for the tech sector: Amazon bought a nuclear-powered data-center site in Pennsylvania last month, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has backed a startup that seeks to power data centers with small nuclear reactors.\n\u201cNuclear is increasingly becoming an important part of this conversation,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBack in the fall of last year, [Microsoft] had a job posting for a nuclear technology manager. They want someone to be able to develop a strategy for implementing small modular reactors for them. And so increasingly, nuclear is what people are thinking in terms of this space going forward.\u201d\nNeither company specified what types of renewable power Brookfield would provide Microsoft with, or the precise financial terms of the agreement. The Financial Times estimated the deal was worth around $10.5 billion, based on current industry trends and pricing structures.\nRenewable energy prices have fallen significantly in recent years and could continue to do so, but Smith said it still makes sense for companies such as Microsoft to lock in contracts now rather than waiting for the possibility of cheaper power in the future or trying to build their own energy infrastructure. Because AI is scaling up so quickly and energy projects can take years of construction and permitting to go from proposal to completion, tech companies have incentives to move quickly.\n\u201cI actually think they\u2019re smart to lock this in now,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAll the hyper-scalers are pretty much saying that by 2030, they\u2019ll be operating their data centers on 100% green energy \u2026 The fastest way to do that is to work with someone who\u2019s already built out this infrastructure, rather than trying to start from zero and build out yourself because of the lead times in the space.\u201d\nMicrosoft manages more than 300 data centers around the world, which it uses to store information and train the large language models that power chatbots such as ChatGPT and AI applications including Copilot. Because of the distributed nature of AI infrastructure, some have proposed that off-grid, bespoke energy projects directly powering data centers could be a more efficient way of providing electricity for AI. Although it might be cheaper for Microsoft or its competitors to build their own off-grid solutions, Smith said that that\u2019s a less attractive option.\n\u201cWhile [tech companies] want exposure to renewables, they don\u2019t want to be running a power center,\u201d Smith said. \u201cGoogle doesn\u2019t want to run a power [plant]. Microsoft doesn\u2019t want to run a nuclear facility.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Rajesh Kumar Singh ",
        "Text": "By Rajesh Kumar Singh\nCHICAGO (Reuters) -Microsoft blamed Delta Air Lines on Tuesday for its dayslong struggle to recover from a global cyber outage that led it to cancel more than 6,000 flights.\nA software update last month by global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike triggered system problems for Microsoft customers, including many airlines. But disruptions subsided the next day at other major U.S. carriers while persisting at Delta.\nMicrosoft said its preliminary review suggested that Delta, unlike its competitors, apparently had not modernized its IT infrastructure.\nDelta, however, said it has invested billions of dollars in IT capital expenditures since 2016, in addition to the billions it spends every year in IT operating costs.\n\"Delta has a long track record of investing in safe, reliable and elevated service for our customers and employees,\" a company spokesperson said.\nThe flight disruptions stranded hundreds of thousands of travelers and are estimated to cost the Atlanta-based airline $500 million. Delta is also facing an investigation from the U.S. Transportation Department for the disruptions.\nIt has hired prominent litigator David Boies of Boies Schiller Flexner, known for high-stakes business cases, to seek damages from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft.\nLast week, Delta's CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC that while the airline heavily relies on the two tech companies, they had failed to deliver an \"exceptional service.\" In the interview, he also said that Microsoft had the \"most fragile platform.\"\nIn a letter, Mark Cheffo, a lawyer for Microsoft, called the airline's comments \"incomplete, false, misleading, and damaging to Microsoft and its reputation.\"\nCheffo said Microsoft's software had not caused the CrowdStrike incident, but the tech giant immediately offered to assist Delta at no charge. Its CEO Satya Nadella emailed Bastian, but never got a reply, he added.\nMicrosoft said its employees repeatedly offered to help Delta following the outage, but the U.S. carrier turned them down. It accused the airline of using services of other technology providers for its crew-tracking and scheduling system and alleged it as a likely reason for declining its help.\nCheffo said Microsoft will \"vigorously\" defend itself if Delta files a lawsuit.\nCrowdStrike has also rejected Delta's claim that it should be blamed for flight disruptions. The cybersecurity firm said its CEO had personally reached out to Bastian to offer onsite assistance, but received no response.\n(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; Additional reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Franklin Paul and Josie Kao)\n"

        "Author": "  Alexei Oreskovic ",
        "Text": "The three giants of the AI valley have spoken. What have we learned?\nNot much\u2014other than the fact that all three (Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta) see no limit to the amount of wealth they\u2019re itching to pump into their AI projects.\nOver the course of three hour-long earnings calls, the only hard numbers about AI that we heard this week related to capital expenditures. The Big Tech trio spent a combined $40.5 billion on the infrastructure, land, and chips that power their AI services during the second quarter. And each company indicated that those numbers will only get bigger next year.\nThe rest of the AI info that was served up\u2014particularly anything related to the revenue side of the ledger\u2014amounted to mostly empty rhetoric.\nLet\u2019s start with Meta. On Wednesday CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was on track to have \u201cthe world\u2019s most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\u201d\nZuck didn\u2019t provide much context to help listeners understand what this feat might mean. Is an AI assistant in the same category as a \u201ccopilot,\u201d the generative AI tool that rival Microsoft is fervently pushing to its customers? Unclear.\nLet\u2019s assume an \u201cAI assistant\u201d is a traditional chatbot, in the same class as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and Google\u2019s Gemini. How does Meta AI stack up? Search around, and you\u2019ll discover that even trying to make an apples-to-oranges comparison is not easy. Google said in May that \u201cover 1 million people have signed up to try Gemini Advanced in just three months,\u201d and on its earnings call last week CEO Sundar Pichai said that Gemini is now used in \u201call six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users\u201d\u2014nice large numbers that don\u2019t really tell us anything. For its part, OpenAI said in May that \u201cevery week, more than a hundred million people use ChatGPT.\u201d\nAll of this suggests that Meta, which now has 3.3 billion daily users across its family of apps, could theoretically declare victory if at year\u2019s end there are 101 million people per week using the AI assistant that it has very conspicuously bolted on to Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. The bar doesn\u2019t appear to be very high.\nAs for when these Meta AI users will lift the company\u2019s top line, Zuckerberg takes a long-term view: Generative AI will not be a meaningful driver of the business for \u201cyears.\u201d Don\u2019t expect generative AI to move the needle next year, or even in 2026, Zuckerberg said\u2014AI revenue in 2025 and 2026 will come from the traditional, behind-the-scenes AI tools that the company uses to improve feed recommendations and advertising, but not from Meta AI.\nSatya Nadella had lots of impressive sounding but similarly hazy data points to share on the Microsoft earnings call, and he unleashed them in a rapid-fire barrage. Azure AI customers increased by more than 60% year over year, with roughly 60,000 customers in total. Microsoft 365 customers increased 60% from the previous quarter, with the majority of enterprise customers \u201ccoming back to purchase more seats.\u201d And the number of customers with more than 10,000 Microsoft seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, we learned, but it was left unspecified if those are all paid seats. (Microsoft confirmed after publication that they were paid seats).\nThe closest Nadella came to dropping a hard number involved GitHub, and the AI \u201ccopilot\u201d that helps computer programmers write code.\nGitHub\u2019s annual revenue \u201crun rate\u201d is now $2 billion, Nadella said. Run rates are a slippery thing, of course\u2014what is the $2 billion run rate extrapolated from: revenue rung up in the most recent quarter? Month? Day? Hour? Nadella didn\u2019t say. But he noted that copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub\u2019s revenue growth this year (note that this revenue growth is not the same thing as the just-mentioned revenue run rate, so that $2 billion number is not relevant). He then said that GitHub copilot is already a larger business than the entirety of GitHub when Microsoft acquired the company back in 2018.\nThere\u2019s no public number for GitHub\u2019s revenue at the time of its acquisition, since it was a private company. But a New York Times article at the time cites analyst estimates that GitHub\u2019s revenue was \u201crunning at $200 million a year.\u201d\nSo there you have it, one somewhat solid data point about AI from the Big Tech earnings reports: GitHub copilot\u2019s revenue is somewhere just north of $200 million a year, and very likely below $400 million (since Nadella would presumably have described the business as \u201cmore than twice the size\u201d if that were the case, right?).\nWall Street analyst notes recapping the earnings are full of commentary about \u201cstrong demand signals\u201d and promising AI uptake. And Meta\u2019s stock is riding high today, following Wednesday\u2019s earnings report, thanks to the enduring strength of its advertising business. But when you look closely at what we actually learned about generative AI, there\u2019s not much there there.\nCorrection: The number of Microsoft 365 copilot customers increased 60% in Q2, rather than doubled. And the number of customers with at least 10,000 enterprise seats more than doubled, as opposed to the total number of enterprise seats being 10,000.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft will host a special cybersecurity event with CrowdStrike next month with plans to discuss how the industry can prevent another massive technical outage like the one that crashed millions of Windows computers in July.\nThe system crash was caused by CrowdStrike sending out a faulty software update, which shut down millions of internet-connected systems, from hospitals to airports. The incident was estimated to cost Fortune 500 companies more than $5 billion. Delta Airlines, seeking damages from CrowdsStrike and Microsoft, estimated they lost more than $500 million in canceled flights as a result of the outage.\nNow CrowdStrike, other cybersecurity firms, and government officials plan to convene in Redmond for the Windows Endpoint Security Ecosystem Summit on September 10 to discuss how to prevent another widespread outage. The shared goal will be to come up with \u201cconcrete steps\u201d to protect joint partners\u2019 infrastructure, Microsoft Vice President of Windows and Devices Aidan Marcuss said in a blog post on Friday.\nThe summit \u201c\u200b\u200bwill lead to next steps in both short- and long-term actions and initiatives to pursue, with improved security and resilience as our collective goal,\u201d Marcuss said.\nOne of the steps up for discussion, a Microsoft executive told CNBC, could include making software updates from companies like CrowdStrike rely more on Windows user mode rather than\u00a0 \u201ckernel\u201d mode, the highest level of control that provides access to the underlying operating system. But the executive\u00a0 said removing kernel access in Windows could only prevent a limited scope of possible issues.\nThough it was a CrowdStrike update that triggered the incident, Microsoft has shared much of the fallout. The summit is a \u201cvery good step for Microsoft,\u201d said Forrester cybersecurity analyst Allie Mellen, because it\u2019s an opportunity for the company to reassure other firms and government officials of its commitment to \u201cequitable kernel access\u201d and safe deployment practices.\n\u201cThis is definitely a very needed summit for Microsoft, especially with key partners,\u201d Mellen said. She\u2019s hoping for transparency about outcomes from the summit, specifically about any changes to how cybersecurity vendors function.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to say that another huge cyber incident won\u2019t happen again, Mellen said the conversations and levels of validation of controls for third-party software that have come about since July are promising.\n\u201cOr, if it does happen again, it will have a much smaller scope of impact than it had during this incident,\u201d Mellen said.\nMicrosoft declined to comment further but said in the post that more updates will come following the event.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft is now holding all employees accountable for security, with a failure to be proactive impacting promotion and pay rise opportunities.\nIn an internal memo obtained by The Verge, Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft\u2019s chief people officer shared that due to security becoming a \"core priority\" for the company, all employees will be expected to prioritise security as it becomes a focus in employee performance review conversations.\nHogan\u2019s memo outlined that employees should not view security as merely a \u201ccheck-the-box compliance exercise\u201d as staff will now be held accountable, with proactive actions concerning security being codified and reviewed.\nUnderscoring the importance of security for the company, Hogan stated: \"When faced with a trade-off, the answer is clear and simple: security above all else.\u201d\nThe memo details that all employees will set the Security Core Priority as a part of their 2025 Connect which will involve regular conversations with managers on employee progress in prioritising security.\nConnect is Microsoft\u2019s term for employee performance conversations and implies that security, alongside the company's other key priorities of diversity and inclusion, is now a requirement for these conversations.\nThe memo is said to emphasise the need for employees to go above and beyond to integrate security into every facet of their work.\nThis ensures, staff will held accountable for actions they take in enhancing or maintain Microsoft's security, with regular opportunities for their efforts to be reviewed and discussed.\nAccording to The Verge, Microsoft\u2019s internal FAQ page implies that if employees fail to prioritise security, it could impact promotions, pay raises and bonuses.\nEmployees will have to record and capture how they have prioritised security in their work, with technical employees having to incorporate security into their design protocols as they begin a project.\nFor a company such as Microsoft, which is integrated operationally in many of the world\u2019s critical systems, being vigilant against cybersecurity must be among its top priorities.\nIn May 2024, the company announced that senior executive compensation will also depend on progress and actions contributing to security.\nThis more recent update, thus doubles down on the security emphasis, by now calling on every member of staff to be proactive in regards to security or risk losing out on promotions.\nHogan reminded employees of Microsoft\u2019s position as a company: \u201cWe are here because our customers trust us, and we must continue to earn their trust every day\u201d.\n\"Microsoft links security protocols to employee promotion, according to internal memo\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

As volatility fears start to settle Amazon AMZN\u00a0and Microsoft MSFT\u00a0are two big tech stocks investors may be eyeing for a rebound.\nDespite giving back much of their lofty gains this year, Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s stock are still up just over +7% in 2024 with both companies recently exceeding their quarterly earnings expectations.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCloud Comparison\nAlthough they have different business models, Amazon and Microsoft compete as cloud providers. In fact, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud provider\u00a0followed by Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud.\nReporting its Q2 results last Thursday, Amazon\u2019s AWS segment sales spiked 18% to $26.28 billion while exceeding estimates of $25.86 billion by 1%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeanwhile, Microsoft reported results for its fiscal fourth quarter last Tuesday with Azure helping the software titan bring in $28.51 billion for its Intelligent Cloud segment. This was a 19% leap from the comparative quarter but slightly missed estimates of $28.66 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGrowth & Outlook\nAmazon\u2019s total sales are now expected to rise 10% in fiscal 2024 and are projected to increase another 11% in FY25 to $704.04 billion. On the bottom line, the e-commerce behemoth's annual earnings are slated to soar 62% this year to $4.70 per share versus EPS of $2.90 in 2023. Even better, FY25 EPS is expected to leap another 24% to $5.84.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPivoting to Microsoft, total sales are projected to be up 13% in its current fiscal 2025 and are forecasted to jump another 13% in FY26 to $314.8 billion. Furthermore, Microsoft\u2019s EPS is expected to rise 10% in FY25 and is slated to expand another 15% in FY26 to $15.04.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation Comparison\nAfter their recent pullbacks Amazon\u2019s stock trades at 34.8X forward earnings with Microsoft at 30.3X. Trading at modest premiums to the S&P 500\u2019s 21.8X forward earnings multiple, Amazon\u2019s stock is at a nice discount to its five-year median of 71.8X with Microsoft slightly beneath its own median of 32X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nAt the moment, Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Text": "Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announce their quarterly results within days of each other. This helps investors compare how the rivals stack up against each other in the highly competitive cloud services market.\nWith all three companies providing quarterly updates over the last two weeks, we know how the \"cloud wars\" are going. To sum things up: Amazon leads, Microsoft disappoints, and Google surges.\nAmazon reported its Q2 results on Aug. 1, 2024. The company entered the quarter as the undisputed king of cloud services, with 31% of the market. It still sits on the throne.\nIn the second quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue jumped 19% year over year to $26.3 billion. The segment generated operating income of $9.3 billion, up from $5.4 billion in the prior-year period. Amazon touted several new customers for AWS in Q2, including Discover Financial Services, Eli Lilly, and artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Perplexity.\nMicrosoft's Azure platform trails behind AWS in second place, with a market share of 25% earlier this year. Azure has been gaining ground, though, especially since Microsoft began integrating GPT-4 into its cloud services offerings in 2023.\nThat trend continued in the latest quarter. Microsoft announced its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results on July 30, 2024. The tech giant reported Azure and other cloud services revenue soared 29% year over year (30% in constant currency).\nWhile this growth was strong, it disappointed Wall Street. Analysts were expecting between 30% and 31% constant-currency revenue growth.\nGoogle Cloud has been a distant third to AWS and Azure. In Q1, it held a market share of 11%. However, Google Cloud's growth has accelerated.\nAlphabet reported its Q2 results on July 23, 2024. Google Cloud revenue surged roughly 29% year over year to a record-high $10.3 billion, with Google Cloud Platform services growing even more. The unit generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating profit in Q2, its first quarter for profits to top $1 billion.\nThere's more to the story than Amazon leading, Microsoft disappointing, and Google surging. All three cloud titans had good news to report in their recent quarterly updates.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the company's Q2 earnings call that \"three macro trends\" continue to drive AWS growth. First, customers are once again focusing on new efforts after completing most of their cost optimization efforts. Second, Jassy said they're \"modernizing their infrastructure and moving on-premise infrastructure to the cloud.\" Third, customers are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI).\nMicrosoft CFO Amy Hood acknowledged that the company faces AI capacity constraints. However, she said in the recent quarterly call that Azure's growth should accelerate in the second half of 2024 as AI capacity expands. The slightly disappointing growth in Q2 could be a blip that's quickly forgotten.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai noted in his company's earnings call, \"We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search.\" He added, \"Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell.\"\nThe Gemini large language models (LLMs) are key to this success. Pichai said that Gemini's support for 2 million tokens is \"the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date\" and \"powers developer use cases that no other model can handle.\"\nWars typically result in one or more parties emerging as the victors and other parties ending up as the vanquished. However, I think with the cloud wars, there will be winners all around.\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet should all have tremendous growth opportunities for years to come with their cloud businesses. All three stocks are great picks for long-term investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

MSFT, Novo Nordisk A/S NVO, Uber Technologies, Inc. UBER, Spok Holdings, Inc. SPOK and Willis Lease Finance Corp. WLFC.\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Novo Nordisk A/S and Uber Technologies, Inc., as well as two micro-cap stocks Spok Holdings, Inc. and Willis Lease Finance Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nMicrosoft\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+13.6% vs. +12.1%). The company\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter results gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 82.5 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and a rise in AI Copilot business.\nHowever, continued decline in Office commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\nShares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+48.0% vs. +29.2%). The company\u2019s second-quarter results missed earnings and revenue estimates despite witnessing strong GLP-1 product sales. Its diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand.\nLabel expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. NVO has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments in increasing its manufacturing capabilities. The drug is now indicated in the United States to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost.\nHowever, the CRL for insulin icodec in the United States is a setback for the company. Intense rivalry in the obesity sector also threatens Novo Nordisk\u2019s market share. Patent expiry, pricing pressure across the diabetes market and the pipeline setbacks remain a woe.\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\nUber\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+19.0% vs. +17.3%). The company\u2019s delivery business benefits from robust online order volumes. The company\u2019s efforts to expand its delivery operations through successive acquisitions are encouraging. Continued recovery in Mobility operations is also aiding the company.\nFor third-quarter 2024, Uber expects gross bookings of $40.25 billion-$41.75 billion. Apart from the recovery in Mobility operations and the strong performance of the Delivery unit, Uber's focus on financial discipline is encouraging as well. For third-quarter 2024, adjusted EBITDA is estimated between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion.\nOn the flip side, Uber continues to witness high costs and expenses owing to a rise in sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenues. Increased spending on driver incentives is also pushing up costs. High debt levels are bothersome as well.\n(You can read the full research report on Uber here >>>)\nShares of Spok have gained +21.7% over the past year against the Zacks Wireless National industry\u2019s gain of +40.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $298.89 million operates debt-free, providing financial stability and flexibility, bolstered by $23.9 million in cash as of Jun 30, 2024. It benefits from stable, recurring revenue, with 80% of its income derived from wireless and software services used by more than 2,200 hospitals.\nRecent software bookings show growth, with second-quarter 2024 bookings up 10.3% from the first quarter. Cost reduction initiatives and a focus on product innovation, like the GenA pager, bolster margins and competitiveness. The company's robust customer relationships highlight its potential.\nChallenges include declining wireless revenue, competitive pressures, reliance on the U.S. healthcare sector, prolonged software sales cycles, technological obsolescence and vulnerability to cyberattacks. Also, economic uncertainties and regulatory changes pose risks.\n(You can read the full research report on Spok here >>>)\nWillis Lease Finance\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry over the past year (+152.4% vs. +34.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $711.08 million made recent $363.9 million acquisition of up to 15 PW1100G-JM GTF engines, known for lower fuel consumption and compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel, enhances its asset portfolio and positions it to meet the rising demand for greener aviation solutions.\nWillis Lease Finance\u2019s strong revenues are evident, with a 36% YoY increase in total revenues for the first half of 2024, driven by high fleet utilization and effective cost management. WLFC's focus on narrow-body aircraft engines positions it well within the growing commercial aircraft leasing market. Financial flexibility is supported by diversified capital sources, allowing WLFC to fund growth.\nThe initiation of a $1.00 per share dividend in May 2024 signals confidence in its financial health. However, risks include a high $1.95 billion debt load, exposure to lease rate fluctuations and regulatory changes, which could impact financial performance.\n(You can read the full research report on Willis Lease here >>>)\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -Microsoft said on Friday it would hold a summit in September to discuss steps to improve cybersecurity systems, after a faulty update from CrowdStrike caused a global IT outage last month.\nThe conference marks the first big step by Microsoft to address the issues that affected nearly 8.5 million Windows devices on July 19, disrupting operations across industries ranging from major airlines to banks and healthcare.\nThe event will be held on Sept. 10 at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The company will invite government representatives to the gathering, it said in a blog.\n\"The CrowdStrike outage in July presents important lessons for us to apply as an ecosystem,\" Microsoft said.\nThe outage raised concerns that many organizations are not well prepared to implement contingency plans when a single point of failure such as an IT system, or a piece of software within it, goes down.\n\"We look forward to bringing our perspective to the discussions with Microsoft and industry and government stakeholders on the need for a more resilient ecosystem,\" a CrowdStrike spokesperson said when contacted for a comment.\nAnalysts have said the outage has exposed risks of dependence on single-vendor providing one-stop shop for security solutions.\nCrowdStrike, which has lost about $9 billion of its market value since the outage, has been sued by shareholders, who said the cybersecurity company defrauded them by concealing how its inadequate software testing could cause the global disruption.\nEarlier this month, Delta Air Lines said it was pursuing legal claims against CrowdStrike and Microsoft, after the outage caused mass flight cancellations and cost the carrier at least $500 million.\nCrowdStrike is scheduled to report its second-quarter financial results after the U.S. market close on Aug. 28.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Shilpi Majumdar)\n"

        "Title": "Why Microsoft Just Delivered Good News for Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Many investors were probably disappointed with Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter update after the market closed on Tuesday. The tech giant didn't hit Wall Street's expectations for cloud revenue. As a result, its shares opened lower on Wednesday.\nHowever, some investors were quite happy with Microsoft's latest quarterly update -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholders. Here's why Microsoft just delivered good news for Nvidia.\nMicrosoft executives spent a lot of time in the company's fiscal Q4 conference call discussing businesses with strong growth. Azure and other cloud services revenue jumped 29% year over year. Azure Arc hybrid and multi-cloud management customers soared by 90%. Azure AI customers increased nearly 60%. Copilot customers increased more than 60%.\nThe common thread behind all of this growth is the continued high demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products and services. Microsoft doesn't expect this demand to wane. CEO Satya Nadella said in the conference call that the company has added new data centers that are \"long-term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond.\"\nIt was Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, though, who explained the financial impact of this AI-fueled demand. She noted that the company's capital expenditures in fiscal Q4 were $19 billion. For the full year, Microsoft's capex increased significantly.\nNow for the most important part. Hood said, \"To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY '25 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY '24.\"\nMicrosoft's already soaring capex will increase -- and quickly. Hood stated, \"We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand, as well as existing AI capacity constraints.\"\nHood didn't mention Nvidia in her remarks about Microsoft's increased capital spending. But she didn't have to.\nWhat she did say, though, should be good news for Nvidia. Hood explained that roughly half of capital expenditures in the latest quarter were for infrastructure, specifically building and leasing data centers. She said the other half was \"primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs.\"\nDon't assume that the increased spending will be split equally between CPUs and GPUs. Hood mentioned that Microsoft can \"throttle\" investment in CPUs, adding \"which we've done for, I guess, a long time at this point.\" GPU spending will almost certainly be much higher than CPU spending.\nWe don't have to guess who will be the biggest beneficiary of much of (if not most of) Microsoft's increased investments in GPUs. Sure, Nadella mentioned that the company has bought some AI accelerators from AMD and deployed its own Azure Maia silicon. However, Microsoft is one of Nvidia's biggest customers. That isn't likely to change.\nNone of Microsoft's executives brought up Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture. However, it's a safe bet that some of Microsoft's increased capex will go toward buying the powerful new Blackwell-based chips.\nNvidia is poised to continue its dominance of the GPU market with Blackwell.

        "Title": "Returns on Capital Paint A Bright Future For Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) look very promising so lets take a look.\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Microsoft, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.28 = US$109b \u00f7 (US$512b - US$125b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThus, Microsoft has an ROCE of 28%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.2% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nIn the above chart we have measured Microsoft's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Microsoft  for free.\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Microsoft. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 28%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 78%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\nA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Microsoft has. And a remarkable 228% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.\nOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Microsoft and understanding it should be part of your investment process.\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\nHave feedback on this article?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER), as well as two micro-cap stocks Spok Holdings, Inc. (SPOK) and Willis Lease Finance Corp. (WLFC). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Microsoft\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+13.6% vs. +12.1%). The company\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter results gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 82.5 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and a rise in AI Copilot business.However, continued decline in Office commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+48.0% vs. +29.2%). The company\u2019s second-quarter results missed earnings and revenue estimates despite witnessing strong GLP-1 product sales. Its diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand.Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. NVO has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments in increasing its manufacturing capabilities. The drug is now indicated in the United States to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost.However, the CRL for insulin icodec in the United States is a setback for the company. Intense rivalry in the obesity sector also threatens Novo Nordisk\u2019s market share. Patent expiry, pricing pressure across the diabetes market and the pipeline setbacks remain a woe.(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)Uber\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+19.0% vs. +17.3%). The company\u2019s delivery business benefits from robust online order volumes. The company\u2019s efforts to expand its delivery operations through successive acquisitions are encouraging. Continued recovery in Mobility operations is also aiding the company.For third-quarter 2024, Uber expects gross bookings of $40.25 billion-$41.75 billion. Apart from the recovery in Mobility operations and the strong performance of the Delivery unit, Uber's focus on financial discipline is encouraging as well. For third-quarter 2024, adjusted EBITDA is estimated between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion.On the flip side, Uber continues to witness high costs and expenses owing to a rise in sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenues. Increased spending on driver incentives is also pushing up costs. High debt levels are bothersome as well.(You can read the full research report on Uber here >>>)Shares of Spok have gained +21.7% over the past year against the Zacks Wireless National industry\u2019s gain of +40.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $298.89 million operates debt-free, providing financial stability and flexibility, bolstered by $23.9 million in cash as of Jun 30, 2024. It benefits from stable, recurring revenue, with 80% of its income derived from wireless and software services used by more than 2,200 hospitals.Recent software bookings show growth, with second-quarter 2024 bookings up 10.3% from the first quarter. Cost reduction initiatives and a focus on product innovation, like the GenA pager, bolster margins and competitiveness. The company's robust customer relationships highlight its potential.Challenges include declining wireless revenue, competitive pressures, reliance on the U.S. healthcare sector, prolonged software sales cycles, technological obsolescence and vulnerability to cyberattacks. Also, economic uncertainties and regulatory changes pose risks.(You can read the full research report on Spok here >>>)Willis Lease Finance\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry over the past year (+152.4% vs. +34.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $711.08 million made recent $363.9 million acquisition of up to 15 PW1100G-JM GTF engines, known for lower fuel consumption and compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel, enhances its asset portfolio and positions it to meet the rising demand for greener aviation solutions.Willis Lease Finance\u2019s strong revenues are evident, with a 36% YoY increase in total revenues for the first half of 2024, driven by high fleet utilization and effective cost management. WLFC's focus on narrow-body aircraft engines positions it well within the growing commercial aircraft leasing market. Financial flexibility is supported by diversified capital sources, allowing WLFC to fund growth.The initiation of a $1.00 per share dividend in May 2024 signals confidence in its financial health. However, risks include a high $1.95 billion debt load, exposure to lease rate fluctuations and regulatory changes, which could impact financial performance.(You can read the full research report on Willis Lease here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Deere & Co.

        "Text": "A bounce-back quarter for Salesforce (CRM).\nShares of the SaaS company were slightly higher on Thursday after rising as much as 5% in extended trading after it bested Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins, and earnings.\nThe reaction \u2014 and tone around the quarter's performance \u2014 is in stark contrast to just three months ago, when the company shockingly missed sales estimates for the first time since 2006.\nDemand remains strong, and there are \"big goals\" for operating margins and cash flow, Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me on Yahoo Finance.\nSales increased 11% in Europe and 16% in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. The company's Americas segment notched 8% sales growth.\n\"I don't think anyone expected a repeat performance of that [last quarter],\" Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance. \nAdded Miner, \"What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin. Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history.\"\nThe company maintained its full year sales outlook, but lifted its expectations for operating margins. That may spur enthusiasm that Salesforce's various AI initiatives will boost profits.\nTo that end, Benioff teased the coming launch of AgentForce, which features AI sales agents that go beyond chatbots and can resolve customer inquiries. Benioff said more details will be shared in September at the company's closely watched Dreamforce conference.\nBut he tells me the service is a higher margin opportunity and will be priced by conversation. Benioff envisions one billion agents in service by the end of fiscal year 2026.\nHe also said Microsoft has \"misled\" customers \"that they have to do so much heavy lifting on the technology side.\" Salesforce aims to enable customers to train their models within its platform.\n\"They get real value from AI now,\" he said of Salesforce's offerings.\n\"One of the biggest initiatives in the field is around monetizing the AI theme within the Salesforce massive installed base.

        "Title": "Should Investors Buy Microsoft Stock on the Dip After Azure Revenue Disappoints?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been helping lead the charge in artificial intelligence (AI), so when fiscal fourth-quarter revenue for its Azure cloud computing business came up short of analyst expectations, investors were a bit disappointed. After a strong run through early July, the stock dropped a bit and is now up only about 10% on the year.\nLet's take a closer look a Microsoft's latest results and whether the stock is a buy after the 10% pullback from its recent July highs.\nFor its fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft reported a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue to $64.7 billion while its earnings per share (EPS) rose 10% to $2.95. That came in just ahead of analyst expectations for revenue of $64.5 billion and EPS of $2.94.\nAzure once again helped lead the way with year-over-year revenue growth of 29% (30% in constant currency). However, that was at the low end of the 30% to 31% constant currency revenue growth that Microsoft forecast earlier. Overall Intelligent Cloud revenue, the segment where Azure resides, rose 19% to $28.5 billion.\nAzure AI customers grew by 60% in the quarter, while its subscription and usage rates have seen a significant increase. It also introduced new AI accelerators and models.\nMicrosoft said capacity constraints impacted Azure's growth and that these constraints will likely last into the first half of fiscal year 2025. In response, it has partnered with companies like Oracle and Cohere to expand Azure AI's capacity. Microsoft will make infrastructure investments to meet demand, while also focusing on managing expenses to take a disciplined approach to growth.\nThe Productivity and Business Processes segment, home to Office and LinkedIn, saw its revenue increase 11% year over year to $20.3 billion. Dynamics 365 revenue led the way with 19% growth, while Office 365 Commercial revenue rose 13%. Revenue for More Personal Computing, home to Windows and Xbox, climbed 14% to $15.9 billion. The increase was powered by Microsoft's recent acquisition of video game maker Activision.\nLooking ahead, Microsoft forecasts double-digit revenue and operating income growth for fiscal year 2025. It also expects capital expenditures (capex) to be higher than in fiscal year 2024.\nFor the first quarter, Microsoft expects revenue to be between $63.8 billion and $64.8 billion. The company is looking for its Intelligent Cloud segment to grow between 18% and 20% to $28.6 billion and $28.9 billion, with Azure growth of between 28% and 29% in constant currency. The Productivity and Business Processes segment is expected to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency, while More Personal Computing is forecast to grow between 9% and 12% in constant currency.\nThe slightly lower-than-expected revenue growth from Azure appears to be largely related to capacity constraints and some non-AI business in Europe as opposed to any AI demand issues. Ultimately, the Azure business is strong and still leading the way for the company.\nNow Microsoft will have to invest in infrastructure to continue to build out the business, which is something investors have become a bit more sensitive about recently. However, this is something that all companies in the cloud computing space need to do in order to keep up with demand, and I think it would be worse if these companies weren't planning to increase capex to take advantage of the AI opportunities in front of them.\nAzure has been taking market share in the cloud computing space, so the company should get a good return on its capex investment. Meanwhile, Microsoft continues to see solid low-double-digit growth in its other two business segments, helped by Copilot and other AI features it has introduced.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, the stock now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 32 with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) of under 0.9. While that doesn't put the stock in the bargain bin, it is still an attractive valuation considering its AI opportunities.\nGiven the growth opportunities still ahead of Microsoft, especially with Azure, I would be a buyer of the stock on this dip. However, I would consider taking a starter position and then dollar-cost averaging on any further price dips.\nThis can be a good investment strategy when buying a stock that has been seeing some near-term selling pressure. Over the long term, though, Microsoft still appears poised to be an AI winner.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "Google had a bad day on Monday. A federal judge ruled in the first major antitrust case against big tech in over two decades that Google has an illegal monopoly on the search market. As a result of its pervasive presence on phones and browsers, the tech company was able to hike advertisement rates with few consequences. According to the Department of Justice, Google paid $26 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine for the masses.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s distribution agreements foreclose a substantial portion of the general search services market and impair rivals\u2019 opportunities to compete,\u201d judge Amit Mehta said in the case\u2019s 286-page ruling.\nWith Google\u2019s $2 trillion parent company Alphabet a force to be reckoned with in the tech world,\nthe outcome of the case is bound to cascade beyond Google and its users. As the dust settled on the case, tech and antitrust experts said the lawsuit could have plenty of ripples on entities in the tech industry\u2014for better or for worse. Here are the winners and losers they identified.\nWhile the DOJ is the obvious victor in the case\u2019s ruling, the Federal Trade Commission\u2014which is currently embroiled in lawsuits with other big tech companies like Apple, and readying antitrust probes into Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI\u2014could also benefit from the case, according to George Hay, a senior law professor at Cornell University. The FTC\u2019s approach now is a departure from the era of the 1990s and 2000s during a period of rapid innovation, when the regulatory body took years to crack down on the meteoric rise of tech monopolies.\n\u201cIt suggests that the court is willing to take on a dominant firm and explain why it's so dominant and attribute some antitrust liability to some reason for dominance,\u201d he told Fortune.\nBut despite the Justice Department getting a favorable ruling, Adam Kovacevich, former Google policy director and founder of the tech coalition Chamber of Progress, told Fortune that tech will continue to win big, likely crowning Microsoft as the case\u2019s biggest winner.\n\u201cThe thing about big tech antitrust crusades is that the big winner, many times, is another big tech company,\u201d he said.\nAs a result of the suit, Google could be prohibited from bidding in default deals, Kovacevich said, leaving the door open for other search engines to take advantage. Because of Microsoft\u2019s power and influence in the industry\u2014to the tune of a $3 trillion market capitalization\u2014it should have no problem securing its search engine Bing as the default for some major platforms, Kovacevich argued.\nMicrosoft has openly expressed this as a goal. CEO Satya Nadella testified in Google\u2019s antitrust case in 2023, saying how hard it was to strike a deal with Apple to replace Google as its default browser. Though Bing lacks a robust usership compared to Google, Nadella promised in his testimony the company would be able to invest more in the engine.\nIt\u2019s also a symbolic victory for Microsoft, which, 23 years ago, lost the last major federal antitrust case. In 2000, the DOJ ruled Microsoft violated antitrust laws through the restrictions it put on PC manufacturers. But Microsoft came out relatively unscathed: After George W. Bush became president in 2001, the company had the opportunity to settle the suit. Microsoft was also able to avoid splitting into two companies, the original request of the judge. But despite dodging a bullet in the remedy stage of the case, there\u2019s still a desire from the juggernaut to stay on top and give other big tech companies a taste of what it experienced, Kovacevich said.\n\u201cBasically for 20 years now, Microsoft's position has been, \u2018We didn't agree with the government, but this is what they did to us, and so they should do the same thing to Google,\u2019\u201d he said.\nMicrosoft declined Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nWith the potential for big tech to be humbled, Luther Lowe, head of public policy at startup accelerator Y Combinator, believes the impending remedies could benefit tech startups unable to previously compete with Google\u2019s massive resources.\n\u201cThis ruling could significantly reshape the competitive landscape to benefit \u2018little tech\u2019 by reducing Google's gatekeeping power & creating more open competition in search & digital advertising,\u201d he wrote on X.\nKovacevich isn\u2019t so sure. While smaller search engine sites like DuckDuckGo may have less competition, depending on the remedies from the case, it\u2019s a long shot for it to be able to increase its market share. Because these smaller tech companies lack Microsoft and Google\u2019s funding, their products simply aren't as strong or user-friendly.\n\u201cBut how do you force consumers to choose a certain inferior search engine?\u201d Kovacevich said.\nDuckDuckGo told Fortune in a statement it does offer a competitive search engine alternative and applauded the DOJ\u2019s decision in the antitrust case.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve passed a key milestone, but there\u2019s still a lot of history to be written and Google will do anything it can to get in the way of progress which is why we hope to see a robust remedies trial that can really dig into all the details, propose an array of remedies that will actually work, and set up a monitoring body to administer them,\u201d the company said.\nThe ruling of Google\u2019s suit could have a big impact on Samsung and Apple, which have shelled out on deals to have Google as their default search engines. Apple paid $20 billion in 2022 alone to have Google as Safari\u2019s default search bar. Mehta argued in the hearing those agreements were detrimental to competition, accounting for 94.9% of the search market. Following the ruling, the future of these deals are unclear.\nBut while both tech companies\u2014and Apple in particular\u2014may appear to be most directly impacted by the outcome of the antitrust case, the biggest loser is likely Mozilla, Kovacevich said. When users type in search queries into Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browser, it reroutes them to Google. Mozilla\u2019s deal with Google is incredibly lucrative, making up $510 million of its $593 million in revenue, according to its 2021-2022 financial statements. It also heavily relies on Google\u2019s participation in bidding wars over default deals, according to Kovacevich. If Google is no longer able to participate in default deals, there\u2019s less incentive for replacement candidates like Microsoft to want to pay as much for platforms to use Bing. That could impact Mozilla\u2019s financial dependence on Google, with lower bids and less revenue for Mozilla.\n\u201cWhat Mozilla was benefiting from was the bidding war between Google, and so I think that is almost certainly going to go away,\u201d Kovacevich said.\nMozilla said it's closely reviewing the case to examine its impact on the company.\n\u201cMozilla has always championed competition and choice online, particularly in search,\u201d a spokesperson told Fortune in a statement on Monday. \u201cFirefox continues to offer a range of search options, and we remain committed to serving our users\u2019 preferences while fostering a competitive market.\u201d\nWith rumblings of potential default search engine changes, there\u2019s also potential for users perfectly happy with Google\u2019s massive search bar presence to be inconvenienced. And the outsized consequence could be that people grow frustrated with other platforms, and leave them altogether.\nThere\u2019s past precedent for a user revolt. In 2014, Mozilla switched its Firefox default search tool from Google to Yahoo as part of a $375 million five-year-deal. The quality of the experience with Yahoo paled in comparison to its competitor, however, and users simply left the browser. Mozilla CEO Mitchell Baker called it a \u201cfailed\u201d bet, and by the end of 2017, Mozilla had reverted its default browser back to Google\nPrecedent and evidence aside, the shakeout to determine the true winners and losers of the case will take months, Hay warned. Google will appeal the decision, Kent Walker, president of global affairs said in a statement to Fortune, with a separate DOJ hearing to discuss remedies scheduled for September. Until then, Google has \u201cno real incentive to change behavior,\u201d according to Hay.\n\u201cNothing's going to happen for quite a while,\u201d he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Among Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities\u2019 PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 279\nGS' Number Of Funds: 79\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another big tech giant. Like Alphabet, the firm plays a key role in the artificial intelligence industry, and it benefits from its close partnership with OpenAI - the firm that's responsible for popularizing AI in the collective imaginations of investors and the general public. While the exact figure isn't known, what is clear is that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has invested billions of dollars in AI, which means that the technology - and its monetization - are now a fundamental part of the big tech firm's $3 trillion market capitalization. In fact, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s enterprise computing business, which accounted for $28.5 billion of its $64 billion in FYQ4 revenue, is another key component of the AI hypothesis as the firm is expected to earn revenue from AI by targeting products to business and enterprise users. In fact, this exposure to enterprise spending has been part of the reason why Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s shares are down by 11% since July while Apple's shares have lost just 2.89% as investors are increasingly worried about near term AI revenue generation.\nBaron Funds mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"Microsoft Corporation is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Oice products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Oice 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over- quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year- over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best- positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\"\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While the current buzzword for the hottest tech stocks might be the \"Magnificent Seven,\" that could soon turn into the Terrific Three.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have put a considerable amount of daylight between themselves and the remainder of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.\nNvidia, Microsoft, and Apple all have market caps in the range of $3 trillion, and all are among the leaders in the AI revolution in different ways.\nNvidia is the leading chipmaker, building the AI infrastructure that is powering new large language models and applications like ChatGPT. More than any other company, Nvidia has defined the current AI era, and its stock has been the biggest gainer based on market cap.\nMicrosoft has established itself as a leader in AI applications thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft has invested an estimated $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker, and it has forged a close partnership with OpenAI, which has allowed it to deploy ChatGPT across a wide range of products, including Azure, its Office suite, GitHub, and Bing, and the AI-based Copilot, as well as other AI tools already driving meaningful growth for Microsoft.\nFinally, Apple has been somewhat late to the AI party, but the iPhone maker can't be ignored when it comes to a new technology like AI. That's because Apple has an installed base of active devices of 2.2 billion, meaning that it controls the connectivity to AI for billions of users. Apple is also releasing Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools like a writing assistant, which is expected to be available to consumers shortly.\nAs the descriptions show, all three of these companies have their own strengths in AI, and all three stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in the AI era. However, Nvidia has been the clear winner during that time, as the chart below shows.\nNvidia is also the most expensive stock of the three based on its trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which is currently 65, compared to Microsoft at 37 and Apple at 33.\nHowever, Nvidia is also the fastest-growing of the three stocks and is expected to grow revenue by 98% this year, compared to Microsoft at 16% and Apple at 8%.\nBecause of that, Nvidia' forward P/E is much lower, at just 40, bringing it more in line with that of Microsoft and Apple.\nOf the three stocks, Nvidia's future is the most closely tied to AI. Its revenue more than tripled over its last four quarters as it's become the de facto supplier of GPUs and other components needed for AI infrastructure.\nNvidia's also moving fast to release new products and stay on the cutting edge of AI and ahead of the competition. The company just announced a suite of services and computing platforms to help build the next generation of humanoid robots.\nAdditionally, the company recently launched its new Blackwell platform, which can process trillion-parameter large language models at as much as 25 times less cost and energy than Nvidia's previous Hopper architecture.\nNvidia has executed nearly perfectly since the beginning of the generative AI era, and the company looks like a good bet to continue to dominate the market for AI hardware.\nWhile Microsoft and Apple both have their own strengths in AI, they don't have the same level of exposure to AI that Nvidia does, and they haven't demonstrated the same ability to develop new AI technology.\nIf you're bullish on AI, Nvidia looks like the best stock of the three to own today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Microsoft fair value estimate is US$573\nMicrosoft's US$424 share price signals that it might be 26% undervalued\n Analyst price target for MSFT is US$498 which is 13% below our fair value estimate\nHow far off is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$77.3b\nUS$92.4b\nUS$116.2b\nUS$138.4b\nUS$165.8b\nUS$186.3b\nUS$203.9b\nUS$218.8b\nUS$231.7b\nUS$243.0b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x25\nAnalyst x23\nAnalyst x9\nAnalyst x7\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 12.37%\nEst @ 9.41%\nEst @ 7.34%\nEst @ 5.89%\nEst @ 4.87%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% \nUS$72.5k\nUS$81.2k\nUS$95.8k\nUS$106.9k\nUS$120.1k\nUS$126.5k\nUS$129.8k\nUS$130.6k\nUS$129.6k\nUS$127.5k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.1t\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$243b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.7%\u2013 2.5%) = US$6.0t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$6.0t\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$3.1t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.3t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$424, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.011. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up by 2.1% over the past month. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Microsoft's  ROE in this article.\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:\n33% = US$88b \u00f7 US$268b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.33 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Microsoft has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 15% net income growth seen by Microsoft over the past five years.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Microsoft's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 19% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MSFT worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MSFT is currently mispriced by the market.\nMicrosoft has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 26% (or a retention ratio of 74%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.\nBesides, Microsoft has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 22%. As a result, Microsoft's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 28% for future ROE.\nOn the whole, we feel that Microsoft's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "It\u2019s been a big couple days in the increasingly active defense tech sector.\nToday, Microsoft and Palantir announced they will bundle their AI services for U.S. military and intelligence, with Microsoft contributing GPT-4 and other OpenAI models, and Palantir throwing in its targeting, data-analysis, and action-proposing tools. This is the first partnership around deploying Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service in classified environments, Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar noted in a statement\u2014though Microsoft, on its own, did deploy GPT-4 to its Azure Government Top Secret environment in May. And of course, the relevant government agencies still need to bite.\nMicrosoft and Palantir say their combined services could be used in logistics, contracting, and action planning, among other things.\nAs Military.com reported last month, there is little agreement among the armed forces regarding the use of generative AI. Some have security concerns, such as the Space Force (which has paused the use of the technology) and the Navy. The Army is reportedly more open to generative AI, though it still lacks clear rules to govern its use.\nEarlier this week, Palantir also delivered a Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node\u00a0(TITAN) prototype to a military base in Washington State, Axios reported. TITAN is a wheeled ground station system that uses AI to assist targeting decisions, based on data collected from sensors in the air, on land, and in space.\nPalantir won the $178.4 million Army deal a couple of months back and will develop 10 TITAN prototypes for testing. Bearing in mind that we\u2019re talking about what\u2019s generally seen as a data company, it\u2019s remarkable that it\u2019s now delivering hardware\u2014thanks to subcontractors such as Northrop Grumman and Anduril.\nSpeaking of Anduril, Palmer Luckey\u2019s defense tech startup just pulled in a fresh $1.5 billion in funding, as it takes aim at the more traditional likes of Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin\u2014Anduril recently won out against these rivals for an Air Force contract to develop and test prototypes of small, unmanned fighter jets.\nThe new round, co-led by Founders Fund and Sands Capital, values Anduril at $14 billion, which TechCrunch points out is a darn sight more than the $8.5 billion valuation the firm boasted less than two years ago. It\u2019s also more than the $12.5 billion valuation that Anduril was reportedly seeking less than three months ago.\nAs my colleague Luisa Beltran wrote a couple weeks ago, defense tech\u2014particularly when it involves hardware\u2014is becoming a more attractive bet for investors than used to be the case. That\u2019s partly because software is looking less lucrative in a scenario where AI becomes a capable coder, and partly because of the wars in Ukraine and Israel/Palestine, plus geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.\nSee also: Germany\u2019s Helsing raising $489 million in July, at a valuation of $5.4 billion. The defense AI firm\u2019s previous round in September last year pulled in less than half that amount, at less than a third of the valuation.\nThere are of course serious ethical questions about the use of AI for target selection, and not much in the way of an international legal framework for controlling the phenomenon. Reported deployments in Gaza and Ukraine make these questions more urgent than anyone might have expected a couple years back\u2014and so do deals like those on display this week.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Navellier & Associates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks approved by Navellier & Associates.\nFounded in 1987 by growth analyst Louis Navellier, Navellier & Associates is an independent firm based in Reno, Nevada. Navellier & Associates specializes in identifying market inefficiencies to find top-growth stocks through a disciplined quantitative and fundamental analysis system. With over 30 years of experience, they offer customized portfolio strategies for individual investors to maximize returns while managing risk. Unlike competitors who mimic indexes, Navellier aims to outperform them, resulting in low correlation with benchmarks and increased diversification.\nLouis Navellier is the Founder, Chairman of the Board, Chief Investment Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer of Navellier & Associates, Inc. With decades of experience applying academic techniques to real market scenarios, he advocates for disciplined quantitative analysis to identify stocks that can outperform the market. His approach involves a rigorous three-step process: quantitative analysis, fundamental analysis, and optimization of selected securities for portfolio inclusion. This approach has been used by the firm where they employ a highly disciplined, bottom-up stock-selection process for most portfolios. First, they screen market and stock statistics to measure reward (alpha) and risk (standard deviation), selecting stocks in the top percentiles. Next, they further screen the top-ranked stocks for high-profit margins, strong earnings growth, and reasonable price/earnings ratios based on future earnings. Finally, a proprietary optimization model maximizes portfolio alpha while minimizing standard deviation, creating well-diversified portfolios across various sectors and industries.\nSince 1980, he has shared his insights through the MPT Review, a stock advisory newsletter. Since 1987, he has actively managed individual portfolios, mutual funds, and institutional portfolios. Known for his charismatic leadership, Louis Navellier has been featured extensively in international media, including CNBC, Bloomberg, The Nightly Business Report, and Wall Street Week. His insights have also been highlighted in Barron\u2019s, Forbes, Fortune, Investor\u2019s Business Daily, Money, Smart Money, and The Wall Street Journal. He has been profiled in books such as Kenneth A. Stern\u2019s \"Secrets of the Investment All-Stars\" and Alan R. Ackerman\u2019s \"Investing Under Fire.\" Mr. Navellier earned his B.S. in business administration in 1978 and his M.B.A. in finance in 1979 from California State University \u2013 Hayward.\nNavellier & Associates is a well-known advisory firm with 1,314 clients and manages assets worth $743,578,818, as reported in their Form ADV from March 2024. Their Q1 2024 filing shows they handle $811,568,534 in securities, with the top 10 holdings making up 29.01% of the total.\nOur Methodology\nThis article covers Navellier & Associates' top 10 stock picks for the first quarter of 2024.

        "Title": "Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)",
        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller is betting on.\nWhen it comes to growth offerings, there are few money managers on Wall Street whose opinion carries more weight on the matter than Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief of New York-based investment firm Duquesne Capital. Druckenmiller oversees a 13F portfolio at his hedge fund that was worth close to $3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024. As the AI craze sweeps Wall Street, Druckenmiller has outlined his bullish long-term thesis on the new technology, recently appearing in a program on news platform CNBC to claim that the AI revolution was bigger than the excitement around blockchain, the internet, or other previous tech-related breakthroughs in the recent past.\nDuring his appearance on the show, the billionaire noted that anybody who was talking about the internet back in 1999, before the advent of high-speed wireless connections and smart devices, could not have estimated that it would become as big as it did in the twenty or so years since that time. He further highlighted how the NASDAQ, the tech-heavy benchmark index, plunged 80% during the dotcom crisis at the turn of the millennium before offering investors handsome returns in the long-term. The money manager compared this to the AI universe and said that with the capital spending on the new tech, the big payoff in the sector might take four or five years to materialize.\nDruckenmiller further added that AI was a trend like he had never seen before but cautioned listeners that he was not Warren Buffett and did not own things for 20 years - a reference to the long term investing strategy of the Oracle of Omaha. The remarks were in defense of his 13F activity during the first quarter of 2024. The billionaire told CNBC that he needed a break from some AI-focused positions because there had been a hell of a run, and a lot of what his fund recognized had become recognized by the marketplace. However, Drucknemiller clarified that he remained bullish on AI in the long-term.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we scanned the stock portfolio of Duquesne Capital according to the 13F filings submitted at the end of the second quarter of 2024. We selected the top 10 stocks from this portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nDuquesne Capital\u2019s Stake: $178,999,000\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. It is one of the longest holdings in the Duquesne Capital portfolio. Druckenmiller first disclosed a stake in the tech giant during the first quarter of 2014. Since then, barring minor exceptions in 2016 and 2022, it has been a regular feature in the 13F portfolio of his hedge fund. The present holding, comprising over 400,000 shares, represents more than 6.1% of the total 13F portfolio. Latest filings reveal that Druckenmiller has reduced his exposure to the stock by more than 64% compared to filings for the first quarter of 2024.\nThis activity is interesting given that most analysts on Wall Street are bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in light of the AI boom. For example, Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne has an Outperform rating on the shares with a price target of $500. In a recent investor note, the analyst noted that the tech giant had delivered solid fiscal Q4 results with strong commercial bookings, but shares were down slightly as Azure growth came in at the low end of expectations and Q1 Azure guidance was also a bit lower than expected.\nOverall MSFT ranks 6th on our list of stocks Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller is betting on. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Sage Lazzaro ",
        "Text": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\nCybersecurity professionals from around the world gathered last week at Black Hat USA, the prominent conference for catching up on the latest cyber threats and how to defend against them. While I wasn\u2019t at the event in Las Vegas and instead soaked up demo videos and presentation slides from afar, it\u2019s clear\u2014and no surprise\u2014that AI was a prominent topic of conversation. The schedule boasted a few dozen sessions focused on the technology, including a keynote titled \u201cAI is Ruining My Life: Group Therapy for Security Leaders.\u201d The one that has seemingly gotten the most attention, however, is a demo showcasing five ways Microsoft\u2019s Copilot could be manipulated by attackers, including turning it into an \u201cautomated phishing machine,\u201d as Wired put it.\nThe attack methods were presented by Michael Bargury, cofounder and CTO of Zenity and a former Microsoft security architect. What\u2019s particularly interesting is how all of them rely on using the LLM-based tool as it was designed to be used\u2014asking the chatbot questions to prompt it to retrieve data from a user\u2019s own Microsoft workspace. Copilot lives in the company\u2019s 365 software (like Word and Teams) and is meant to help users boost their productivity by summarizing meeting information, looking up details buried in emails, and helping craft messages. Bargury\u2019s demo shows how the same technology and processes that make those capabilities possible could be used maliciously, too.\nFor example, several of the attacks require the malicious actor to have already gained access to someone\u2019s email account, but they drastically increase and expedite what the attacker can do once inside. Copilot\u2019s ability to help a user draft emails in their personal writing style could also enable an attacker to easily mimic someone\u2019s writing style at scale and blast out convincing emails with malware or malicious links to unsuspecting colleagues. Once inside an email account, Copilot\u2019s ability to quickly retrieve data from documents, correspondences, and loads of other places inside a company\u2019s workflow could also enable an attacker to easily access sensitive company information. Bargury even demonstrated using Copilot to circumvent the company\u2019s access permissions, wording prompts in a particular way that gets the chatbot to relay information the user doesn\u2019t have permission to view.\n\u201cYou talk to Copilot and it\u2019s a limited conversation because Microsoft has put a lot of controls. But once you use a few magic words, it opens up and you can do whatever you want,\u201d Bargury told Wired.\nWithout having to compromise any email accounts, Bargury also demonstrated how malicious actors could use Copilot to hijack a company\u2019s financial transactions and lead an employee to direct payments intended for a trusted entity into the hacker\u2019s own account. First, a hacker would send an email to a victim at the company that presents their bank information as the trusted entity\u2019s. If the employee uses Copilot to search for that entity\u2019s banking information, Copilot could then surface the malicious email and lead the victim to send the money to the malicious actor instead. In the same vein, a hacker could send a malicious email to direct someone to a phishing site. Both scenarios would involve Copilot surfacing and presenting malicious content as a trusted information source.\nWhile these were proof-of-concepts demonstrating how Copilot could be manipulated and not evidence of the chatbot being used widely by hackers in these ways, the techniques do mirror those for manipulating LLMs that we know are in fact being used. In his talk on the most common and impactful LLM attacks discovered throughout this past \u201cyear in the trenches,\u201d Nvidia principal security architect Richard Harang similarly discussed LLMs incorrectly handling document permissions as well as prompt injection attacks like Bargury demonstrated, wherein attackers manipulate LLMs to leak sensitive data and assist in other harms by disguising malicious inputs as legitimate prompts.\nSpeaking to Wired, Microsoft head of AI incident detection and response Philim Misner said the company appreciates Bargury\u2019s work identifying the vulnerabilities and is working with him to address them. While the implications are enormous for Microsoft and the many businesses small and large that use the company\u2019s software, it\u2019s important to point out that these issues are in no way unique to Microsoft or its copilot. Microsoft Copilot\u2019s deep integration with sensitive company information and flows of communication makes for an especially vulnerable scenario, but all of its enterprise competitors are creating the same type of AI-assistant experience within their software, too. At the same time, all LLMs are vulnerable to attacks and general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT have also been exploited as hacking tools. Ask any security researcher or executive about the impact on cybersecurity and they will sigh while telling you how generative AI has completely upended the cyber threat landscape\u2014as was made clear at both Black Hat and Def Con (a hacking convention following the main Black Hat event where Fortune\u2019s Sharon Goldman reported from this past weekend) and in pretty much every discussion of cybersecurity since ChatGPT was released in 2022.\nWith vulnerabilities in Microsoft\u2019s LLM in the spotlight at Black Hat, it may seem ironic that another talk by a Microsoft security engineer focused on how that same LLM technology can be leveraged to boost security responses. In fact, there\u2019s nothing more typical cybersecurity than that. Every breakthrough in technology has created new tools and attack points for the hackers to hack, and at the same time, new ways for the defenders to defend. AI is only the latest technology to kick off a new era of cybersecurity cat-and-mouse\u2014and it is a big one. But the cycle continues.\nAnd with that, here\u2019s more AI news.\nSage Lazzarosage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.comsagelazzaro.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: International Business Machines Corporation IBM, Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s AMZN and Microsoft Corporation\u2019s MSFT.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nInternational Business Machines Corporationrecently augmented the generative AI capabilities of its managed Threat Detection and Response Services with the launch of the IBM Consulting Cybersecurity Assistant.\nDesigned to accelerate and improve the identification, investigation and response to critical security threats, the Cybersecurity Assistant will form an integral part of IBM's watsonx data and AI platform along with IBM Consulting Advantage. This, in turn, is expected to empower IBM consultants to respond more proactively and precisely to critical cyber threats with consistency, repeatability, quality and agility.\nThe Cybersecurity Assistant includes a generative AI conversational engine with real-time insights and support on operational tasks to both clients and IBM security analysts. Utilizing IBM's broader generative AI capabilities that are built on the company's Granite foundation models and watsonx.ai platform, it can continuously learn from investigations, leading to faster response and accuracy with time.\nLeveraging historical correlation analysis of similar threats, the Cybersecurity Assistant will aim to provide a holistic and integrative threat management approach to help security analysts better comprehend critical threats. In addition, it will reduce manual investigations and operational tasks with auto-recommend actions based on the historical patterns of analyzed activity and pre-set confidence levels. This, in turn, will help to effectively mitigate multi-dimensional cyber threats that have become rampant over time.\nIn March, IBM took a giant step forward in enterprise AI innovation by integrating the open-source Mixtral-8x7B large language model into its watsonx AI and data platform. Built on innovative Sparse modeling and the Mixture-of-Experts technique, this model excels in rapid data processing and contextual analysis. Its ability to efficiently handle vast datasets makes it a valuable asset for businesses seeking actionable insights.\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform comprises three products to help organizations accelerate and scale AI \u2014 the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning; the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store, built on an open lake house architecture; and the watsonx.governance toolkit to help enable AI workflows to be built with responsibility and transparency.\nDespite solid hybrid cloud and AI traction, IBM is facing stiff competition from Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corporation\u2019s Azure. Increasing pricing pressure is eroding margins and profitability has mostly trended down over the years, barring occasional spikes. The company\u2019s ongoing, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is a challenging task. Weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns.\nOver the past year, IBM has gained 34.5% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 18.9%, outperforming its peers.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, IBM appears to be trading at a premium relative to the industry and is trading well above its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 18.69 forward earnings, higher than 17.14 for the industry and the stock\u2019s mean of 12.64.\nIBM aims to benefit from the increasing propensity of business enterprises to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to secure multi-cloud management with a diligent focus on hybrid cloud and generative AI solutions. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities are key growth drivers.\nHowever, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), IBM appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. It is also trading at premium valuation metrics and investors could wait for a better entry point to cash in on its long-term fundamentals. Consequently, it might not be a prudent investment decision to bet on the stock at the moment.

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Hedge Funds Recommend This Self Driving Car Stock Now",
        "Author": "  Talha Qureshi ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other self driving car stocks.\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and machine learning are shaping how industries perform today. These three technological advancements have enhanced the potential of autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).\nHowever, are the consumers ready to put their hands off the driving wheel and trust self-driving vehicles? Let\u2019s explore how the autonomous driving industry is progressing with almost all major automotive manufacturers investing significantly to put their Full Self Driving (FSD) cars on the road.\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global autonomous vehicle market is valued at $41.10 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.75% to reach $114.54 billion by 2029. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered the overall output of the automotive industry thereby delaying the production and roll-out of self-driving cars. In addition, increased government regulations to ensure road safety have also proved to be a barrier for automakers. However, with significant improvement in software and hardware technology backed by artificial intelligence, we see automakers rolling out their Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous cars on public roads.\nFor instance, on June 25 CNBC reported that Waymo a leading autonomous vehicle company, opened its self-driving robot taxis for users in San Francisco. The company claims that more than 300,000 people signed up for the service. To cater for the growing number of users Waymo One has rolled out a fleet of 300 cars in the city.\nAccording to a survey by McKinsey & Company, automotive market leaders believe the autonomous segment to be less fragmented due to the complexity and investment involved in its operations. As per the survey, 15% of the respondents believe North America will have most companies working and deploying autonomous technology in the future. In contrast, 38% of respondents believe the European market to be led by at most two or three companies.\nRegionally speaking, China and North America are leading the race to become the first countries to roll out Level 4 highway pilot technology. Respondents of the survey are equally divided with 58% believing either country could be the first in Level 4 technology.\nAs mentioned above, developing and rolling out autonomous vehicles requires a huge investment in software technology. However, the investment is also expected to return high margins. The survey found that experts believe autonomous vehicle software is expected to have an average margin of 15% and hardware technology will add another 10% to the margin, thereby making the autonomous vehicle segment a lucrative venture for automotive companies.\nEmerging trends in the autonomous vehicle industry are paving the way towards achieving level 5 autonomy. Some of the latest developments in the industry include, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to allow vehicles to connect with other vehicles, its environment, and the internet. This not only improves the vehicle safety by providing quick data acquisition and analysis to make timely decisions based on the traffic changes on the road. New sensor technologies such as the LiDAR scans the surrounding of the car using laser technology. When these LiDAR sensors move continuously using multiple laser sensors they create a 3D representation of the surrounding ensuring the vehicle drives safely without collision. Almost all level 3 autonomous vehicles use LiDAR scanners to enhance vehicle visibility to around 300 meters during daytime.\nMoreover, advancements in artificial intelligence such as object detection algorithms along with the LiDAR help the vehicle detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles on the road. Other deep learning algorithms are helping improve the user experience by enhanced voice recognition, gesture recognition, and sentiment analysis to help interact with the vehicle efficiently. Last but not the least, Big Data analysis techniques are being utilized by autonomous automakers to improve vehicle autonomy through analyzing data collected through radars, scanners, and cameras.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the 10 best self-driving car stocks to buy, we looked at autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF. We selected the top 20 stocks from the ETF holdings and ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q1 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 293\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading developer and provider of support software, services, devices, and solutions. The company is driven by its significant advancement in artificial intelligence and cloud services, including Azure AI and Copilot.\nThe solution software and cloud services provided by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are used in an array of industries including the mobility and automation sector. The company leverages its Azure software to provide a robust infrastructure for autonomous vehicle operations, including data ingestion, processing, analysis and development of machine learning models required to power autonomous driving systems.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is working with multiple leading automotive companies to accelerate developments in automation. Some of the prominent names working with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) include Wayve, a London-based company pioneering deep learning for autonomous vehicles and Wejo Group Limited, a leader in connected vehicle data.\nThe company posted a successful fourth quarter of 2024. Its revenue was up 15 year-over-year to reach $245 billion. Revenue growth was due to strong performance across the board. The intelligent cloud segment revenue witnessed a notable increase of 19% year-over-year and reached $28.5 billion. Azure and other cloud services led the growth in this segment by improving service revenue by almost 30% during the year.\nDue to the strong performance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was able to increase its operating income to $27.9 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. Moreover, the balance sheet of the company also improved significantly with the free cash flow increasing 18% year-over-year to $23.3 billion. As the company continues to improve its cloud services and Azure with AI integration, its utility for the autonomous vehicle grows with it.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a good investment, we say this because it was held by 293 hedge funds during the Q1 of 2024, with stakes worth $88.16 billion. Impax Asset Management is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $1.24 billion. 60 analysts have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, with their 12-month median price target of $498 presenting an upside of 23% from the current level.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nThe top absolute contributors were Alphabet,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure\u2019s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best self driving car stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "By Huw Jones\nLONDON (Reuters) - London Stock Exchange Group's income rose strongly in the first half, beating analysts' expectations, helped by progress with its Microsoft joint venture, as well as a rise in annual subscription value, an indicator of customer retention.\nLSEG, which suffered outages in February and this month, said its partnership with Microsoft was moving from the pilot stage to \"approaching commercialisation\" as the first product becomes more widely available by year-end.\nThe exchange, transformed into a data powerhouse after its $27 billion acquisition of Refinitiv in 2021, reiterated all medium-term guidance of mid to high single digit organic revenue growth annually, accelerating after this year.\nLSEG shares, which have risen 2.1% so far this year, rose by as much as 4.2% on Thursday to their highest since February 2021, when they traded at a record peak.\n\"We are also delivering efficiency improvements, with underlying margin improving year-on-year despite ongoing investment, and we expect this trend to continue,\" LSEG CEO David Schwimmer, said in a statement.\nGrowth was broad-based, with an \"outstanding\" first half at Tradeweb, the group's bond trading platform.\n\"We look forward to further progress in the second half of the year, and are reiterating all of our medium-term guidance,\" Schwimmer said.\nA shake-up in UK listings rules was also making the LSE a more attractive rival to New York and elsewhere for initial public offerings, he said.\nLSEG's significant enhancements to Workspace, which distributes news and data to customers, has resulted in \"several competitor displacements\", Schwimmer said, adding that the pick-up in taking business from rivals was expected to continue.\nBank of America said it would maintain a 'Buy' rating on the shares as LSEG benefits from \"strong recurring revenues and structural demand for data\".\nLSEG's total income, excluding recoveries, rose 5.4% to 4.204 billion pounds ($5.40 billion), topping an analysts' consensus of 4.195 billion pounds.\nOperating profit in the first half rose 9% to 1.563 billion pounds, with adjusted earnings per share of 174 pence, up 8.1% on the same period last year, both ahead of analysts' consensus estimates collated by LSEG.\nAnnual subscription value, which reflects recurring revenue and is closely watched by analysts, was up 6.4% at June 2024, in line with guidance, and up from 6% in the first quarter.\nIn the first quarter, LSEG said annual subscription value was hit by Swiss bank UBS' forced takeover of Credit Suisse which reduced demand for LSEG products, but the full impact of the Credit Suisse deal is still to come.\nASV will be around 6% for the rest of the year, LSEG said.\n\"All medium-term targets have been reiterated, and we think notably more confident commentary of competitor displacements around Workspace will be taken well,\" analysts at RBC said in a note to clients.\nLSEG said its content agreement with Dow Jones announced in July creates a leading news offering across its platforms.\nLSEG pays Reuters for news.\n($1 = 0.7785 pounds)\n(Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper, editing by Sinead Cruise and Jane Merriman)\n"

        "Title": "Billionaire Lee Cooperman Says The Market Is Expensive But Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Cheap",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Lee Cooperman Says The Market Is Expensive But These 10 Stocks Are Cheap. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other cheap stocks.\nLeon Cooperman recently shared his conservative outlook on the economy and discussed stocks that he is monitoring during a CNBC interview. He believes the U.S. is heading toward a fiscal disaster due to a lack of attention on rising debt. He also noted that nothing seems overvalued if a 10-year bond is valued at the current rate.\n\u201cMy assumption is that we are headed into a fiscal disaster in our country. There's nobody focusing on debt creation in the economy. My second assumption is that nothing is overvalued if a 10-year bond belongs at the current rate of 3.9%.\u201d\nCooperman compared this to the 1972 Nifty Fifty period when government bonds were at 6.5%, and several companies which had high earnings multiples, eventually went bankrupt. He pointed out that these companies, despite their high valuations, were acquired by JP Morgan.\n\u201cIn the Nifty Fifty period of 1972, the government bond went 6.5%, Avon products was 65x earnings, it has declared bankruptcy. Eastman Kodak went bankrupt with 48x earnings. IBM at 37x earnings got bankrupt. These are companies that are actively being bought by JP Morgan in the US trust.\u201d\nCooperman emphasized that with the 10-year bond yield at 3.932%, nothing appears overvalued. He expects interest rates to remain low and anticipates a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, likely by 25 to 50 basis points. He expects that this will lead to a slow positive movement in the yield curve, with the 10-year bond yield increasing and its price declining.\nLeon Cooperman also mentioned that he believes the current environment is more of a \"market of stocks\" rather than a unified stock market. Additionally, he expressed concern about the health insurance sector, noting that these companies are trading at low multiples, even though they have been generating excess capital and buying back their own stock. Cooperman then emphasized that he is motivated by valuation levels when assessing investments.\nLeon Cooperman follows a value-focused investment strategy, concentrating on undervalued stocks and using a top-down approach to select sectors. He combines fundamental analysis with a bottom-up approach to build and manage portfolios. Omega Advisors, which handles over $3.3 billion in assets largely from Cooperman's own wealth, has approximately $4.37 billion under management for seven clients. The firm's Q1 2024 13F filing showed $2.4 billion in managed securities, with its top ten holdings making up 61.09% of the portfolio.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review Leon Cooperman\u2019s latest CNBC interview and highlight ten stocks he owns and mentioned. We also provided analyst ratings, key details about each company, and the number of hedge funds investing in them.\nWhy focus on the stocks that hedge funds invest in? Our research shows that following the top picks of leading hedge funds can result in returns that beat the market. We use this strategy in our quarterly newsletter, where we choose 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks each quarter. Since May 2014, this approach has generated a 275% return, outperforming the benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a top technology company known for its software, cloud services, and cutting-edge solutions. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a major industry player with a wide range of products, including Windows, Office 365, and its strong cloud platform, Azure.\nLeon Cooperman highlighted his investment in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a key technology holding. He noted that while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) may not be cheap, the current market rotation is significant and suggests that the market's optimism, particularly around extreme valuations in top tech stocks, might be overly optimistic.\n\"I own Microsoft. It's my window into technology. While I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a particularly cheap stock, I do believe this market rotation is real. Historically, markets that have experienced rotation often enter a corrective phase. The shift from extreme valuations in the 'Magnificent 7' suggests that something else is at play, and a flat market might be overly optimistic.\"\nFor Q4 FY2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) achieved annual revenue of over $245 billion, marking a 15% increase from the previous year, with cloud revenue growing 23% to exceed $135 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) reached $3.06, surpassing the $2.98 forecast. Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service, saw a 20% revenue increase, reinforcing its top position in the cloud market. The $69 billion acquisition of\nActivision Blizzard, Inc.\n(NASDAQ:ATVI) boosts Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s gaming and entertainment offerings, further integrating these with its cloud services. New releases like Windows 12 and updates to Office 365 show Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s ongoing innovation.\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Strategy trailed the Russell 3000 Index benchmark largely due to our diversified positioning, although we maintain a considerable portfolio allocation to large cap AI-related companies. These positions were indeed among our top contributors in the quarter, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is finding more ways to deploy AI for sustainability objectives such as its ability to better measure, predict and optimize complex systems, which can help its partner communities reduce wildfire risk.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the cheap stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT): Q4 Earnings Reinforce Its Long-Term Potential",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) investors are showing some impatience with the pace of AI development, as evidenced by the negative reaction to the company\u2019s June quarter results. With MSFT now trading at a more depressed valuation, I remain bullish on its long-term prospects, acknowledging that these market reactions appear to be more short-term oriented.\nWhile Microsoft reported strong Fiscal Q4 results, there was a drop in margins and revenue growth, especially in cloud, where AI spending is concentrated. Short-term concerns about AI and CapEx seem exaggerated and likely led some investors to take profits from the stock\u2019s recent gains. Consequently, long-term investors now have the chance to buy MSFT shares at a more attractive valuation.\nOnce again, the company delivered strong results. For the eighth consecutive quarter, Microsoft exceeded EPS estimates, reporting $2.95 compared to the expected $2.94. In terms of revenue, Microsoft also surpassed expectations for the sixth consecutive quarter, with reported revenue of $64.7 billion versus an anticipated $64.4 billion, marking a 15% year-over-year increase.\nDespite these achievements, many market participants were disappointed with Microsoft\u2019s Fiscal Q4 results. Although the gross profit margin was an impressive 70%, it represented a 1% decline from the previous year. While this drop in profitability might seem minimal at first glance, the high expectations set by the 2024 rally in AI and large-cap tech stocks have made investors particularly cautious.\nAs a result, any signs that Microsoft\u2019s profitability could be negatively impacted by AI investments have prompted some investors to take profits. This led to a roughly 4% drop in Microsoft shares following the earnings report. Now, the stock trades at a more de-risked valuation of 30x forward P/E, about 3% below its five-year average.\nMoreover, two additional factors drew negative attention from investors.\nFirst, the growth in commercial bookings was reported at 17% year-over-year, which fell short of the higher acceleration investors had anticipated, despite management seeing growth beyond its expectations. It\u2019s important to consider the tough comparisons from the previous\u00a0quarter, when this segment had recorded 29% year-over-year growth.\nOn a positive note, commercial remaining performance obligations increased by $34 billion from the previous quarter, reaching $269 billion. This indicates that Microsoft has secured contracts that will contribute to future revenue.\nSecond, the performance of the Intelligent Cloud segment, driven by Azure, was another area of disappointment. Server Products and Cloud Services revenue totaled $28.5 billion, reflecting 22% year-over-year growth. However, this figure slightly missed investor expectations because last quarter, Azure had grown by 24% year-over-year.\nThe slowdown in cloud revenue growth is particularly concerning, as competitors like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) have managed to accelerate revenue growth for AWS and Google Cloud, respectively. This suggests that Azure might be lagging behind.\nAn interesting point made by analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson is worth noting. He highlighted that Microsoft\u2019s cloud growth is being driven by AI-related services, which are fueling additional growth. The company is leveraging its AI capabilities to cross-sell other products, such as premium Office products with co-pilot functionality, to enterprises that are using its AI services.\nThe bottom line is that AI remains the key driver for Microsoft. The company holds a significant lead in this area and continues to leverage AI to fuel growth across its business segments.\nCapital expenditures (CapEx) were also a big focus during the Big Tech earnings season. This metric highlights long-term growth plans and the challenge of balancing these goals with the need to stay profitable and meet short-term investor expectations.\nMicrosoft reported CapEx of $19 billion for the last quarter and has forecasted further increases in investment to strengthen its AI capabilities. This rising spending trend has led to growing impatience among investors, especially as profit growth has slowed. Alphabet faced a similar reaction. Despite solid quarterly results, its stock dropped due to concerns over its continued high spending on AI. The same issue applied to Microsoft. Despite strong overall numbers, its stock price declined.\nHowever, it is crucial to note that Microsoft\u2019s CFO, Amy E. Hood, emphasized that these investments will persist as long as there is demand.\nShe stated, \u201cTo meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY \u201925 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY \u201924.\u00a0As a reminder, these expenditures\u00a0are dependent\u00a0on demand signals and adoption of our services\u00a0that\u00a0will be managed\u00a0through\u00a0the year.\u201d\nA primary concern is that half of the spending is allocated to land and financing leases, while the remaining half is invested in servers (which will depreciate quickly). In my opinion, the more concerning scenario would be if management hinted at a slowdown in AI spending, which could indicate a demand issue. Yet, this is clearly not the case here.\nAnalysts are very bullish on MSFT, maintaining a Strong Buy consensus rating. Following the Fiscal Q4 earnings results, five analysts have recently increased their price targets, with the average MSFT stock price target now at $503.19. This implies upside potential of 26.3% from the current share price.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nOn the back of still-great results, though not as outstanding as some wish to be, many Microsoft investors viewed this slight shortfall as an opportunity to sell shares and lock in profits.\nNonetheless, I believe that Microsoft\u2019s bullish thesis remains intact, especially now that its valuation has become more attractive. Despite facing tough comps from previous strong quarters, the company continues to deliver impressive results, with revenues and earnings consistently surpassing expectations. The ongoing investment in AI capabilities indicates that robust demand is still to come. Even with a slight slowdown, Microsoft remains a compelling choice for the long term.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "WPS Office, a suit of cloud-based office software sold by Chinese developer Kingsoft as an alternative to Microsoft Office, was down for hours on Wednesday, disrupting the operations of companies nationwide.\nSocial media reports of the outage began surfacing in the morning, as users took to the internet to complain about difficulties opening, syncing and uploading WPS documents. Others said they experienced network latency when working on files. The topic #WPSCollapse became the fifth trending term on microblogging site Weibo.\nAt 3.33pm, Kingsoft announced on its Weibo account that WPS service had \"resumed after emergency repairs by engineers\", without elaborating on the scope and reason for the breakdown. To placate users, the company is offering everyone a free 15-day membership, to be claimed on Thursday.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe outage is the second one in China this week that involved a major online service. On Monday, NetEase Cloud Music, a music-streaming platform run by video gaming giant NetEase, experienced a widespread service failure that lasted over two hours. In the aftermath, the company gave users a free seven-day subscription.\nWPS Office claims a more than 90 per cent share in mainland China's market for mobile terminals. It is widely used in key sectors such as government departments, financial institutions and telecommunications network operators.\nAs of June, WPS had 271 million monthly active users (MAUs) on desktop and 328 million MAUs on smartphones, according to Kingsoft's financial disclosure.\nFor general users on the mainland, WPS has long been seen as a cheaper alternative to Microsoft Office, although the commercial launch of the first WPS word processor in 1989 predated Microsoft's set-up of a China office in 1992.\nToday, the WPS website still markets its products as being \"highly compatible\" with Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint.\nHowever, WPS has previously been accused of censoring private user documents. In 2022, a Chinese novelist said WPS locked her out of her own work, with the software warning her that \"the file may contain sensitive content\". At the time, WPS said it \"never censors, locks or deletes users' local files\", but added that it \"is obliged to review all content distributed through its platform\" in accordance with Chinese laws.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 17 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and Billionaire Druckenmiller is Betting on AI\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Small-Cap AI Stocks to Buy and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

        "Text": "The massive IT outage caused by Microsoft Corp and CrowdStrike Holdings, which resulted in more than 7,000 flight cancellations at Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, will cost the company some $380 million in direct revenue, the carrier said on Friday.\nIn a filing with the US Securities And Exchange Commission, Ed Bastian, Delta's chief executive officer, said that company is pursuing legal claims against CrowdStrike and Microsoft to recover damages caused by the outage, of at least $500 million.\nOn July 19, the outage hit worldwide operations of major banks, airlines, media outlets, and hospitals, among others, who use Microsoft Windows operating system linked to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. The issue was caused after a defect found in CrowdStrike's single content update for Windows hosts.\nThe faulty software update, behind the \"largest IT outage in history,\" had knocked out around 8.5 million computers globally and resulted in chaos in many major sectors including airline operation, including thousands of flight cancellations.\nThe impact of the outage was extended to many more days, and many US airlines, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Frontier Airlines among others, experiencing issues.\nDelta now said it experienced operational disruption resulting from Microsoft and CrowdStrike-caused outage, causing around 7,000 flight cancellations over five days.\nFor the September quarter, the company now estimates the direct revenue impact of the incident to be $380 million, primarily driven by refunding customers for cancelled flights and providing customer compensation in the form of cash and SkyMiles.\nFurther, non-fuel expenses associated with the technology-driven outage and subsequent operational recovery is estimated at $170 million, primarily due to customer expense reimbursements and crew-related costs.\nDelta also projects fuel expense to be $50 million lower as a result of the 7,000 flight cancellations, which impacted projected year-over-year September quarter 2024 capacity growth by approximately 1.5 points.\nBastian said, \"An operational disruption of this length and magnitude is unacceptable, and our customers and employees deserve better. Since the incident, our people have returned the operation to an industry-leading position that is consistent with the level of performance our customers expect from Delta.\"\nMeanwhile, Delta was under investigation by the US Department of Transportation over the six-day recovery period following the outage, longer than other major airlines.\nEarlier, following criticism from Delta's chief executive regarding the computer issues, CrowdStrike had denied the sole responsibility for the flight disruptions that impacted Delta, strongly refuting any claims of negligence or misconduct.\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 8, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \" The overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week\u2019sEarnings Trends\u00a0report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods,\u00a0please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\nFor the 431 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 86.2% of the index\u2019s total membership, total earnings are up +10.6% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.2% beating revenue estimates.\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.7% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nQ2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +33.5% from the same period last year on +14.3% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.2% (from +11.0%).\nThe \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 have been in the spotlight in the ongoing market turmoil. This followed these companies\u2019 Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market\u2019s issue with the Mag 7 companies\u2019 quarterly reports wasn\u2019t so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don\u2019t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.5% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.5%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. A big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 26, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nSemiconductor and AI leader Nvidia reports earnings next Wednesday, August 28 after the market close and investors are waiting with bated breath. Nvidia's remarkable performance over the past two years is almost unfathomable, yet the company\u2019s expansion appears it should continue at this same rapid pace for years to come.\nHere, we will cover the path Nvidia has taken to get to its current position, what to expect from next week\u2019s earnings report and whether it\u2019s possible for Nvidia to reach a $10 Trillion market capitalization.\nThe results Nvidia has provided its shareholders with over the last 25 years is truly hard to understate. Over that period, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 35.4%, yielding a dizzying 217,000% return. Even more recently, over just the last five years, NVDA stock has compounded at an annual rate of 98.5%, 30xing investor money over that time.\nAt the depths of the 2022 bear market, Nvidia had a market cap of $250 billion; today, it stands at a staggering $3 trillion. The meteoric rise is a direct result of Nvidia\u2019s strategic focus on AI infrastructure through its data center products. Since the pivot, annual sales have nearly quadrupled to $80 billion, and are expected to double again by 2026. Even more impressive is that Nvidia boasts 53% net margins on that revenue.\nFueled by surging demand for AI-driven solutions, Nvidia positioned itself at the heart of the AI revolution. Nvidia\u2019s focus on strategic partnerships with major cloud providers, its continued innovation in AI software (like the CUDA platform), and its ability to foresee the massive potential of generative AI were key to the stock\u2019s unprecedented rally.\nPartnering with fellow tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet has been the primary driver of its growth. Because Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet run massive cloud computing operations, and much AI development will occur in the cloud they have plowed tens of billion into Capex spending. While this is hugely beneficial to Nvidia, it is also good for all three major cloud providers. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft add more power users to their platforms and Nvidia sells them the hardware.\nIf we look at the current quarter earnings forecasts, we can put into perspective the incredible pace that Nvidia continues to grow both the top and bottom line. Sales for the quarter are expected to grow 110% year over year (YoY) to $28.2 billion, while earnings are projected to climb 133% YoY to $0.63 per share. Looking further out, the expectations are equally impressive.\nAlthough Nvidia had sat atop the Zacks Rank for nearly two years, as analysts were continuously upgrading earnings estimates, today it has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, which most definitely isn\u2019t a negative thing. There is nothing bearish about a rank #3, just simply that earnings estimates haven\u2019t been upgraded recently.\nIt isn\u2019t just possible, it\u2019s likely Nvidia will reach a market cap of $10 trillion within the next five years based on current forecasts. Today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 48.9x, which is well below its five-year median of 55x. Incredibly, Nvidia has grown so fast that even though the stock price is up 20x in the last five years, it is still close to its cheapest relative valuation because of the incredible profit growth.\nTo get to the conclusion that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion is of course quite speculative, however a simple extrapolation shows how it is not an unreasonable expectation. Earnings are forecast to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, and if the stock grows at that pace while maintaining its current earnings multiple, it would be there in under five years.\nFor investors seeking exposure to AI and high-growth tech, Nvidia remains among the most compelling options. Despite the incredible run-up in its stock price, the company\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and unmatched growth rates suggest that Nvidia could still have significant upside potential.\nAt its core, Nvidia is positioned to remain a key player in the AI revolution, with its GPUs powering the future of AI-driven industries. The company\u2019s focus on continuous innovation and its partnerships with major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet provide a strong foundation for future growth.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s valuation is relatively high, it is backed by extraordinary earnings growth that is expected to continue at a rapid pace. The company's potential to reach a $10 trillion market cap underscores its long-term growth trajectory, making it an attractive investment for those with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term perspective.\nIn conclusion, Nvidia's stock may be a buy for investors who believe in the future of AI and are willing to weather short-term market volatility in exchange for long-term gains. With its leadership in the AI space and strong earnings growth projections, Nvidia could continue to reward investors as it moves toward new milestones.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Microsoft and These 2 Growth Stocks Aren't Passive Income Powerhouses Yet, but They Continue to Raise Their Dividends at a Rapid Rate",
        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One drawback of investing in growth stocks is that they tend to pay small dividends or no dividends at all. The idea is to reinvest capital into the business to grow its value rather than give investors the temporary benefit of a dividend payment. However, there's a limit to how much reinvestment is needed before it becomes borderline wasteful. That's why many growth companies take a more balanced approach to their capital return programs.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Visa (NYSE: V) are good examples of former up-and-coming growth companies that have matured and no longer need to pour every ounce of excess profit back into their businesses. Despite their low yields, all three companies are highly committed to their dividends. Here's why they are all buys now.\nMicrosoft has steadily increased its dividend, with annual dividend raises typically around 10% and the dividend nearly tripling in the last 10 years. Microsoft's annual dividend expense is now over $21 billion -- but it can easily afford it.\nMicrosoft's payout ratio is just 25% -- meaning that for every dollar in earnings per share (EPS), around $0.25 is going toward dividends per share. That's an affordable expense, especially for a company like Microsoft that has an extremely healthy balance sheet with more cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities than debt.\nStock repurchases have also been a core aspect of Microsoft's capital return program. Despite a growing stock-based compensation expense, the company has reduced its outstanding share count by 10% over the last decade thanks to buybacks. However, there's been a noticeable shift in Microsoft's capital return strategy over the last year or so.\nMicrosoft is pulling back on buybacks to accelerate capital expenditures as it ramps up spending on product improvements and artificial intelligence (AI) investments. In the following chart, you can see that its stock buybacks are down about 50% compared to a couple of years ago, while its capex has rocketed higher.\nThe beauty of Microsoft's capital allocation strategy is that it can use buybacks as a lever to pull on when it needs more cash to invest in growth, or it can slow down on growth when there isn't a compelling opportunity. And yet, it still can buy back enough stock to more than offset stock-based compensation -- thereby avoiding dilution.\nThe key takeaway here is that Microsoft is so profitable it can afford a massive and steadily growing dividend while still investing in growth. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.8,\u00a0Microsoft isn't a particularly expensive stock either -- especially relative to some of its megacap growth peers.\nBroadcom's dividend has increased around fivefold in the span of just seven years. It has emerged as arguably the best dividend-paying semiconductor stock as it passes along profits directly to shareholders. But that doesn't mean Broadcom is taking its foot off the gas when it comes to growth.\nBroadcom makes a variety of hardware components for storage and systems, wireless and wired connectivity, mainframe and enterprise software, cybersecurity, and more. It benefits from increased investment in global connectivity and the need for greater computing power to support AI models. In this vein, Broadcom isn't a pure-play AI stock. It was doing just fine before the recent surge in AI investment. However, Broadcom's sales of AI chips are soaring, which could lead to AI being a larger share of its revenue mix going forward.\nIn addition to its balanced business and growing dividend, Broadcom is also not overpriced -- with a forward P/E ratio of 28.7. Broadcom yields 1.5%,\u00a0\u00a0which may not sound like much, but it's actually higher than the S&P 500's yield of 1.3%. What's more, Broadcom's low yield is more a result of its outperforming stock price than a lack of dividend raises. Broadcom is up nearly threefold in the last three years. Without that gain, the yield would be over 4%.\nAdd it all up, and Broadcom is a great way to invest in AI without paying up for a stock with a nosebleed valuation.\nVisa is another great example of a company that has evolved into a balance of growth, income, and value. Visa has increased its dividend for 16 consecutive years -- with the dividend up 420% over the last decade. Despite the rapid increases, Visa's yield is just 0.8% -- again largely due to an outperforming stock price.\nBut as impressive as Visa's dividend raises have been, they're far from the only way the company returns capital to shareholders. Visa has reduced its outstanding share count by 21% over the last decade. The following chart showcases multiple reasons why Visa has been such a winning investment over this time period -- with the stock up nearly 400% paired with a growing capital return program.\nWhile it's hard to dispute the strength of Visa's track record, investors care more about where a company is headed than where it has been. And fortunately for Visa investors, the company's position looks stronger than ever.\nVisa charges merchants fees when Visa credit and debit cards are used to make a transaction.Although Visa benefits from higher spending, it isn't a cyclical stock in the same way as a company that depends heavily on the economic cycle and capital investment.\nIt's also worth noting that Visa is extremely resistant to inflation -- and if anything, benefits from it because inflation means higher nominal spending. And it's unlikely Visa's costs would increase at the same rate.\nBut Visa also benefits from lower interest rates, which spur economic growth.\nIn sum, Visa wins when money changes hands in higher dollar amounts.\nVisa has also capitalized on the transition from cash to mobile and digital payments, as well as digital currency conversions as opposed to cash conversions.\nVisa's near-perfect business shows no signs of slowing. And best of all, the stock is not overpriced, with a P/E ratio of 27.5.\nMicrosoft, Broadcom, and Visa are vastly different businesses, but they are remarkably similar stocks. All three companies can afford to dividends without compromising their growth prospects. Given their solid fundamentals and industry-leading positions, all three stocks also sport reasonable valuations.\nAll told, Microsoft, Broadcom, and Visa are on the right track to becoming passive income powerhouses and are worth buying for investors interested in top companies without the ultra-premium price tag.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Prediction: 1 Unstoppable Stock Will Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club Within 3 Years",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has produced the world's most valuable companies for over a century. United States Steel became the first company to achieve a $1 billion valuation in 1901, and 117 years later, Apple became the first company to surpass a valuation of $1 trillion.\nApple was also the first company to cross the $2 trillion and $3 trillion thresholds. Only three other U.S. companies -- Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet \u2014 are valued at more than $2 trillion as of this writing, but I think one more is set to join them.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp, but it's also becoming a serious contender in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Meta is using AI to improve monetization on its social platforms, but it also developed the world's most advanced open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama.\nHere's how Meta could achieve a $2 trillion valuation within three years, and if it does, investors who buy the stock today could earn a 67% return.\nMeta serves over 3.2 billion people across its family of apps every single day. Social networks like Facebook and Instagram used to focus on connecting users with their friends and family, but they have transformed into entertainment platforms with AI-powered recommendation engines ensuring everybody sees the most relevant content, even if it wasn't posted by someone they know.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg says this shift is increasing the amount of time users spend on Meta's platforms, which means they view more ads and, therefore, become more valuable to the company. Speaking of which, Meta continues to develop AI tools for advertisers, too, which can help them create the most engaging content and target the most relevant audience.\nEventually, Zuckerberg says businesses will be able to tell Meta their objective and their budget, and its AI engine will autonomously handle the entire process for them \u2014 from crafting the creative to selecting the target audience. That's a game changer, because it means even the smallest business with no marketing team can yield the best possible return from its ad dollars.\nBut it gets better. Meta released a chatbot called Meta AI last year that can answer questions on most topics and even generate images on demand. It paves the way for Business AI, which could be a substantial revenue driver in the future. Zuckerberg believes every business will have its own AI agent trained to handle incoming queries from customers on Messenger and WhatsApp, for example, and even process sales. That will facilitate around-the-clock service even when the business owner is unavailable.\nLlama is the LLM that powers the exciting AI features I just mentioned. It's open-source, because Zuckerberg believes a widely deployed model used by thousands of developers will improve at a much faster rate than if Meta did all of the testing and troubleshooting alone.\nMeta just released Llama 3.1, and with 405 billion parameters, it's the most advanced version so far. Zuckerberg says Llama 3 is already competitive with most leading models, but he's focused on developing Llama 4, which he believes will set the standard for the industry next year.\nTraining Llama 4 will require up to 10 times the data center compute capacity compared to Llama 3, which means it will likely cost tens of billions of dollars in new infrastructure. I'll talk more about the cost in a moment, but better LLMs will result in more advanced user-facing AI applications, so Meta will have to invest heavily if it wants to stay ahead of the pack.\nOtherwise, users might spend more time on OpenAI's ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini instead of Meta AI, which could hurt the company's ability to generate revenue.\nMeta generated $39 billion in revenue during Q2, which was a 22% increase from the year-ago period. But the company's bottom line is the real story, because it continues to benefit from the cost-cutting measures enacted since late 2022. They involved 21,000 job cuts and a commitment from Zuckerberg to spend more cautiously on projects like the metaverse, which generate minimal revenue.\nAs a result, Meta's Q2 net income soared 73% year over year to $13.4 billion. That followed three straight quarters of triple-digit percentage growth.\nThe result was especially impressive when you consider the speed with which Meta is ramping up its capital expenditures for AI. It allocated $8.4 billion toward capex during Q2, which was up from the $6.3 billion it spent during the first quarter.\nMeta CFO Susan Li told investors capex could hit $40 billion for the whole of 2024, so spending appears set to accelerate in the second half of the year. Plus, Li forecasts \"significant\" growth in capex in 2025.\nNearly all of that money will go toward data center infrastructure, servers, and chips to accelerate the development of LLMs like Llama 4, which will bring new user-facing AI applications to life.\nBased on Meta's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $19.59 and its current stock price of around $488, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.9. That means it would have to rise 23% just to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 30.6. That alone would lift Meta's market cap to almost $1.5 trillion.\nBut Meta is even cheaper when measured against its future earnings. Wall Street expects the company to generate $23.93 in earnings per share during 2025, placing the stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 20.4. If that forecast is accurate and Meta's P/E ratio also rises to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 by the end of next year, that will place its valuation at $1.8 trillion.\nThat implies Meta will only have to grow its earnings per share by 11% in 2026 to warrant a $2 trillion valuation. Considering the company grew its earnings at a compound annual rate of almost 30% in the decade between 2014 and 2023, I say there is a very good chance it delivers.\nPlus, there is a strong possibility that AI is a more powerful tailwind for Meta than analysts expect right now. The company's growing portfolio of AI tools \u2014 especially for businesses \u2014 could drive up marketing spending and also pull ad dollars away from its competitors. There is no telling how big that opportunity might become.\nEven if it doesn't get there within three years, I think Meta has a clear path to join the $2 trillion club eventually.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The mad dash to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) began in earnest early last year, driving impressive gains for those companies best positioned to profit from this sea change in technology. The resulting bull run among AI stocks has helped sustain the ongoing market rally.\nIn recent weeks, however, some investors have begun to get skittish, wondering how long this relentless run could go on and looking for evidence the AI revolution was intact. Results from the poster child of AI, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), provided some answers.\nWith that as a backdrop, chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) jumped 6.7%, software and cloud specialist Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) rallied 2.3%, and AI chip specialist Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) climbed 2.1% as of 12:32 p.m. ET on Thursday.\nA check of all the usual sources -- changes to analysts' ratings, earnings results, and regulatory filings -- turned up nothing in the way of company-specific news that helped fuel gains for stocks in the space. That said, there was one obvious catalyst that helped spark a relief rally for AI stocks.\nChipmaker Nvidia released its quarterly financial report after market close yesterday, and by most measures, the results were superb.\nFor its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia generated revenue of $30 billion, up 122% year over year and 15% sequentially. This produced adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.68, which surged 152% year over year and 11% sequentially. For context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $28.7 billion and EPS of $0.64, so Nvidia surpassed expectations on both counts.\nThat said, there were a couple of areas of note that investors may have had concerns about.\nFor the upcoming third quarter, the company is forecasting revenue of $32.5 billion, an increase of 80% year over year. While results of that magnitude would normally be cause for celebration, it's a deceleration for the triple-digit year-over-year growth Nvidia has generated for the past five quarters.\nAnother area being closely watched is Nvidia's gross margin. While the measure -- which clocked in at 75.1% -- was still historically high, it was down from the 78.4% the company delivered last quarter. Management chalked that up to inventory provisions for its Blackwell processors and product mix, but investors hate uncertainty.\nThose small quibbles aside, Nvidia's results provide sufficient evidence that the adoption of AI is continuing at a brisk pace, which bodes well for other companies impacted by the secular tailwinds of AI.\nThere's little question that generative AI has the potential to be transformational. These systems tend to automate mundane, time-consuming tasks, thereby increasing productivity. Our trio of stocks is each heavily invested in the success of AI:\nArm Holdings created the blueprints for the state-of-the-art CPU cores included in processors created by Nvidia and others, and are a critical element in AI systems.\nMicrosoft was one of the first movers in the AI software space, creating Copilot, an AI-powered digital assistant deeply integrated into its cloud and software systems, designed to streamline processes, thereby saving time and money.\nBroadcom creates many of the semiconductors and other technology used in data centers and cloud computing.\nThese companies can't all be painted with the same brush, as they each have a unique contribution to the AI ecosystem. That said, some investors view them as a part of the broader AI revolution.\nDespite the recent uncertainty, these stocks still boast lofty valuations and are not for the faint of heart. Arm Holdings, Broadcom, and Microsoft are selling for 85 times, 34 times, and 32 times forward earnings, respectively. Of the three, Microsoft and Broadcom are the least expensive, but all three are deserving of a premium befitting their position in the industry and the opportunity represented by AI. Investors merely need to decide how high a price they're willing to pay.\nDevelopers are only now coming to grips with the potential uses of AI, and new applications are being discovered almost every day. Investors would do well to buy the best AI stocks they can find and hang on for dear life.\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jenna Philpott ",
        "Text": "Microsoft and digital pathology developer Paige have unveiled the second generation of Virchow, an image-based AI model for digital pathology and oncology.\nThe updated versions of their AI model, dubbed Virchow2 and Virchow2G, feature significant improvements in size, data diversity, and performance.\nVirchow2G \u2013 the largest model \u2013 boasts 1.8 million parameters, allowing for deeper cancer analysis.\nThe tools are designed to help doctors find and diagnose cancer more quickly and accurately. According to the companies, the model can analyse more than 40 types of tissue samples, making it easier for doctors to spot rarer cancers.\nThese new models have been trained on pathology slides from over three million samples sourced from 800 labs. The dataset includes information from more than 225,000 patients, covering a wide range of demographics, said the companies.\nMicrosoft and Paige teamed up in September 2023 to develop the original Virchow model, which was trained using data from around 100,000 patients. A study published in Nature Medicine in July 2024 showed that Virchow detects 16 cancer types as well or better than tissue-specific clinical-grade models. This comprised nine common and seven rare tumours.\nPaige was the first company to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a clinical AI application in digital pathology. The New York, US-headquartered company raised $100m in a 2021 Series C funding round led by Casdin Capital and Johnson & Johnson Innovation.\nPaige's technology senior vice president Razik Yousfi said: \u201cThis second generation of Paige\u2019s Virchow model outperforms anything in the industry and continues to grow in knowledge and capability, bringing us closer to making precision medicine a reality.\n\u201cWe are not only expanding capabilities, increasing accuracy, and reducing time in the cancer diagnosis process but also pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\u201d\nIn March 2024, Microsoft partnered with data-driven diagnostics company Cyted to build AI models to improve the early detection of oesophageal cancer. The AI-supported methods have demonstrated diagnostic performance on par with the current manual workflow, potentially reducing up to 63% of pathologists\u2019 workloads.\nAccording to a report on GlobalData\u2019s Medical Intelligence Center, AI in the medical market was worth $336m in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.1% to $1.2bn by 2027.\n\"Microsoft and Paige unveil updated AI model for cancer diagnostics \" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the most notable transitions in recent decades has been the ascent of technology purveyors among the world's most valuable companies. It was just two decades ago that industrial and energy stalwarts General Electric and ExxonMobil\u00a0topped the list in terms of market cap, valued at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just 20 years later, it's technology that dominates the list.\nLeading the way are three of the most recognizable tech companies in the world. Apple currently tops the list at $3.4 trillion. Microsoft and Nvidia are close behind, each valued of $3 trillion.\nWith a market cap of just $1.3 trillion, it might seem premature to suggest that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is on track to join the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 163% over the past year and 495% over the past five years (as of this writing), driven by strong operating results that should continue.\nMeta has several distinct advantages, and its ever-expanding social media empire, market dominance, and strategic adoption of AI could drive its membership in this elite fraternity.\nWhile Meta Platforms was punished during the economic downturn, the stock has come roaring back, propelled higher by impressive financial results. In the second quarter, revenue of $39 billion climbed 22% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 jumped 73%.\nThe financial results were driven by solid user metrics. The number of people who paid daily visits one of Meta's family of social media sites -- which includes Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp -- grew to 3.27 billion, up 7% year over year.\nHelping fuel the robust results was the ongoing rebound in online marketing, which is improving thanks to gains in the overall economy. Meta's social media ecosystem plays host to the company's digital advertising.\nThe online ad arena is dominated by the industry's two leading players. In 2023, Alphabet's Google controlled an estimated 39% of the worldwide digital ad revenue, followed by Meta with 18%, according to data compiled by business intelligence platform Statista.\nAs the world's second-largest digital advertiser, Meta Platforms is well positioned to reap the benefits of the rebound, which could be substantial.\nWorldwide ad spending is expected to rise by 8% to more than $1 trillion in 2024, according to ad industry researcher WARC Media. Social media is expected to be the fastest-growing medium in digital advertising, capturing nearly 22% of total ad spending, according to the report. It goes on to say that Meta is \"on course to record oversized gains in the coming months.\"\nBeyond advertising, however, is Meta's strategy to profit from the windfall of artificial intelligence (AI). The company has leveraged the data it captures from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its own state-of-the-art large language models, which forms the foundation of generative AI.\nThe result is Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI), which feeds its flagship Meta AI chatbot. Earlier this year, the company unveiled Llama 3, declaring Meta AI as \"one of the world's leading AI assistants.\" The company made this system free to individual users (collecting even more data) while it charges the largest cloud infrastructure providers for the privilege of including it in their offerings.\nWhile there's a great deal of emphasis on AI, it isn't the only growth driver that could push Meta higher. Meta's Reality Labs -- home of its Oculus virtual reality (VR) business, Quest VR headsets, and its ever-changing metaverse blueprint -- has had little to show for its efforts thus far. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is convinced these investments will bear fruit, ultimately boosting Meta's profits.\nGiven the rebounding ad market, multiple growth drivers, and the tailwinds driving generative AI, it shouldn't take long for Meta Platforms to earn its membership in the $3 trillion club.\nMeta currently boasts a market cap of roughly $1.35 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 123% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Meta is expected to generate revenue of $161.6 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Meta would have to grow its revenue to roughly $360 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Meta of 14% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2031. It's worth noting that Meta has grown its annual revenue by nearly 1,000% over the past decade, so those expectations could well be conservative.\nFurthermore, at 27 times earnings, Meta is selling for a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500. That's an attractive price to pay for a company with a dominant market share, strong momentum, and multiple ways to win.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-08-19, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $393.21. It's currently trading at a price of $418.47. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -6.42%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.82\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.87%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 19.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n191.78\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n201.43\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n393.21\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $225.25. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -85.78%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The company had 26.5 per cent of the blockchain-as-a-service market in China in 2023, while rival Tencent Holdings was the second-largest provider with 18 per cent of the market, according to a report by research firm IDC in July.\nAnt established Zan in Hong Kong to expand its blockchain services outside mainland China, according to Zhang.\n\"AntChain had already made it to the top in mainland China's blockchain market,\" Zhang said. \"Setting up an entity in Hong Kong gives us more freedom to explore, given the city's [supportive] policy guidance and environment.\"\nMainland China is relatively conservative about certain Web3 innovations, and Ant hopes to do more \"forward-looking\" things in Hong Kong's \"open environment\", he added.\nThe Chinese government has over the years ramped up its crackdown on cryptocurrencies - the main use case of blockchain technology today - saying that they disrupt economic and financial order and are a breeding ground for criminal activity.\nHong Kong, meanwhile, has been pushing to develop into a virtual asset hub and attract business to the city, with tacit approval from Beijing.\nAlibaba's domestic e-commerce rival JD.com also created a Hong Kong subsidiary this year, named Jingdong Coinlink, which participated in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)'s stablecoin sandbox that launched in July.\nAnt Digital Technologies is among the participants in the HKMA's wholesale central bank digital currency sandbox announced on Thursday, which explores tokenisation across a range of scenarios.\nThe company is involved in sandbox projects that tokenise electric vehicle charging stations and electronic bills of lading, a document used in the global shipping industry.\n\"The trading of tokenised assets and funds on the blockchain has a similar technical model to that of public blockchains today, but it is in a more regulated and secure environment, where you won't lose money because of a private key,\" Zhang said.\n\"That makes it more user-friendly for the general public.\"\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 15, 2024\u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% in the first quarter of 2022.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of a stable and improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% in the first quarter of 2022.\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.3% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nThe Q3 negative revisions trend is far bigger than what we had seen in the comparable periods of the preceding two quarters. Estimates have come down for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Energy, Medical, Transportation, and Business Services sectors. Estimates for the Tech and Finance sectors have gone up.\nThe 'Magnificent 7' stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 were in the spotlight in the recent market turmoil. This followed these companies' Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market's issue with the Mag 7 companies' quarterly reports wasn't so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don't see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.4% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.6%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year's record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector's productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year's +8.1% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +7.8%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year's earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Invest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Microsoft Corp",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-08-05, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $393.21. It's currently trading at a price of $408.49. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -3.89%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.82\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.74%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 19.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n191.78\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n201.43\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n393.21\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $225.25. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -81.35%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Microsoft is joining cybersecurity software firm CrowdStrike in fighting back against Delta Air Lines, which blames the companies for causing several thousand canceled flights following a technology outage last month.\nA lawyer for Microsoft said Tuesday that Delta's key IT system is probably serviced by other technology companies, not Microsoft Windows.\n\u201cYour letter and Delta\u2019s public comments are incomplete, false, misleading, and damaging to Microsoft and its reputation,\u201d Microsoft lawyer Mark Cheffo said in a letter to Delta attorney David Boies.\nCheffo said Microsoft was trying to determine \u201cwhy other airlines were able to fully restore business operations so much faster than Delta.\u201d\nThe comments represent an escalating fight between the tech companies and the Atlanta-based airline.\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian said last week that the global technology outage that started with a faulty upgrade from CrowdStrike to machines running on Microsoft Windows cost the airline $500 million. Bastian raised the threat of legal action.\nOn Tuesday, Delta said it has a long record of investing in reliable service including \u201dbillions of dollars in IT capital expenditures\u201d since 2016 and billions more in annual IT costs. It declined further comment.\nCrowdStrike has also disputed Delta\u2019s claims. Both it and Microsoft said Delta had turned down their offers to help the airline recover from the outage last month. Microsoft's lawyer said CEO Satya Nadella emailed Bastian during the outage, but the Delta CEO never replied.\n"

        "Author": "  Kris Cooper ",
        "Text": "Microsoft is now holding all employees accountable for security, with a failure to be proactive impacting promotion and pay rise opportunities.\nIn an internal memo obtained by The Verge, Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft\u2019s chief people officer shared that due to security becoming a \"core priority\" for the company, all employees will be expected to prioritise security as it becomes a focus in employee performance review conversations.\nHogan\u2019s memo outlined that employees should not view security as merely a \u201ccheck-the-box compliance exercise\u201d as staff will now be held accountable, with proactive actions concerning security being codified and reviewed.\nUnderscoring the importance of security for the company, Hogan stated: \"When faced with a trade-off, the answer is clear and simple: security above all else.\u201d\nThe memo details that all employees will set the Security Core Priority as a part of their 2025 Connect which will involve regular conversations with managers on employee progress in prioritising security.\nConnect is Microsoft\u2019s term for employee performance conversations and implies that security, alongside the company's other key priorities of diversity and inclusion, is now a requirement for these conversations.\nThe memo is said to emphasise the need for employees to go above and beyond to integrate security into every facet of their work.\nThis ensures, staff will held accountable for actions they take in enhancing or maintain Microsoft's security, with regular opportunities for their efforts to be reviewed and discussed.\nAccording to The Verge, Microsoft\u2019s internal FAQ page implies that if employees fail to prioritise security, it could impact promotions, pay raises and bonuses.\nEmployees will have to record and capture how they have prioritised security in their work, with technical employees having to incorporate security into their design protocols as they begin a project.\nFor a company such as Microsoft, which is integrated operationally in many of the world\u2019s critical systems, being vigilant against cybersecurity must be among its top priorities.\nIn May 2024, the company announced that senior executive compensation will also depend on progress and actions contributing to security.\nThis more recent update, thus doubles down on the security emphasis, by now calling on every member of staff to be proactive in regards to security or risk losing out on promotions.\nHogan reminded employees of Microsoft\u2019s position as a company: \u201cWe are here because our customers trust us, and we must continue to earn their trust every day\u201d.\n\"Microsoft links security protocols to employee promotion, according to internal memo\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

In fact, Microsoft is the only company currently in the top 10 to rank on any of the three dates before 2021.\nIn reading this note, we were reminded of the exercise Warren Buffett did at the top of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting back in 2021, when he looked at how the world's 20 biggest companies had changed over the prior 30 years.\n\"It is a reminder of what extraordinary things can happen,\" Buffett said back in 2021. \"The world can change, and [in] very, very dramatic ways.\"\nSince 2009, there's been 90% turnover among the world's 10 biggest companies. Fifteen years ago, there were four companies from China in the top 10. Today, there are none.\nApple (AAPL), currently the world's largest company, didn't appear on BofA's rankings until its 2021 edition. (In 2014, Apple was the world's largest company; by 2018, it had become the first US company to see its market value cross $1 trillion.)\nOf course, had BofA chosen to select an intermediate date between 2009 and 2021 \u2014 say, the stock market's high in the summer of 2015 that wouldn't be overtaken for a year \u2014 the list wouldn't be quite as dramatically different: Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) would all feature in the rankings. But still, those would be the only three holdovers from nine years ago.\nConcentration in the stock market has also changed dramatically over time. In 2009, the top 10 companies in the world accounted for about 10% of global market cap; today, that ratio is closer to 25%.\nLooking at 2000, 2007, and 2021, however, we see concentration looks more similar \u2014 though still less extreme \u2014 than today. The world's 10 biggest companies accounted for 17%, 11.6%, and 21.2% of global market in each of those years, respectively.\nSo not only has the market become significantly more tech-forward and US-centric, but also more concentrated.\nWhether an investor sees these past and present states of play as good, bad, or indifferent is what makes a market. The numbers simply tell us what is.\nBut that only Microsoft has maintained its place among the global elite over the last quarter century tells us what is most likely to happen over the next 25 years.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

The world's 10 biggest companies accounted for 17%, 11.6%, and 21.2% of global market in each of those years, respectively.\nSo not only has the market become significantly more tech-forward and US-centric, but also more concentrated.\nWhether an investor sees these past and present states of play as good, bad, or indifferent is what makes a market. The numbers simply tell us what is.\nBut that only Microsoft has maintained its place among the global elite over the last quarter century tells us what is most likely to happen over the next 25 years.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"
