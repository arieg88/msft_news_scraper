        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) announced its second quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion, beating expectations of adjusted EPS of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion.\nThe beats, however, failed to completely satisfy investors, as the stock moved about 1% lower in premarket trading Wednesday.\nMicrosoft's all-important cloud revenue topped out at $33.7 billion, beating estimates of $32.2 billion. The company's Intelligent Cloud business, which includes its Azure service, came in at $25.8 billion versus expectations of $25.3 billion. According to the company, AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, increasing from 3 percentage points last quarter.\n\"We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\u201d\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft\u2019s market capitalization over $3 trillion.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.\nOn the productivity side of things, Microsoft\u2019s Productivity and Business Processes revenue hit $19.25 billion, just ahead of estimates of $19.03 billion. The company\u2019s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, generated $16.89 billion.\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot\u2019s more advanced features.\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently after users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos.\nStill, it\u2019s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it\u2019s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is back on top of the tech world these days, but it's easy to forget that the company was left in the hinterlands for much of this century. While Microsoft was an early pioneer in personal computing with operating systems like DOS and then Windows, it missed the mobile transition, falling behind Apple after the iPhone was released.\nA decade ago, Microsoft was regarded as a laggard in technology, known for a lack of innovation and underperforming the stock market, though it continued to generate profits from its entrenched personal computing and enterprise software ecosystem.\nHowever, its legacy of underperformance changed when Satya Nadella took over as CEO nearly 10 years ago on Feb. 4, 2014.\nNadella overhauled Microsoft philosophically and strategically. He ended the company's war against Apple, allowing Microsoft Office products to be used on Apple devices. Nadella also invested heavily in Microsoft Azure, the company's cloud infrastructure business, which has grown to become the company's biggest profit driver. Azure is now the second-largest cloud infrastructure business behind Amazon Web Services, though it's growing significantly faster than its larger rival.\nThe Microsoft chief has made key acquisitions like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard, diversifying the company and strengthening its pipeline upstream and downstream in areas like advertising and open-source code development. However, Nadella's biggest coup now seems to be the partnership he forged with OpenAI, of which Microsoft now owns nearly 50%. That partnership has made Microsoft a leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and OpenAI's technology has been incorporated across a range of products including Azure, its Office software suite, Bing search, and others.\nThat's helped make Microsoft a winner in 2023, and since Nadella took over, the stock gained 934%, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin as the chart below shows.\nAccording to those results, $10,000 invested in Microsoft when Nadella took the helm would now be worth $123,000 with dividends reinvested or $103,400 without dividends. That would give you a compound annual return of 29% with dividends reinvested or 27% without, which is roughly triple the historical average of the S&P 500 with dividends reinvested. That's a pretty stellar track record over a decade.\nBy comparison, Microsoft stock increased just 34% in the decade before then, which compared to a 55% gain in the S&P 500 as that decade included the crash during the financial crisis.\nNadella's record as Microsoft's CEO shows the power of a CEO to breathe new life into a company. The CEO is ultimately responsible for corporate strategy, capital allocation, and other key decisions, and a bad CEO like predecessor Steve Ballmer can be equally damaging.\nLeadership could be especially important these days in the tech industry as the AI revolution takes off. Though each company competing in the generative AI race comes with a different set of strengths, the choices and investments that CEOs like Satya Nadella are making could make a difference in billions of profits over the long term.\nNadella has also succeeded in making Microsoft much more resilient than it was a decade ago thanks to the growth of its Azure cloud infrastructure business, the integration of its Office suite in Apple products, and acquisitions like LinkedIn and GitHub. That diversification also gives the company an advantage over its big tech rivals as it can deploy new generative AI across a wide range of products.\nMicrosoft stock jumped more than 50% in 2023, and its valuation has gotten a bit expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 36.\nHowever, Microsoft executed effectively in 2023, and it strengthened its competitive advantages by incorporating its new AI Copilot into a wide range of products, including its office productivity software.\nDemand for those products should continue to ramp up in 2024, and Microsoft investors are in good hands with Nadella -- especially as the company continues to leverage its partnership with OpenAI, which also gives it an edge in AI.\nAlthough the stock might be pricey, Microsoft's stock still looks like a smart buy in 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) charged sharply higher in 2023, soaring 57%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The rally was in sharp contrast to Microsoft's performance in 2022 when the stock plunged 29%.\nWhile the improving economic landscape no doubt helped fuel the rise, the biggest contributor to Microsoft's impressive gains was the game-changing rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n2023 kicked off with buzz surrounding the capabilities of ChatGPT, the brainchild of OpenAI. Soon after its release, the chatbot quickly became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, attracting 100 million active users just two months after its debut.\nMicrosoft had made an initial investment of $1 billion in the company back in 2019, but the ability of generative AI to create original content and streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks was revolutionary. Microsoft reportedly boosted its stake to $13 billion while integrating AI across a wide swath of its products and services -- thus serving as the catalyst for the AI gold rush that followed.\nThese capabilities led directly to the development of Copilot, a digital assistant designed to interact with Microsoft's core productivity programs to save users time and make them even more productive. Copilot could summarize emails and draft responses, outline meetings, search spreadsheets for items that met specific criteria, create presentations in PowerPoint, and even draft and review computer code.\nCopilot was a hit with Microsoft users, with roughly 40% of Fortune 100 companies participating in the company's early access, or \"pilot\" program. In an interview late last year, CFO Amy Hood said, \"The next-generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.\"\nMost recently, Microsoft's Azure Cloud reaped the benefits of the company's AI moves, as its cloud revenue grew 29% year over year, outpacing both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which grew 12% and 22%, respectively. This was all the more remarkable since it followed seven consecutive quarters of decelerating year-over-year growth for Azure. Perhaps more importantly, the company attributed the acceleration to AI, with \"roughly three points\" of its cloud growth resulting from accelerating demand for AI services.\nThere could be more to come for Microsoft. While the company demonstrated resilience in the face of the downturn, its PC segment has only just begun to rebound. Furthermore, we haven't yet seen the full extent of Copilot adoption on Microsoft's results, which will no doubt ramp over time. Evercore IS analyst Kirk Materne suggests that AI could generate incremental revenue of more than $100 billion for Microsoft by 2027. For context, Microsoft generated revenue of roughly $212 billion in fiscal 2023 (which ended June 30), so this represents a significant opportunity.\nIts large base of productivity software users and Azure cloud customers gives Microsoft a vast, untapped market to peddle its AI wares. As such, 2023's gains could be just the beginning. Microsoft stock is a buy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nOn January 30, 2024, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) released its 8-K filing, announcing its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The company, a leader in the development and licensing of consumer and enterprise software, is known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite. Microsoft operates through three broad segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing.\nThe second quarter results were particularly strong, with revenue reaching $62.0 billion, an 18% increase year-over-year. This growth was driven by a 33% increase in operating income to $27.0 billion and a 33% rise in net income to $21.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share also saw a significant increase, rising by 33% to $2.93. The acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. on October 13, 2023, has been integrated into the More Personal Computing segment, contributing to the segment's revenue growth.\nMicrosoft's performance this quarter underscores the importance of its cloud services, with Microsoft Cloud revenue surging to $33.7 billion, a 24% increase year-over-year. This growth is a testament to the company's successful pivot towards cloud computing, which is a critical area in the software industry. However, the company must continue to innovate and compete in a market where cloud services are becoming increasingly commoditized.\nChairman and CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the company's progress in AI, stating,\nWeve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.\"\nThis focus on AI is crucial as it represents the next frontier in technology, where Microsoft is positioning itself as a leader.\nMicrosoft's financial achievements this quarter are significant, not only because of the impressive growth rates but also because they reflect the company's ability to monetize its cloud offerings effectively. The integration of AI across Microsoft's tech stack is expected to attract new customers and drive productivity gains across various sectors. The strong execution by sales teams and partners, as noted by Executive Vice President and CFO Amy Hood, has been pivotal in driving revenue growth.\nKey metrics from the income statement show that the Productivity and Business Processes segment brought in $19.2 billion, a 13% increase, while the Intelligent Cloud segment saw a 20% increase to $25.9 billion. The More Personal Computing segment, bolstered by the Activision acquisition, reported $16.9 billion, up 19%. The balance sheet and cash flow statements, while not detailed in this summary, further solidify the company's strong financial position.\nMicrosoft's robust financial performance is a clear indicator of its strong market position and the successful execution of its strategic initiatives, particularly in cloud services and gaming. The acquisition of Activision has significantly boosted its gaming segment, and continued growth in cloud services suggests a positive outlook for future revenue streams. However, the company must navigate the challenges of integrating AI technology and maintaining its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving industry.\nFor a more detailed analysis and to stay updated on Microsoft Corp's future performance, visit GuruFocus.com for comprehensive reports and investment insights.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Microsoft Corp for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is doubling down on its commitment to AI with the introduction of a new keyboard key dedicated specifically to the company\u2019s Windows Copilot. The first update to the Windows PC keyboard in almost 30 years, the Copilot key will be available on laptops and desktop keyboards from Microsoft\u2019s OEM partners beginning in February.\nAccording to Microsoft corporate vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi, pressing the key will bring up Copilot, allowing you to search for content on the web, as well as for your own content and for general PC features via the app\u2019s generative AI functionality. The idea is for Copilot to function as a kind of smart assistant that you can pull up at any time.\nWhile Microsoft didn\u2019t announce any specific partners that will launch with the Copilot key, it said that companies should begin unveiling desktops and laptops equipped with the feature in the coming days. We\u2019ll also get an up-close look at the capability at CES 2024, which kicks off Jan. 9.\nBy getting its hardware partners to add a Copilot key to their laptops and desktops, Microsoft is showing that it believes generative AI is inextricable from the future of personal computing. The last time Microsoft added a new keyboard key was when it debuted the Windows key in 1994.\nMicrosoft spent much of 2023 making a series of AI announcements ranging from the debut of its Bing chatbot and Edge browser to its Copilot for Microsoft 365. CEO Satya Nadella has said that advancements in AI will impact nearly every part of the company\u2019s business.\nSemiconductor giants are also getting in on the AI movement. AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each debuted their own AI PC chips with dedicated neural processors designed to handle AI-specific tasks such as running generative AI applications.\nHow much consumers will benefit from those chips, though, is still up in the air. Even Intel doesn\u2019t know exactly what kinds of apps developers will eventually cook up that rely on or take advantage of neural processors.\nThe AI PC movement comes at a time when the PC market is expected to return to growth for the first time since 2021, according to Goldman Sachs Equity Research analyst Michael Ng.\n\u201cIn our view, global PC shipments in 2024 will be driven by the beginning of a refresh cycle as pandemic-purchased devices start to reach four years of age & new AI-capable PCs come to market (later in 2024) in what we view as the first technological shift in personal computing since the widespread adoption of smartphones/tablets,\u201d Ng wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nThe expected resurgence in PC sales follows years of declines after an explosion of growth at the onset of the pandemic. At that time, consumers and businesses, eager to get their hands on PCs to work and play, purchased new laptops and desktops in droves.\nAs those systems age, however, consumers will begin buying up newer PCs, which will help drive AI PC adoption. And that will inevitably help Microsoft, as well as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm\u2019s bottom lines.\nRead more coverage from CES 2024:\nNvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power gaming and AI efforts at CES 2024\nAMD debuts AI-focused Ryzen 8000G desktop chips at CES 2024\nMicrosoft is adding an AI button to PC keyboards, their first major change in 30 years\nFrom AI to flying cars, here\u2019s what to expect at CES 2024\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) business has exploded over the last decade, with its stock up about 920% since 2014. The company has become a tech behemoth, with growing positions in multiple areas of the industry. Significant cash reserves have helped Microsoft successfully venture into cloud computing, video games, artificial intelligence (AI), consumer products, and more.\nThe company is active in a diverse range of high-growth markets, making it one of the most attractive investment options right now. In fact, recent boosts to its stock price suggest Microsoft could be on a path to overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company by market cap.\nSo, here's why Microsoft's stock is a no-brainer buy right now.\nThe gap between Microsoft and Apple's market cap is narrowing, currently separated by about $100 billion. Microsoft is coming out of a stellar growth year, which saw its stock rise 57% throughout 2023, outperforming Apple's 48%. Meanwhile, the Windows company arguably has more growth opportunities in the coming years.\nApple has carved out a powerful position in tech with the immense popularity of products like the iPhone, MacBook, and a range of digital services. However, its reliance on consumers makes it vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds, with revenue dipping 3% year over year in fiscal 2023.\nConversely, Microsoft's priority on commercial sectors like cloud computing and digital productivity services has fortified its business against the worst market declines. In its fiscal 2023, revenue rose 6% year over year to $212 billion, despite the economically challenging period. Growth was mainly driven by a 19% rise in revenue from its cloud platform, Azure, and a 9% increase from its productivity segment.\nMoreover, Microsoft emerged as one of the biggest players in AI last year. Heavy investment in the industry saw it achieve a 49% stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, granting it access to some of the most advanced AI models.\nThe company has used OpenAI's tech to bring AI upgrades to many of its services, including Office, Azure, and search engine Bing. These platforms attract billions of users and could help Microsoft become the go-to for anyone looking to integrate AI into their workflow.\nApple is also investing in AI, but it remains unclear how it plans to use the technology to boost earnings over the long term, suggesting Microsoft has a firmer role in the high-growth sector for now.\nThis chart compares the forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of some of the most prominent names in tech, with Microsoft's higher figure indicating its stock is one of the more expensive options. However, the company has arguably earned its higher price tag by delivering years of reliable growth, leading positions in multiple tech markets, and significant cash reserves.\nIn fact, Microsoft surpassed $63 billion in free cash flow last year, suggesting it has the funds to fuel its R&D and overcome potential headwinds.\nAdditionally, EPS estimates show the company has much to offer new investors over the next two years.\nThis chart shows Microsoft's earnings could hit $15 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that figure by the company's forward P/E of 33, you're given a stock price of $495. Considering Microsoft's current position, these projections would see its stock rise 35% over the next two fiscal years. Comparatively, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 have risen at annual growth rates of 23% and 17% over the last five years, suggesting Microsoft would outperform both indexes.\nAlongside the fact it's a business on track to become the world's most valuable company, Microsoft's stock is a no-brainer buy this month and one you won't want to miss.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. overtook Apple Inc. to become the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company for the first time in more than two years, as worries over smartphone demand have weighed on the iPhone-maker\u2019s stock in recent weeks.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip\nStocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap\nApple Must Stop Selling Watches With Blood Oxygen Feature\nJPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year\nChina Population Extends Record Drop on Covid Deaths, Low Births\nThe Redmond, Washington-based software giant rose 1% to $388.47 on Friday, ending with a market valuation of $2.89 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple gained 0.2% and closed with a market capitalization of $2.87 trillion. It\u2019s the first time since November 2021 that Microsoft has closed with a higher value than Apple.\n\u201cWhen you compare and contrast the two, the growth Apple is showing is nothing special, whereas Microsoft has done a better job of executing and demonstrating earnings growth,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, which has positions in both. \u201cMicrosoft also has a much clearer roadmap with AI, and it has done a great job articulating how that will accelerate growth to make its long-term prospects even more compelling.\u201d\nWhile both were part of the so-called Magnificent 7\u2019s powerful rally in 2023, their fortunes have diverged this year. Microsoft has risen 3.3%, supported by ongoing optimism over artificial intelligence, while Apple has dropped 3.4% amid rising concerns over its growth. It has been hit by at least three analyst ratings downgrades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nWall Street\u2019s less-favorable view on Apple suggests it would not be surprising if Microsoft maintained or even built on its newfound size advantage. The average analyst price target for Microsoft equates to upside of about 8% over the coming 12 months, slightly above Apple\u2019s return potential. Such a gain would result in Microsoft topping $3 trillion in market valuation, joining Apple as one of only two companies to hit such a threshold.\nMicrosoft and Apple remain the biggest weights in the S&P 500 by far, together accounting for roughly 14% of the overall index. Few other companies approach them in size. Oil giant Saudi Aramco\u2019s value sits at just over $2 trillion, while Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Nvidia Corp. are all valued above $1 trillion. Meta Platforms Inc., which jumped nearly 200% last year, is the next closest, sitting just below the trillion-dollar threshold.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJapan\u2019s Market Roars Back to Life\u2014With Old-Timers Leading the Way\nElon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla\nThere\u2019s a Toxic Employee\u2014and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue\nChinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft's Windows Faces a New Threat From an Old Enemy",
        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Windows is the overwhelmingly dominant operating system running on PCs around the world, and it's been that way for decades. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) ubiquitous OS enjoyed a 72% share of the global desktop operating system market at the end of 2023, with Apple's OS X a distant second at 16%. These figures come from Statcounter and should be interpreted as ballpark estimates, but it's clear that Windows reigns supreme.\nWhile Windows remains dominant, it has lost some of that dominance over time. According to Statcounter, Windows' market share has dropped more than 20 percentage points since 2009. The increasing popularity of Apple's Mac computers explains most of that decline, but not all of it.\nLinux, in all its variants, has become far more prevalent over the past 15 years. Linux had a market share of just 0.68% in 2009. In 2023, that share had ballooned to 3.82%. That's still tiny compared to Windows, but a fivefold increase is notable, nonetheless.\nWhile the odds have always been stacked against Linux in the battle for OS supremacy, a fairly recent development could pave the way for further erosion of Microsoft's market share.\nWhile Linux distributions have become more user-friendly over time, with some even doing a pretty good job of mimicking the Windows experience, they still require a level of technical know-how that is beyond the typical PC user. Linux is extremely popular among software developers, with around 45% of developers reporting Linux as their preferred OS. But most PC users are not writing code or doing anything more technical than the occasional spreadsheet.\nFor users who are tech-savvy enough to use Linux but don't, one reason for sticking with Windows is the state of the PC gaming industry. Because Windows dominates in terms of market share, PC games are often developed for Windows exclusively. Going through the trouble of porting a game to Linux rarely makes commercial sense, given its minuscule market share.\nSteam, the leading PC gaming platform, recently published a list of the top-grossing games of 2023. Except for a handful, nearly all of them are built for Windows only. The latest Call of Duty is Windows-only. Cyberpunk 2077 is Windows-only. Grand Theft Auto 5, one of the best-selling games of all time, is Windows-only. The list goes on.\nWith almost no chance that major game developers will ever bother bringing their games to Linux natively, Valve, the company behind Steam, has taken matters into its own hands. Driven by the need to make its handheld Steam Deck, which is powered by Linux, a success, Valve has been working on a compatibility layer called Proton. Built on top of work done by others over the years, Proton translates the Windows-specific bits and enables games built for Windows to run on Linux-based systems.\nProton is not perfect, and some games still have major issues. But according to ProtonDB, a website that tracks compatibility, more than 4,300 games are verified to work well on the Linux-powered Steam Deck, while over 13,000 are playable. This is a sea change compared to a few years ago.\nWindows is still an important business for Microsoft, with the OS generating $21.5 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023, which ended on June 30. The dominance of Windows also contributes to the dominance of Microsoft's Office suite of productivity software, as well as ancillary products like OneDrive cloud storage.\nWindows will also be critical in Microsoft's efforts to monetize its massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Copilot in Windows is an early attempt at an AI-powered assistant, and while its functionality is limited, it could evolve into a powerful tool for Windows users. On the commercial side, Microsoft already charges $30 per user per month for an AI-powered assistant that integrates with its Office applications. Microsoft is likely aiming to eventually generate recurring revenue from AI-powered features built into Windows.\nWindows will remain the dominant OS for the foreseeable future, but the progress made in bringing PC games to Linux-based systems will likely peel away some tech-savvy users. Windows accounted for just 10% of Microsoft's revenue in fiscal 2023, but its dominance drives revenue in other parts of the company. Windows is going to be at the center of Microsoft's push to turn AI into a real business, and any market share losses will act as a headwind.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "After years of trailing Apple in the race to be the world's largest company (by market cap), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has edged ahead of its longtime rival.\nAAPL Market Cap data by YCharts\nAnd if its recent earnings report is any indication, Microsoft may not give up that lead anytime soon. Here's why.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft reported second-quarter financial results for the three months ending Dec. 31. Highlights included:\nTotal revenue of $62 billion, topping Wall Street's consensus expectations and up 18% year over year.\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.93/share, also topping forecasts.\nMicrosoft's signature cloud business, Azure, grew revenue 30% year over year.\nNet income rose to $21.9 billion, up 33% from a year earlier.\nXbox content and services revenue soared by 61% year over year (driven by the completion of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard).\nIn short, it was another fantastic quarter for Microsoft, which executed well on numerous fronts. \nLet's start with artificial intelligence (AI), the hottest subject on Wall Street.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella got right to the point in his earnings commentary, noting, \"We've moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale...By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we're winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\"\nIn a nutshell, Microsoft is doing precisely what investors want: converting AI innovations into revenue. In other words, the company is monetizing AI.\nWhat's more, key segments are still delivering massive growth despite their enormous size. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment reported $25.9 billion in revenue, up 20% year over year. Microsoft's More Personal Computing segment (which includes its Xbox unit) reported revenue of $16.9 billion, up 19% year over year, thanks, in part, to its acquisition of Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard.\nMicrosoft's execution means that shareholders are in for some rewards. The company has already returned $8.4 billion to shareholders in its most recent quarter alone -- $5.6 billion in the form of dividends, and $2.8 billion through its share repurchase program.\nHowever, with $9.1 billion in free cash flow in just the fourth quarter and more than $140 billion in cash on hand, the company can increase shareholder returns if management so chooses.\nGranted, Microsoft shares aren't cheap. They now trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of almost 40x, making them almost twice as expensive as the average S&P 500 stock. Therefore, Microsoft may not be a great fit for every investor, or for every portfolio. \nNevertheless, thanks to its enormous size, incredible range of businesses, fantastic management, and the massive AI tailwind at its back, Microsoft still looks like an unstoppable juggernaut. \nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "If you're a beginner investor, the idea of creating a portfolio from the ground up can feel like an impossible goal to achieve. That's why you should start by looking at stocks that are set to beat the market over the next 12 months, a strategy that's been proven to generate strong returns.\nNow, let's break down why adding this one exceptional stock, highlighted below, to your portfolio could be a recipe for success.\nWhy You Should Pay Attention to Microsoft (MSFT)\nMicrosoft Corporation is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. The company dominates the PC software market with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems.\nOn February 1, 2016, MSFT was added to the Zacks Focus List at $55.09 per share. Shares have increased 614.96% to $393.87 since then.\nOne analyst revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $11.14. MSFT boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.8%.\nAdditionally, Microsoft's earnings are expected to grow 13.6% for the current fiscal year.\nSince stock prices respond to earnings estimate revisions, it can be very profitable to buy stocks with an increased earnings outlook. By buying a Focus List stock like MSFT, then, you're likely getting into a company whose future earnings estimates will be raised, potentially leading to price momentum.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 6.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $398.67 in the previous session. Microsoft has gained 6% since the start of the year compared to the 59.9% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 64.5% return for the Zacks Computer - Software industry.\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 24, 2023, Microsoft reported EPS of $2.99 versus consensus estimate of $2.65 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.9%.\nFor the current fiscal year, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $11.14 per share on $242.41 billion in revenues. This represents a 13.56% change in EPS on a 14.39% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $12.70 per share on $275.28 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.02% and 13.56%, respectively.\nValuation Metrics\nMicrosoft may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nMicrosoft has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 35.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 33.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 34X versus its peer group's average of 27.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.31. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Microsoft fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Microsoft shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Dan Howley, has been tracking this for us. Dan, where do things stand?\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, Seana. There's a few industries that are seemingly getting a good amount of AI play. And I just want to go over them real quickly. And then we'll get into the businesses that are really making some moolah on this.\nSo just some of the industries that you can think of are automotive. They've been doing this for-- for a little bit now. If you think of self-driving cars, it's AI, right? We-- we talk about generative AI, the big explosion from ChatGPT. But AI has been around for quite a while. It's been on my phone. It's-- it's going in a lot of smart TVs.\nAnd it's part of the automobile now, whether it's keeping you in your lane with lane assist or warning you about people in front of you with that kind of automatic cruise control. Another one is actually agriculture, which is really interesting.\nAt CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, there were tractors that can look at a field and then notice where a weed is and then spray only on that weed. It makes sure that herbicides aren't being sprayed over everything. And it helps save them some money.\nAnd then, obviously, health care, that's something where generative AI is looking to break in, where it will allow doctors to quickly summarize what they see from patients, giving them a quick rundown. Those are some of the industries. Let's look at some of the companies, though, that are starting to make some of that cash.\nWe'll start off with the big one. Obviously, we have Microsoft and Google. They are making money through OpenA-- excuse me, through OpenAI-Microsoft, that team-up. And then with Google, they're Gemini.\nRight now what Microsoft is doing is they're offering their Copilot 365 for $30 per seat per month. That's per person. Those are for every business. Now, they recently opened that up for every business that wants access to it. Previously, it was just larger businesses with 300 employees and more. Now they're selling it for $20 a month for regular folks.\nWe also have Tesla in there. They're using AI. Meta is using AI. They've been using it for a while. But they're really leaning into it. You saw that they're spending billions of dollars on NVIDIA chips. Speaking of NVIDIA, they're also making money hand over fist. We'll see how they do in their upcoming earnings. But they are just crushing it as far as bringing in the cash.\nAnd then AMD, one of their others, doing a big amount of money as well. Amazon, also one of the companies that's making cash. They've been offering different instances for Gad.Ai and AI that companies can then latch into and build their own AI capabilities through. So they're doing that.\nOn the chip side, we obviously have NVIDIA, Intel, TSMC absolutely dominating because they make the chips. They're the ones that make it for the likes of Qualcomm for Meta, for Microsoft, for Google. They're the ones that are doing all of this. So they're the powerhouse behind that. Intel trying to make its way in. But, look, they're not on the AI side as much as something like an NVIDIA or an AMD.\nHowever, when you look at AMD or NVIDIA, what they sell-- well, NVIDIA, they sell graphics cards. They're trying to get CPUs. Intel makes the CPUs that work with those. So any time you see a new graphics chip going into-- from NVIDIA into a business's servers, Intel is connected to that to some degree most of the time. So don't sleep on them when it comes to this huge amount of money that's coming from AI.\n"

        "Text": "As part of Yahoo Finance's AI Revolution special coverage this week, Tech Editor Dan Howley explores the industries and companies positioned to capitalize on the generative AI boom ahead.\nWhile hype builds around futuristic AI applications, Howley spotlights areas where monetization potential already exists: Automotive, Healthcare, and Agriculture.\nHowley cites leaders like Microsoft (MSFT), whose Copilot program drives enterprise AI adoption, and Nvidia (NVDA), which powers advanced AI computing through its dominance of AI chip manufacturing.\nTo continue watching more of Yahoo Finance's AI Revolution special click here, or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nBRAD SMITH: Tech stocks are back on top, driving the current market rally amid renewed momentum in the AI hype.\nSEANA SMITH: And while the rising tide seems to be lifting all tech boats, at least for now, when it comes down to the bottom line, which industries really stand to make a buck here from AI? Dan Howley, has been tracking this for us. Dan, where do things stand?\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, Seana. There's a few industries that are seemingly getting a good amount of AI play. And I just want to go over them real quickly. And then we'll get into the businesses that are really making some moolah on this.\nSo just some of the industries that you can think of are automotive. They've been doing this for-- for a little bit now. If you think of self-driving cars, it's AI, right? We-- we talk about generative AI, the big explosion from ChatGPT. But AI has been around for quite a while. It's been on my phone. It's-- it's going in a lot of smart TVs.\nAnd it's part of the automobile now, whether it's keeping you in your lane with lane assist or warning you about people in front of you with that kind of automatic cruise control. Another one is actually agriculture, which is really interesting.\nAt CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, there were tractors that can look at a field and then notice where a weed is and then spray only on that weed. It makes sure that herbicides aren't being sprayed over everything. And it helps save them some money.\nAnd then, obviously, health care, that's something where generative AI is looking to break in, where it will allow doctors to quickly summarize what they see from patients, giving them a quick rundown. Those are some of the industries. Let's look at some of the companies, though, that are starting to make some of that cash.\nWe'll start off with the big one. Obviously, we have Microsoft and Google. They are making money through OpenA-- excuse me, through OpenAI-Microsoft, that team-up. And then with Google, they're Gemini.\nRight now what Microsoft is doing is they're offering their Copilot 365 for $30 per seat per month. That's per person. Those are for every business. Now, they recently opened that up for every business that wants access to it. Previously, it was just larger businesses with 300 employees and more. Now they're selling it for $20 a month for regular folks.\nWe also have Tesla in there. They're using AI. Meta is using AI. They've been using it for a while. But they're really leaning into it. You saw that they're spending billions of dollars on NVIDIA chips. Speaking of NVIDIA, they're also making money hand over fist. We'll see how they do in their upcoming earnings. But they are just crushing it as far as bringing in the cash.\nAnd then AMD, one of their others, doing a big amount of money as well. Amazon, also one of the companies that's making cash. They've been offering different instances for Gad.Ai and AI that companies can then latch into and build their own AI capabilities through. So they're doing that.\nOn the chip side, we obviously have NVIDIA, Intel, TSMC absolutely dominating because they make the chips. They're the ones that make it for the likes of Qualcomm for Meta, for Microsoft, for Google. They're the ones that are doing all of this. So they're the powerhouse behind that. Intel trying to make its way in. But, look, they're not on the AI side as much as something like an NVIDIA or an AMD.\nHowever, when you look at AMD or NVIDIA, what they sell-- well, NVIDIA, they sell graphics cards. They're trying to get CPUs. Intel makes the CPUs that work with those. So any time you see a new graphics chip going into-- from NVIDIA into a business's servers, Intel is connected to that to some degree most of the time. So don't sleep on them when it comes to this huge amount of money that's coming from AI.\n"

        "Text": "After years of trailing Apple in the race to be the world's largest company (by market cap), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has edged ahead of its longtime rival.\nAAPL Market Cap data by YCharts\nAnd if its recent earnings report is any indication, Microsoft may not give up that lead anytime soon. Here's why.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft reported second-quarter financial results for the three months ending Dec. 31. Highlights included:\nTotal revenue of $62 billion, topping Wall Street's consensus expectations and up 18% year over year.\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.93/share, also topping forecasts.\nMicrosoft's signature cloud business, Azure, grew revenue 30% year over year.\nNet income rose to $21.9 billion, up 33% from a year earlier.\nXbox content and services revenue soared by 61% year over year (driven by the completion of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard).\nIn short, it was another fantastic quarter for Microsoft, which executed well on numerous fronts. \nLet's start with artificial intelligence (AI), the hottest subject on Wall Street.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella got right to the point in his earnings commentary, noting, \"We've moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale...By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we're winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\"\nIn a nutshell, Microsoft is doing precisely what investors want: converting AI innovations into revenue. In other words, the company is monetizing AI.\nWhat's more, key segments are still delivering massive growth despite their enormous size. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment reported $25.9 billion in revenue, up 20% year over year. Microsoft's More Personal Computing segment (which includes its Xbox unit) reported revenue of $16.9 billion, up 19% year over year, thanks, in part, to its acquisition of Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard.\nMicrosoft's execution means that shareholders are in for some rewards. The company has already returned $8.4 billion to shareholders in its most recent quarter alone -- $5.6 billion in the form of dividends, and $2.8 billion through its share repurchase program.\nHowever, with $9.1 billion in free cash flow in just the fourth quarter and more than $140 billion in cash on hand, the company can increase shareholder returns if management so chooses.\nGranted, Microsoft shares aren't cheap. They now trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of almost 40x, making them almost twice as expensive as the average S&P 500 stock. Therefore, Microsoft may not be a great fit for every investor, or for every portfolio. \nNevertheless, thanks to its enormous size, incredible range of businesses, fantastic management, and the massive AI tailwind at its back, Microsoft still looks like an unstoppable juggernaut. \nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 29, 2024\n\u00a0\nJake Lerch has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "Author": " Brian Sozzi    \u00b7 Executive Editor",
        "Text": "When you are a stock priced for greatness but only deliver a super good earnings report, sometimes investors will get in a huff.\nSuch is the case with the initial crop of earnings from tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). The three stocks (with a combined market cap of $5.2 trillion) were instrumental in powering the broader market to records over the past year but are getting dinged after reporting earnings late Tuesday.\nThe moves are \"signaling some overextension of the recent strong rally,\" said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance.\nAt first glance, the negative moves in the stock prices would seem counterintuitive to the average investor who has ridden these tech giants to massive paper gains.\nBut here is the deal, as President Biden would put it.\nThat average investor probably read the earnings releases of these bellwether companies last night. I\u2019ll say a good percentage of them listened to the earnings calls (which you should be doing!).\nBy 7:00 p.m. last night, with a full page of notes, many investors still can\u2019t figure out why these stocks are being swept into downdrafts.\nAll three companies showed impressive growth numbers (especially AMD, with data center sales up 38% year over year and a 75% hike to 2024 AI chip sales estimates), hyped the AI train again (a surefire ticket for stock gains last year), and didn\u2019t sound serious alarm bells on the economy.\nSo what gives?\nThe reality is that none of these quarters were perfect versus investor expectations of perfection. And believe me, investors have priced in perfection to these stocks: according to Yahoo Finance data, these three stocks trade on an average forward P/E multiple of 35 times. The S&P 500 trades at 22 times, for perspective.\nThe vibe coming off these earnings, according to sources, is that growth is good because of the expansion of new AI tools and other businesses but not mind-blowingly good.\nMicrosoft\u2019s results unearthed some caution on the economy, pros say.\n\"While Microsoft\u2019s F2Q24 top-line results for the two most important businesses (Azure and Office 365 Commercial) were in line to a little better than consensus expectations (and guidance), they were a bit below what our plausible scenario anticipated, indicating slightly moderating business momentum,\" Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci wrote in a note to clients.\nGoogle missed estimates for its ad revenue (from Search and YouTube), and its cloud business didn't light it up versus its larger rival in Microsoft's Azure.\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill noted on Alphabet: \"Strong ad demand drove accelerating, double-digit growth in Search and YouTube, though shy of some investor bogeys. Cloud growth re-accelerated, but remains below Azure.\"\nAs for AMD, its gaming chip sales fell 17% from the year prior, and guidance didn't wow the investing masses.\n\"This knee-jerk reaction [to tech results] is noise, the AI revolution has started,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me via email.\nPerhaps.\nBut all in, Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" will have to do better than Microsoft, AMD, and Alphabet to impress investors demanding excellence paired with a side of perfection.\nIf they don't, 2024 may go down as the year of the Unmagnificent Seven.\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

That included more than 10,000 cuts at Microsoft.\nAnalysts and industry experts have said they expect fewer layoffs this year, with firms that are racing to catch up in the AI space more likely to downsize to offset the billions of dollars they are spending on the technology.\nThe Verge was the first to report the news on the latest job cuts by Microsoft.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam; Editing by Devika Syamnath, Arun Koyyur and Krishna Chandra Eluri)\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday announced that it is launching a paid version of its generative AI-powered Copilot platform for consumers. The option, called Copilot Pro, will cost $20 per month per user, and give users access to a number of additional capabilities, including access to the latest AI models and improved AI image generation via Image Creator from Designer.\nThe move comes as Microsoft looks to monetize its massive investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and continue to build on the momentum behind generative AI that kicked off in 2023.\nMicrosoft says Copilot Pro was developed for individual users who want to get priority access models, including GPT-4 Turbo, OpenAI\u2019s latest offering, during peak usage hours for improved overall performance, as well as the ability to access Copilot across Microsoft\u2019s Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote apps.\nThe company says that Copilot Pro will provide a single experience on the PC, web, and apps, as well as iOS and Android. Microsoft says Copilot Pro will also include access to its Image Creator and the option to customize your own Copilot GPTs for certain topics, whether that\u2019s for working out, cooking, or any other interest you might have.\nIn addition to Copilot Pro, Microsoft has also announced that it\u2019s dropping the minimum user limit for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Microsoft previously limited the offering to companies purchasing licenses for 300 seats or more. The change opens up the software to small and medium businesses.\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 brings Copilot to the company\u2019s suite of productivity apps, including Word, Excel, OneNote, Teams, and more. The enterprise edition of the software also allows companies to expand Copilot to their internal data, giving them the ability to search for and summarize their own content, not just data from the web. Access to the service is priced at $30 per user per month.\nMicrosoft is investing $10 billion over 10 years in OpenAI as a means of expanding its position in the enterprise productivity market and with the hope that it can simultaneously steal market share away from rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) in the search market via its AI-powered Bing chat and Edge browser.\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine the average consumer subscribing to Copilot Pro, especially for $20 per month, but users who want to dive deeper into using generative AI or need quick access to high-powered AI models could find the service extremely useful.\nMore importantly, for Microsoft, the addition of Copilot Pro and opening up Copilot for Microsoft 365 to a larger number of business users will bring in more revenue for its AI efforts, providing Wall Street with further proof that the company is monetizing its investments.\nMicrosoft is moving quickly to push AI as one of its main product offerings. In addition to its Copilot platforms, the company recently debuted a Copilot key for Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The first new key for the Windows keyboard since the introduction of the Windows key itself, the Copilot key, provides instant access to the Copilot app on users\u2019 PCs.\nElevating Copilot to such a position shows how much Microsoft is set on showing that AI is an enormously important part of its future on a par with cloud computing. But Microsoft isn\u2019t the only company working to seize the AI moment. Google is also selling access to its enterprise-grade productivity suite with its Duet AI platform, while Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM), and others look to gain more traction as well.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this software maker a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Microsoft is 21.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 13.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 13.3%.\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Microsoft has an S/TA ratio of 0.54, which means that the company gets $0.54 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.47, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Microsoft is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 14.4% this year versus the industry average of 9.1%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Microsoft. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Microsoft a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Microsoft is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Investors in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have seen strong returns of 288% over the past five years",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up an impressive 268% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 20% in about a quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 12% in 90 days).\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Microsoft achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 33% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 30% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nWe know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Microsoft will grow revenue in the future.\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Microsoft's TSR for the last 5 years was 288%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nIt's nice to see that Microsoft shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 31%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Microsoft .\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

This is especially true as Apple\u2019s market value has decreased to $2.87 trillion while Microsoft is trading at nearly $2.84 trillion.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The competition is not new as Microsoft has occasionally surpassed Apple in market value since 2018, most recently in 2021.The tug-of-war between the two tech giants has put focus on tech ETFs having the largest exposure to these companies. These are Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW and MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC.These ETFs have Apple and Microsoft as the top two holdings. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AppleAfter rising 48% in the previous year, the iPhone maker has been struggling in 2024, with shares plunging 4% on concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Two analysts \u2014 Piper Sandler and Barclays \u2014 downgraded the stock rating on worries about iPhone demand. iPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024 due to growing competitive pressure from Huawei and other domestic rivals.Adding to Apple's challenges is the tepid forecast for its new product, the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which is set to be launched in the United States on Feb 2. Analysts predict that its impact on Apple's earnings per share will be minimal.Further, the tech giant had offered a cautious outlook for the holiday quarter.

        "Text": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) announced on Wednesday that it is teaming up with some of the biggest names in tech to launch the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot program.\nThe NAIRR pilot, the NSF said, is designed to create a national resource for researchers and educators to access high-powered AI technologies with the goal of ensuring the US continues to lead in AI research and innovation.\nCompanies and nonprofits joining in the two-year pilot program consist of a murderers' row of some of the biggest names in AI, including Amazon (AMZN), Anthropic, Hugging Face, IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), OpenAI, and Palantir (PLTR), among others.\nFederal agencies participating in the effort include the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Agriculture.\nNAIRR, which was born out of President Biden\u2019s AI executive order, will serve as a framework for how the government and private sector can advance AI technologies in the future.\n\u201cBy investing in AI research through the NAIRR pilot, the United States unleashes discovery and impact and bolsters its global competitiveness,\u201d NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement.\n\u201cTo continue leading in AI research and development, we must create opportunities across the country to advance AI innovation and strengthen educational opportunities, empowering the nation to shape international standards and igniting economic growth,\u201d he added.\nAccording to the NSF, NAIRR will function as a shared national infrastructure that will provide communities across the country with the hardware, models, and resources needed to advance the AI ecosystem.\nThe program, the NSF said, is necessary because AI resources have become concentrated and difficult to access for many communities, whether those are smaller colleges or institutions in rural areas and territories.\nExamples of potential use cases include allowing an AI researcher to investigate the validation and verification of large models or a lecturer from a community college or minority institution to provide students access to AI systems.\nTech companies, the foundation explained, aren\u2019t being paid to provide access to their services, but rather are making in-kind contributions to those made by government agencies.\nContributions include support for 20 research projects by Amazon, access to Anthropic\u2019s Claude model for 10 researchers working on climate change projects, 100 compute grants from Hugging Face, datasets and benchmarks from IBM, $20 million in compute credits for Microsoft\u2019s Azure, and $30 million in support from Nvidia, including $24 million worth of computing for the company\u2019s DGX platform.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday announced that it is launching a paid version of its generative AI-powered Copilot platform for consumers. The option, called Copilot Pro, will cost $20 per month per user, and give users access to a number of additional capabilities, including access to the latest AI models and improved AI image generation via Image Creator from Designer.\nThe move comes as Microsoft looks to monetize its massive investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and continue to build on the momentum behind generative AI that kicked off in 2023.\nMicrosoft says Copilot Pro was developed for individual users who want to get priority access models, including GPT-4 Turbo, OpenAI\u2019s latest offering, during peak usage hours for improved overall performance, as well as the ability to access Copilot across Microsoft\u2019s Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote apps.\nThe company says that Copilot Pro will provide a single experience on the PC, web, and apps, as well as iOS and Android. Microsoft says Copilot Pro will also include access to its Image Creator and the option to customize your own Copilot GPTs for certain topics, whether that\u2019s for working out, cooking, or any other interest you might have.\nIn addition to Copilot Pro, Microsoft has also announced that it\u2019s dropping the minimum user limit for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Microsoft previously limited the offering to companies purchasing licenses for 300 seats or more. The change opens up the software to small and medium businesses.\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 brings Copilot to the company\u2019s suite of productivity apps, including Word, Excel, OneNote, Teams, and more. The enterprise edition of the software also allows companies to expand Copilot to their internal data, giving them the ability to search for and summarize their own content, not just data from the web. Access to the service is priced at $30 per user per month.\nMicrosoft is investing $10 billion over 10 years in OpenAI as a means of expanding its position in the enterprise productivity market and with the hope that it can simultaneously steal market share away from rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) in the search market via its AI-powered Bing chat and Edge browser.\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine the average consumer subscribing to Copilot Pro, especially for $20 per month, but users who want to dive deeper into using generative AI or need quick access to high-powered AI models could find the service extremely useful.\nMore importantly, for Microsoft, the addition of Copilot Pro and opening up Copilot for Microsoft 365 to a larger number of business users will bring in more revenue for its AI efforts, providing Wall Street with further proof that the company is monetizing its investments.\nMicrosoft is moving quickly to push AI as one of its main product offerings. In addition to its Copilot platforms, the company recently debuted a Copilot key for Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The first new key for the Windows keyboard since the introduction of the Windows key itself, the Copilot key, provides instant access to the Copilot app on users\u2019 PCs.\nElevating Copilot to such a position shows how much Microsoft is set on showing that AI is an enormously important part of its future on a par with cloud computing. But Microsoft isn\u2019t the only company working to seize the AI moment. Google is also selling access to its enterprise-grade productivity suite with its Duet AI platform, while Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM), and others look to gain more traction as well.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 triggered a boom in artificial intelligence (AI), with countless tech firms pivoting their businesses toward the budding industry.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That trajectory would see the sector exceed a value of $1 trillion before the end of the decade, suggesting there's no better time than the present to invest in AI-minded companies.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options, with both companies investing heavily in the market and active in one of the biggest growth areas of AI: cloud computing. These companies have emerged as some of the biggest threats in the industry and could deliver significant gains over the long term.\nSo, let's take a closer look at these companies and determine whether Microsoft or Amazon is the better AI stock right now.\nMicrosoft was an early investor in AI, sinking $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019. The company has since increased its investment, achieving a 49% stake in the start-up. The partnership with OpenAI has granted Microsoft exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI models, which it has used to bring upgrades across its product lineup.\nOver the last year, elements of ChatGPT have been integrated into Microsoft's search engine Bing, a range of new AI tools have been added to its cloud platform Azure, and its various Office services now offer improved productivity with the help of AI.\nMicrosoft is a behemoth in the tech world, with millions of consumers and businesses relying on its software. The popularity of its services and OpenAI's tech could be a powerful combination over the long term.\nIn the first quarter of 2024 (ending September 2023), Microsoft posted 13% in year-over-year revenue growth, beating Wall Street estimates by nearly $2 billion. Significant gains came from the company's cloud and productivity segments, which saw revenue rise 19% and 13%, respectively. These divisions are hyperfocused on AI development, which appears to be paying off.\nAlongside free cash flow that hit $63 billion last year, Microsoft is on a promising growth path. The company has the brand power and financial resources to become one of the biggest threats in AI.\nAmazon pulled off an impressive turnaround in 2023 after its stock plunged roughly 50% the year before. Since last January, its shares have soared over 62% thanks to a return to profitability in its e-commerce business and significant potential in AI.\nOver the last year, various cost-cutting measures have seen Amazon's free cash flow skyrocket 427% to $16 billion. The company has restructured its business to prioritize profit growth and is, therefore, investing heavily in its most profitable division: Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nThe cloud platform is responsible for over 62% of Amazon's operating income despite earning the lowest revenue out of its three segments. In Q3 2023, AWS achieved nearly $7 billion in profits, representing growth of 29% year over year.\nThe cloud market is expanding quickly, boosted by the emergence of AI. Businesses are increasingly looking for ways to boost efficiency with the help of AI and turning to cloud services to do so. Meanwhile, AWS' leading 32% market share in cloud computing positions it well to see big gains as AI develops.\nAmazon's dominant position in cloud computing makes the company one of the best ways to invest in AI.\nMicrosoft and Amazon have emerged as two of the biggest names in AI over the last year. These companies have similar potential in the industry thanks to booming cloud businesses and lucrative opportunities in other areas of tech.\nAs a result, the best way to determine the better AI stock is to consider which is trading at a better value.\nThis chart compares Amazon and Microsoft's price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios. These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a company's financial health against its stock price.\nP/S is calculated by dividing a firm's market cap by its revenue. Meanwhile, PEG divides a stock's price-to-earnings ratio by the growth rate of its earnings. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nIn this case, Amazon's stock is a bargain compared to Microsoft. So, if you're between these two AI stocks, Amazon is the better buy this month and a screaming buy at the start of 2024.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 8, 2024\n\u00a0\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

That included more than 10,000 cuts at Microsoft.\nAnalysts and industry experts have said they expect fewer layoffs this year, with firms that are racing to catch up in the AI space more likely to downsize to offset the billions of dollars they are spending on the technology.\nThe Verge was the first to report the news on the latest job cuts by Microsoft.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam; Editing by Devika Syamnath, Arun Koyyur and Krishna Chandra Eluri)\n"

        "Title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Microsoft Next?",
        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech-titan Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has executed nine stock splits over its long history. Let's say you bought one share between the initial public offering (IPO) in 1986 and the first split in 1987. It would have multiplied into 288 stubs after all the splits. A $1,000 Microsoft investment on the day of that first stock split would be worth $1.05 million today:\nIt's been a while since Microsoft took that route. As you can see in the chart above, the company hasn't split its stock since February 2003, when the share count doubled for the last time.\nOr maybe I should say, \"For the last time so far.\" Given Microsoft's tremendous gains over the last 21 years, I wouldn't be surprised to see a fresh stock split someday soon.\nMind you, I'm not holding my breath for this potential -- but by no means guaranteed -- event. Stock splits don't add value or open up buying windows -- they only make it easier to afford a single share. At the same time, a stock split often signals that the company's board of directors and management team have high confidence that the stock will continue to rise, and that vote of confidence should be seen as good news.\nBelow, I'll take a look at why Microsoft might want to take its stock down from its lofty perch, currently trading at $389 per share with a $2.9 trillion market cap.\nThe stock has done astonishingly well since OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT system to an unsuspecting world. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a leading value driver across the tech sector, and Microsoft sits at the epicenter of this game-changing revolution.\nThe company has committed a $13 billion investment to OpenAI and the AI engine that drives ChatGPT runs on Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing platform. Generative AI features are popping up all over the software mammoth's product portfolio.\nMicrosoft is at the forefront of the AI revolution, with AI infusing everything from its Azure platform to enterprise software. This strategy is showing tangible results -- a rapidly growing customer base for Azure AI services and potential revenue boosts from the AI-enhanced version of Microsoft 365. It's not just a technological leap but a fundamental strategy shift with serious financial connotations.\nIt's not the only ingredient in Microsoft's financial cocktail, of course. The company should also benefit from the improving health of the global economy as inflation pressures fade away. In addition, the recently closed buyout of video game giant Activision Blizzard should drive important changes across the company's entire business.\nBut nothing compares to the promise and potential of its AI expertise. In the words of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, \"The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the internet, and the mobile phone.\" Securing a leading role in that revolution should drive Microsoft's long-term growth to new heights.\nThese are the reasons why Microsoft might announce a stock split in 2024 as the company stands at the threshold of a whole new business era. Projecting strength with a stock split seems like a reasonable move -- and those shares sure look pricey today. Why not cut the largest market cap of all into a larger number of slices?\nIt's no big deal if Microsoft doesn't split its stock this year -- or ever again, for that matter. Most stock brokerages support buying and selling fractional shares nowadays, and stock trades generally don't carry transaction fees anymore.\nIf you only have $50 to invest in Microsoft this month, it's very easy to place an order for one-tenth of a full share. The end result would be exactly the same as waiting for a 10-for-1 stock split and then buying a single stub.\nNobody knows whether Microsoft will go for a stock split at this point, and stock prices may change by a lot before then. You can make a fractional-share trade today at firmly established share prices.\nMicrosoft could very well announce a stock split someday soon. Feel free to buy, sell, or hold the stock according to your own analysis until that long-awaited split comes along -- and don't let it change your investment thesis too much. A confident leadership team can be good news, but that's the only investable quality I see in stock splits.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 16, 2024\n\u00a0\nAnders Bylund has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Microsoft. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\nStock-Split Watch: Is Microsoft Next? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n"

        "Title": "Investors in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have seen strong returns of 288% over the past five years",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up an impressive 268% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 20% in about a quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 12% in 90 days).\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Microsoft achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 33% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 30% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nWe know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Microsoft will grow revenue in the future.\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Microsoft's TSR for the last 5 years was 288%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nIt's nice to see that Microsoft shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 31%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Microsoft .\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

You could argue there's some profit taking in there given the incredible runup that we have seen in both of these stocks.\nMaybe it's a bit of a \"sell the news\" situation. But we've been looking through some analyst notes this morning that seem to suggest sort of where the sentiment is despite these beats that we saw from the company. Specifically on Alphabet, this headline, I think, says it all from Brent Thill over at Jefferies, saying the strong finish is there. But investors wanted more.\nAnd there's a lot of focus here on ad revenue. Yes, we saw an acceleration there-- not exactly where investors wanted it to be, though. It was up about 13% year-on-year. YouTube ads up 11% year-on-year, Rachelle.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. And other commentaries-- we keep seeing that word \"expectations,\" which makes you wonder how much of this, as we were talking about before, already built in to the share price? And we knew that at some point, the rubber was going to meet the road. They were going to want to see those expectations make sense.\nLooking at Stifel analyst Mark Kelly, he said these were healthy advertising results, but not enough, with the stock reaching all time highs into the print-- expectations swiftly ticked higher.

And also, commentary from Evercore ISI in regards to Google, saying this is fundamentally a stronger quarter as gross revenue search YouTube, and cloud, and Google, other revenues all accelerated.\nBut the price actions following the print reflecting that higher expectations that weren't exceeded. And these were really expectations that the Street put on itself here. I mean, some of this was sort of this AI fervor, as you mentioned, some of the profit-taking as well. But at some point, they had to realize that it wasn't just going to keep riding high. People were actually going to want to see some of these results showing up.\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. You could argue there's a bit of a head scratching that's coming through here the day after. A stock like Microsoft, some would say was priced to perfection. You'd have those like Dan Ives who are saying this is a result that the company should frame, because it was so strong.\nBut this headline to me from Guggenheim really says it all-- \"good enough.\" That's the headline coming through from analysts over at Guggenheim, saying topline results on key units all beat Wall Street expectations across the board. Yes, Azure came in better than expected, but they saw growth moderating overall. And here's specifically what they said-- we wonder how far into the future investors will have to look to get past it.\nAre we on the cusp of a return to hyper demand? Or is this simply a new normal? Specifically on Microsoft, Rachelle, you could argue investors are really looking for some additional color on revenue coming through from AI and their product Copilot. Now, having said that, the company didn't report any material gain there on the revenue. It only launched, as in Copilot, only launched one month into the quarter.\nSo that is still to be determined. But you heard Satya Nadella say specifically, we've moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. Based on the share move, you could argue investors wanted to hear more about how they're applying and what that means for the revenue picture.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: That's true. But as we continue to say, and as you mentioned in that context there, still very early days. So a lot of that overexcitement built in, and some of the share price taking a knock because of it.\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The market expects Microsoft (MSFT) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.5%.\nRevenues are expected to be $61.03 billion, up 15.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.04% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Microsoft?\nFor Microsoft, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.93%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Microsoft will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Microsoft would post earnings of $2.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.99, delivering a surprise of +12.83%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nMicrosoft doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\nDifferent than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\nMicrosoft Corporation is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. The company dominates the PC software market with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems.\nMSFT boasts a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.

MSFT also boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.8%.\nLooking at cash flow, Microsoft is expected to report cash flow growth of 3.9% this year; MSFT has generated cash flow growth of 16.6% over the past three to five years.\nMSFT should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive growth fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Growth and VGM Style Scores.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Better AI Stock in 2024: Microsoft vs. Intel",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated Wall Street over the last year -- and for good reason. Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit nearly $200 billion last year and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That forecast would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the end of the decade.\nConsequently, it's not surprising that firms across the tech sector have restructured their businesses to prioritize AI development, creating dozens of ways to invest in the high-growth sector in the new year.\nTwo attractive options are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), with one excelling in the software side of AI and the other making promising inroads in the chip sector. These companies have significant potential in AI and likely have much to offer new investors over the long term.\nSo, let's examine whether Microsoft or Intel is the better AI stock in 2024.\nMicrosoft emerged as one of the biggest threats in AI last year when a heavy investment in the market saw it attain a 49% stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The partnership gave Microsoft access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry, making it highly competitive against rivals Amazon and Alphabet.\nThe Windows company has so far used OpenAI's technology to bring AI upgrades across its product lineup. Aspects of ChatGPT have been integrated into Microsoft's search engine Bing; a range of AI tools are now available on its cloud platform Azure; and the company's various Office platforms are offering boosted productivity with the help of AI.\nIt's still early days for Microsoft's venture into AI, but the company's quarterly earnings suggest its investment is paying off. In the first quarter of 2024 (ending September 2023), Microsoft posted 13% year-over-year revenue growth, beating analysts' estimates by nearly $2 billion.\nSignificant gains came from the company's cloud and productivity segments (both hyper focused on AI development), reporting a revenue rise of 19% and 13%, respectively.\nMoreover, Microsoft hit over $63 billion in free cash flow in 2023, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and flourish in the market over the long term.\nIntel isn't as far along in its AI expansion as Microsoft, but that could mean it has more growth potential in the coming years.\nChip stocks soared last year alongside rising excitement for AI. Nvidia took center stage, getting a headstart in the sector as it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary to train and run AI models. However, Intel is gearing up to challenge Nvidia's dominance in AI, which could see earnings soar in 2024.\nIn December, Intel unveiled a range of new AI GPUs called Gaudi3, designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings. The tech giant also announced new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which both include a neural-processing unit meant to run AI programs faster.\nIntel has had a rough few years, faced with a market downturn that brought steep declines in PC sales. However, its earnings are on the right track. Despite posting a 14% year-over-year dip in revenue in Q3 2023, operating income rose more than 43% to $2 billion.\nIntel is on a promising growth trajectory and could deliver major gains this year thanks to the launch of its new AI chips.\nMicrosoft and Intel have significant potential in AI, with both companies investing heavily in the market. However, Microsoft's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 compared to Intel's 25 makes the Windows company far more expensive. Intel's lower figure indicates its stock offers considerably more value.\nMeanwhile, earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates show Intel may have more stock-growth potential over the next two fiscal years.\nThis chart shows over the next two fiscal years, Microsoft's earnings could hit $15 per share, while Intel's may achieve nearly $3 per share. At first glance, Microsoft looks like a no-brainer. However, multiplying these figures by each company's forward P/E (Microsoft's 36 and Intel's 25) yields stock prices of $540 for Microsoft and $68 for Intel.\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Microsoft's stock rise 36% and Intel's 42% over the next two fiscal years. While both figures are impressive, Intel's higher percentage, cheaper stock price, and prominent role in AI make it a more attractive investment this year.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Jason Schreier ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Video-game maker Blizzard Entertainment canceled one of its biggest projects on Thursday as part of a reorganization under new owner Microsoft Corp. that led to mass layoffs of 1,900 people, or 8% of the gaming division\u2019s total staff. The cancelation of the game, codenamed Odyssey, left Blizzard employees reeling as some lost their jobs and others were left wondering about the future of the studio.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain\nTraders Line Up for \u2018Once-in-a-Generation\u2019 Emerging Markets Bet\nUPS to Cut 12,000 Jobs, Bring Workers in Five Days a Week\nBlackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers\nTrump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts\nMicrosoft announced the news in an email to employees early Thursday morning, and many members of the Odyssey team were subsequently informed that they were being let go. The news arrived three months after Microsoft closed the $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in the largest video-game deal in history.\nAs part of the reorganization, Blizzard also parted ways with President Mike Ybarra and Chief Design Officer Allen Adham, one of the company\u2019s co-founders. Blizzard said its new president will be announced next week.\nThe maker of many hit games, including World of Warcraft and Diablo IV, has mostly focused on its large, existing franchises. But in recent years, the company made a big investment in Odyssey, building up a team of more than 100 people to develop it. The game, set in a new universe, was in development for more than six years and outlasted many other Blizzard incubation projects. Now, the future of such efforts outside of existing franchises is uncertain.\nIn a statement, Blizzard spokesman Andrew Reynolds said the game\u2019s development had ended \u201cas part of a focus on projects that hold the most promise for future growth\u201d and that the company would \u201cmove some of the people on the team to one of several exciting new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development.\u201d\nOdyssey started in 2017 as a pitch from Craig Amai, a Blizzard veteran who worked on World of Warcraft. It was conceived as a survival game, like Minecraft and Rust, but with more polish and fewer bugs. In subsequent years, the team working on the game expanded, and it was announced publicly in 2022 as the company began hiring more staff.Despite the additional resources, the project struggled largely due to technical issues surrounding the engine, or the suite of tools and technology that developers use to construct a game, according to people familiar with the process. Odyssey was originally prototyped on the popular Unreal Engine, from Epic Games Inc., but Blizzard executives decided to switch, in part, because it wouldn\u2019t support their ambitions for vast maps supporting up to 100 players at once.\nBlizzard instead directed the Odyssey team to use Synapse, an internal engine that the company had originally developed for mobile games and envisioned as something that would be shared across many of its projects. But that led to significant problems as the technology was slow to coalesce, and Odyssey\u2019s artists instead spent time prototyping content in the Unreal Engine that they knew would have to be discarded later, said the people.\nWhen the Microsoft acquisition was finalized, some Blizzard staff were hopeful that they might be able to switch back to Unreal Engine rather than trying to finish the game on Synapse. In an interview at BlizzCon in November, Ybarra said that their new parent company would offer them the freedom to use the technology of their choice without having to go through the board of directors as in the past.\n\u201cThe tech leaders will decide what the engines are,\u201d he said.\nDespite the challenges, Odyssey appeared to be making progress. People who played early versions of the game enjoyed it and thought there was a lot of potential in the market for a survival game that hit Blizzard\u2019s bar for quality. Still, Odyssey was years away from completion. At one point, Blizzard was looking to expand the team to hundreds of people in hopes of targeting a 2026 release, but even that seemed overly optimistic to some developers.\nInstead, the project was canceled as the company concluded that Synapse was not ready for production.\n\u201cAs difficult as making these decisions are, experimentation and risk taking are part of Blizzard\u2019s history and the creative process,\u201d spokesman Reynolds said. \u201cIdeas make their way into other games or in some cases become games of their own. Starting something completely new is among the hardest things to do in gaming, and we\u2019re immensely grateful to all of the talented people who supported the project.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThere\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets\nBasketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer\u2019s New $2 Billion Arena\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly\u2019s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nHow to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Most readers would already be aware that Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock increased significantly by 21% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Microsoft's  ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:\n35% = US$77b \u00f7 US$221b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.35 in profit.\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nTo begin with, Microsoft has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 9.8% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 18% net income growth seen by Microsoft over the past five years.\nAs a next step, we compared Microsoft's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 17% in the same period.\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Microsoft's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\nMicrosoft has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 28% (or a retention ratio of 72%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.\nMoreover, Microsoft is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 23%. As a result, Microsoft's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 30% for future ROE.\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Microsoft's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

        "Author": "  Jason Schreier ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Video-game maker Blizzard Entertainment canceled one of its biggest projects on Thursday as part of a reorganization under new owner Microsoft Corp. that led to mass layoffs of 1,900 people, or 8% of the gaming division\u2019s total staff. The cancelation of the game, codenamed Odyssey, left Blizzard employees reeling as some lost their jobs and others were left wondering about the future of the studio.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain\nTraders Line Up for \u2018Once-in-a-Generation\u2019 Emerging Markets Bet\nUPS to Cut 12,000 Jobs, Bring Workers in Five Days a Week\nBlackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers\nTrump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts\nMicrosoft announced the news in an email to employees early Thursday morning, and many members of the Odyssey team were subsequently informed that they were being let go. The news arrived three months after Microsoft closed the $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in the largest video-game deal in history.\nAs part of the reorganization, Blizzard also parted ways with President Mike Ybarra and Chief Design Officer Allen Adham, one of the company\u2019s co-founders. Blizzard said its new president will be announced next week.\nThe maker of many hit games, including World of Warcraft and Diablo IV, has mostly focused on its large, existing franchises. But in recent years, the company made a big investment in Odyssey, building up a team of more than 100 people to develop it.

So Dan, what's the biggest thing that you're watching in Microsoft's report after the closing bell today?\nDAN HOWLEY: For Microsoft, it's going to be the overall cloud segment. So let's just break down some of the earnings for you, guys, real quick. First, the expectation here is for Microsoft to post adjusted earnings of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion. That would be up from $2.32 on $52.7 billion last year.\nThe Intelligent Cloud segment, that's where you get Azure and everything, that's going to be expected to come in at $25.3 billion. And then Microsoft's cloud overall, $32.2 billion. That would be up from $27.1 billion last year. A lot of numbers thrown out there.\nI think the big thing, though, that we're going to be focused on is where Microsoft reports its Copilot earnings, right? That's the AI software that they're pushing with Copilot for Microsoft 365. They also offer different AI capabilities through Azure, where you can build out your own AI Copilot of your own. And oh by the way, the productivity tools that they also have AI built in as well.\nNot to forget though, Microsoft's personal computing business was also hurting as we saw PC sales slip through the last year. We're expecting a rebound. Perhaps that'll happen in this report, maybe the next one. But revenue there is expected to be $16.8 billion, up from $14.2 billion last year.\nSEANA SMITH: And then these are two stocks we're going to take a look at, Microsoft and also Alphabet, their shares trading at all time highs. When it comes to Alphabet, the focus likely going to be on AI, but also the ad part of the business, their ad market and the recovery that we're expected to see there.\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, we're expecting revenue TAC, that's traffic acquisition costs of $7.95 billion. That would be up from $63.1 billion. And yeah, a lot of that is going to be coming from the advertising space. Google makes the vast majority of its money. Google advertising expected to come in at $69.5 billion. That would be $10 billion more-- $10.9 billion more than last year. And Google Services of $75.9 billion, up from $67.8.\nBut Google Cloud revenue-- they broke that out relatively recently. And that's where we're going to potentially see a big jump from $7.2 billion to $8.9 billion. Google Cloud, incredibly important for them to get that up off the ground. Obviously, advertising is still the main revenue generator for Google, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. But they want to build this out on its own to compete with Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's AWS.\nBRAD SMITH: Dan, thanks so much. Of course, two big reports that we're going to be watching for.\nSEANA SMITH: Big day for you.\nDAN HOWLEY: Cannot wait.

And they're going to try to show that there's intelligent enterprise and the intelligent cloud. That's where the revenue is coming from on that end.\nAnd Google, on the other hand, has been coming at it from a very, very carefully curated way, coming at it from search. And they're actually showing a lot of traction in terms of what's happening in cloud. Both these companies are depending on AI and cloud revenue. AI is the pass-through and pull-through for Microsoft. And also, for Google, when we're talking about cloud and AI, and you cannot separate those two. And they're actually having an impact on revenue.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And Daniel, I want to bring you in here because, obviously, Satya Nadella probably feeling pretty good about everything with that $3 trillion market valuation. But what are you going to want to hear, not just in the earnings report, but also on the earnings call about how they're embedding AI into their existing products and services?\nDANIEL FLAX: We'll be looking for signs that they're making continued progress with solutions like Copilot, for example, where it remains early. Really, if we step back and really think about what's going on here, it's about helping users make better informed decisions, work faster, work more efficiently. That drives productivity in organizations, and, ultimately, contributes to Microsoft's growth.\nSo we'll look to see how they're navigating what is, of course, a difficult environment. But the key is investing, innovating, and empowering others to be successful on the Microsoft platform.\nAKIKO FUJITA: Daniel, we have seen Microsoft out ahead on AI. The question is, how much of that value from Copilot has actually been unlocked? We've heard from the company hint that this is just the beginning in terms of user experience. How are you looking at that specifically, Daniel?\nDANIEL FLAX: It's very early. When we talk to users, there's a lot of potential with Copilot. But it's going to take time, a lot of iterating. All organizations are going to have to adjust their processes, work carefully with Microsoft and its partners to really implement this and drive productivity.\nThere are areas like software development, for example, where you can see faster returns. But it's going to be this ability to help or use AI to help drive revenue, become more efficient on the cost side. It's a journey.

Even so, they are likely to be asked about further cost reductions after the significant job cuts they have each embarked on in recent weeks.\nRead more: Stock Market\u2019s Fate Rests on $10 Trillion in Big Tech Earnings\nApple Inc., grappling with slowing China sales, antitrust accusations and bruised from a patent fight, could give investors a better sense of early demand for its new Vision Pro, which some big-name developers are steering clear of. Boeing Co., mired deep in a safety crisis that prompted the US Federal Aviation Administration to freeze a planned production increase of 737 Max, will face more questions about how it plans to allay concerns over the quality of its aircraft.\nMonday: No notable earnings.\nTuesday: Microsoft (MSFT US) is set to post a 16% jump to record quarterly sales, with TD Cowen seeing strength in its Azure segment from returning cloud customers and rising AI demand. The monetization of its AI-powered virtual assistant Copilot will be scrutinized though the product won\u2019t make significant topline contributions until later this year, Evercore said.\nAlphabet\u2019s (GOOGL US) earnings per share is seen rising 53%, with Jefferies pointing to ad revenue growth in the year-end quarter and the ramping up of NFL Sunday Ticket channel on YouTube as driving forces. Its Google Cloud segment should see \u201cmeasured and gradual\u201d growth as customers prepare for AI deployments, Jefferies added.\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u2019 (AMD US) AI exposure will help drive sales 9.5% higher, in contrast to Qualcomm (QCOM US), which is seen revealing a stagnant topline when it reports Wednesday despite a rebound in its handset and automotive segments.\nStarbucks\u2019 (SBUX US) North American same-store sales growth is projected to about halve to 5.5% from the same period a year ago. Domestic sales were volatile in November and December amid union walkouts and social-media calls to boycott the coffee chain over its perceived response to the Israel-Hamas war, William Blair noted.\nGeneral Motors (GM US) deliveries were flat in the quarter as strikes cut output at four plants that make the automaker\u2019s top-selling models. Despite the dropoff \u2014 deliveries were up 41% the same period a year ago \u2014 profit could still beat expectations as US production likely outpaced sales to account for lost output during the strike, Bloomberg Intelligence said.\nUPS (UPS US) adjusted earnings per share will slide by double-digits for the fourth quarter in a row, weighed down by higher costs from its new labor contract and tepid shipping growth. Investors will want to gauge the firm\u2019s progress on winning back market share lost during fraught labor talks and hear about the impact of Red Sea shipping disruptions.\nWednesday: Boeing (BA US) will see operating profit of $287 million, snapping a five-quarter streak of losses on more commercial-aircraft deliveries and strong services demand. With its growth ambitions dented by the US Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s move to freeze planned production increases for the 737 Max aircraft, executives are set to face intense scrutiny on the company\u2019s next steps.\nMastercard (MA US) should be able to raise earnings per share by 16% for the quarter as cuts to expenses offset slowing revenue growth and increased buybacks. Company guidance for 2024 should be in line with consensus, Baird said.\nThursday: Apple (AAPL US) may score a modest beat on earnings estimates despite slowing sales in China, Evercore said, noting that a patent dispute involving its smartwatches should have little impact. Initial signs point to strong demand for the Vision Pro headset which, along with AI-driven features on its iPhones, could drive growth this year, Bank of America said. Investors will want more color on its overhaul of its App Store and iPhone features in the European Union to appease regulators..\nMeta\u2019s (META US) 2023 ad revenue growth was fueled by Chinese e-commerce platforms but whether the Facebook parent can rely on the likes of Shein and Temu this year remains to be seen, given simmering China-US tensions, BI said. Meta may also need to focus investments in its large-language model to improve ad targeting amid declining user engagement.\nAmazon (AMZN US) may beat expectations for a low-double-digit revenue gain \u2014 consensus calls for 11% \u2014 given a stronger-than-expected holiday season and sequentially improving sales at Amazon Web Services, BI said. The addition of ads to its Prime video service, along with its cloud order book and insights on consumer shopping trends, will be in focus.\nFriday: Exxon Mobil (XOM US) has warned of a $2.5 billion writedown in some of its California operations in guidance released this month. Gas trading and downstream-derivative tailwinds shored up its profits, TD Cowen said, though consensus estimates point to a 35% fall in earnings per share. Lower oil prices have also dragged Chevron\u2019s (CVX US) profits lower as earnings per share is seen retreating 21% with an LNG pricing uptick failing to offset lower refining margins.\nCharter Communications (CHTR US) investors may focus on broadband subscriber numbers after its fight with Walt Disney over fees left its pay-TV customers temporarily unable to view channels backed by the entertainment giant. Broadband revenue could still get a boost from better average revenue per user gains with the end of promotional discounts, BI said.\nCigna\u2019s (CI US) earnings per share likely jumped 32%, more than double the previous quarter\u2019s rate, amid a rise in medical customers and a largely stable medical loss ratio. Medical costs, forecast 10.6% higher in the quarter, is a concern, especially after health insurance peer Humana\u2019s recent move to cut its forecast on higher-than-anticipated expenses.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nChinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters\nThere\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets\nAI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

The budget marks a 4% increase over last year and is a $2 billion improvement from 2021 spending.\nThe foundation added that it remains committed to increasing its annual spending to $9 billion by 2026.\nA major focus for the foundation, it says, has been \"reducing inequities in health by funding the development of new tools and strategies to reduce the burden of infectious diseases and the leading causes of child mortality in low-income countries.\"\nBased on its research, the Gates Foundation says the world has cut child deaths from more than 9.3 million a year in 2000 to 4.6 million a year in 2022.\nMeanwhile, deaths from malaria and HIV were cut in half during the past two decades. Wild polio, which had been paralyzing 350,000 children a year, has been reduced to only 12 cases in two countries, says the Gates Foundation.\nHowever, Gates added, \"The last few years with the pandemic, our progress [on healthcare] has plateaued.\"\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The company doesn't provide guidance in its statement, we have to wait for the call for that. Interesting to see the shares pulling back a little bit.\nAlso, what caught my eye here was the commentary from Satya Nadella in this statement.

And the question investors and financial analysts, financial analysts have been trying to figure out is, OK, how much does that now pad, Julie, the top and bottom line in the quarters and years ahead.\nAzure will also be in focus, of course. The question there is, what do you see ahead? What do you, what acceleration do you think you could look for in the quarters ahead.

If you look across other types of areas, office commercial products and cloud services revenue up 15%, server products and cloud services revenue up 22%, one of the bigger places.\nBut again, I'm really curious, where exactly did they see Copilot feed into some of that revenue, and feed some of that demand as well as some of the demand for Azure et cetera.

        "Text": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\nMicrosoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella\u00a0is reportedly set for a trip to\u00a0India on Feb. 7 and\u00a08, with a focus on exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) opportunities for the year ahead, as reported by Moneycontrol.\nAn internal email, dispatched a few weeks earlier by\u00a0Puneet Chandok, the\u00a0President of Microsoft India and\u00a0South Asia, underscored that Nadella's visit is a reaffirmation of Microsoft's commitment to harness technology to broaden opportunities in India.\nAs per the email, AI is taking center stage in shaping \"India's Techade,\"\u00a0positioning India and South Asia\u00a0as a hotspot for technological advancements.\nThe significance of this visit traces back to June 2023 when Indian Prime Minister\u00a0Narendra Modi\u00a0visited the U.S. Meetings were held with top technology executives, including Apple's\u00a0Tim Cook, Google's\u00a0Sundar Pichai, and Nadella. The crux of these discussions, as stated in Nadella's office statement, revolved around\u00a0harnessing the power of technology,\u00a0especially AI, to enhance\u00a0the lives of Indians and\u00a0capitalize on India's dynamic developer and startup ecosystems.\nSee Also:\u00a0Govt Will Hold Social Media Firms Like Meta, Google Responsible For Deepfakes As Elections Get Closer: Report\nFounders of notable Indian AI\u00a0startups, such as Lightspeed and Peak XV-supported Sarvam, Bhavish Aggarwal's AI startup Krutrim, and various early-stage AI startups, are reportedly preparing\u00a0to meet Nadella in Mumbai\u00a0and Bangalore.\nIn October 2023, Nadella outlined Microsoft's\u00a0ambitious plans for AI in\u00a0its annual letter, following its\u00a0collaboration with OpenAI, the owner of\u00a0ChatGPT. Microsoft announced AI integrations\u00a0across\u00a0all Office 365 apps and\u00a0services in March 2023, introducing an AI assistant named Copilot powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 technology.\nIn May 2023, Microsoft further solidified its partnership with OpenAI by incorporating\u00a0the Bing search engine into\u00a0ChatGPT, positioning itself as a direct competitor to Google.\nThis reinforces the commitment of global tech giants like Microsoft to explore and invest in AI, and Nadella's upcoming visit is a testament to this ongoing endeavor.\nRead Next:\u00a0Adani Ent 'Too Big To Ignore': U S Brokerage Sees 51% Upside For Firm\nPhoto by WEF on Flickr\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nMICROSOFT (MSFT): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Reportedly Gearing Up For India Visit With Focus On AI Opportunities originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman talk about the balance in the job market as more corporations seek to implement job cuts.\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\nJOSH LIPTON: Microsoft reportedly telling employees it will cut nearly 2,000 2 roles across Activision Blizzard and Xbox just months after it closed its merger with the video game company. And Paramount CEO Bob Bakish indicated layoffs would be coming in a memo to employees. So this is certainly a trend, Julie, we've seen making headlines, this trend of layoffs, for sure in tech, specifically.\nAnd actually, The Journal has kind of this running list of companies that have already announced layoffs this year within tech. And already this year, Google, eBay, Rent the Runway, Wayfair, Xerox have announced thousands of layoffs, collectively at least. We actually spoke recently to LinkedIn economist kind of about this trend, specifically just in tech. And he told us what he's seeing in terms of his platform. Take a listen to that.\nKORY KANTENGA: Like a lot of things in the US economy, layoffs are seasonal. They primarily happen in January. The second thing to keep in mind is that overall, when we look at the data both at LinkedIn and at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor market seems pretty steady and stable.\nJOSH LIPTON: So it was interesting, at least his take. And again, he's looking at his platform and across the economy. He was not sounding the alarm. At least when it comes to tech, he was kind of arguing that seasonality was playing a real variable when it comes to the layoffs we were seeing in this sector. And I think there's probably some other trends, too. You can talk about the post-pandemic adjustments these companies are making. The boom of AI I'm sure has a lot of them kind of reconsidering who they hire, when they hire, where to commit resources. But it's a trend, and we keep watching it.\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And, you know, reallocation of resources to your point, I think, is a big part of this. You had IBM as one of the companies saying over the past 24 hours that it's going to cut some percentage of jobs this year in the low single digits. But that it actually because of other additions is going to have the same number of employees at year's end as they do now.\nSo you have to look at the net numbers, obviously, when you're talking about layoffs. You can't just look at the numbers that are being cut without the numbers that are also being hired. And if you look kind of zoom out and look at what we have seen in the job market, first of all, we also got weekly jobless claims today. We are seeing those tick higher on the week-over-week basis and on the four-week rolling basis.\nBut if you look at the bigger tally of layoffs from the JOLTS report that comes out, you've definitely seen that we're not back to levels where we were. Yes, there was a spike during the pandemic in layoffs. There was also sort of not a spike but a surge during the financial crisis. But we're not near those levels at this point in terms of those layoffs.\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah. I know with tech, too, you know, you do hear people asking the question, could it be kind of foreshadowing what's coming? Is it kind of maybe a canary in the coal mine? But to your point, right now, I mean, broadly, this labor market is still sturdy. I mean, it's sub-4-- sub-4% unemployment, wage is growing.\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. So it doesn't feel that way yet.\n"

IDC reporting iPhone shipments fell 2.1% in China last quarter adding to demand concerns right now. The shares flat just barely to the upside right now.\nSEANA SMITH: All right. Nokia shares jumping this morning, despite reporting a double-digit decline in sales. Also, a drop in profit in the fourth quarter. Investors, though, they seem optimistic about their planned turnaround-- their expected recovery, I should say, and also, future cost controls.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is doubling down on its commitment to AI with the introduction of a new keyboard key dedicated specifically to the company\u2019s Windows Copilot. The first update to the Windows PC keyboard in almost 30 years, the Copilot key will be available on laptops and desktop keyboards from Microsoft\u2019s OEM partners beginning in February.\nAccording to Microsoft corporate vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi, pressing the key will bring up Copilot, allowing you to search for content on the web, as well as for your own content and for general PC features via the app\u2019s generative AI functionality. The idea is for Copilot to function as a kind of smart assistant that you can pull up at any time.\nWhile Microsoft didn\u2019t announce any specific partners that will launch with the Copilot key, it said that companies should begin unveiling desktops and laptops equipped with the feature in the coming days. We\u2019ll also get an up-close look at the capability at CES 2024, which kicks off Jan. 9.\nBy getting its hardware partners to add a Copilot key to their laptops and desktops, Microsoft is showing that it believes generative AI is inextricable from the future of personal computing. The last time Microsoft added a new keyboard key was when it debuted the Windows key in 1994.\nMicrosoft spent much of 2023 making a series of AI announcements ranging from the debut of its Bing chatbot and Edge browser to its Copilot for Microsoft 365. CEO Satya Nadella has said that advancements in AI will impact nearly every part of the company\u2019s business.\nSemiconductor giants are also getting in on the AI movement. AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each debuted their own AI PC chips with dedicated neural processors designed to handle AI-specific tasks such as running generative AI applications.\nHow much consumers will benefit from those chips, though, is still up in the air. Even Intel doesn\u2019t know exactly what kinds of apps developers will eventually cook up that rely on or take advantage of neural processors.\nThe AI PC movement comes at a time when the PC market is expected to return to growth for the first time since 2021, according to Goldman Sachs Equity Research analyst Michael Ng.\n\u201cIn our view, global PC shipments in 2024 will be driven by the beginning of a refresh cycle as pandemic-purchased devices start to reach four years of age & new AI-capable PCs come to market (later in 2024) in what we view as the first technological shift in personal computing since the widespread adoption of smartphones/tablets,\u201d Ng wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nThe expected resurgence in PC sales follows years of declines after an explosion of growth at the onset of the pandemic. At that time, consumers and businesses, eager to get their hands on PCs to work and play, purchased new laptops and desktops in droves.\nAs those systems age, however, consumers will begin buying up newer PCs, which will help drive AI PC adoption. And that will inevitably help Microsoft, as well as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm\u2019s bottom lines.\nRead more coverage from CES 2024:\nNvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power gaming and AI efforts at CES 2024\nAMD debuts AI-focused Ryzen 8000G desktop chips at CES 2024\nMicrosoft is adding an AI button to PC keyboards, their first major change in 30 years\nFrom AI to flying cars, here\u2019s what to expect at CES 2024\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "The fight is on in 2024's first trading week as Microsoft (MSFT) dukes it out with Apple for the title of most valuable US company. The tech giants' market caps are neck following two analyst downgrades to the iPhone maker's stock this week.\nYahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jared Blikre observes the two tech companies, also discussing Apple's prior history of annual sales growth.\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, Microsoft is about $100 billion away from overtaking Apple as the most valuable company in the US. This comes after two analysts downgraded Apple this week. \"Yahoo Finance's\" own Jared Blikre is here to break it down for us. The battle of the tech giants, Jared.\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And Thank. You for the introduction there. Here is a market cap over the last five years of these two giant companies. And by the way, they're very different companies. But we can compare them. Apple is in purple here. It's currently on top. And here is its $3 trillion plus peak. And here is Microsoft in cyan, just a little bit lower right now. But you can see Microsoft, at times, over the last five years has led Apple for brief periods of time, including coming out of those pandemic lows.\nBut really you go back 10, 20, 30, 40 years and you can really see the difference between those two companies. I'm going to compare now the stock prices of these two companies over the last 10 years. You can see Apple's up 842%. Microsoft is up 904%. So neck and neck right there with Microsoft a slight edge.\nYou look at the 20-year chart. What happened? Apple's up 45,000%. Microsoft up 1,200%. I think a lot of investors would take that. But essentially, if you had to buy 2008 to 2010 to reach any comparable number with Apple, and if you got in between 2000 and 2008, that was dead money. That was a losing trade. And that's because in the wake of the tech bubble, and also the antitrust suit that Microsoft was facing 20 years ago, it just became dead money for about a decade.\nLet me now show you the story in terms of sales growth. This is Apple sales growth going back into the late '90s. This is when Steve Jobs took over. And let's not forget, Apple was left for dead, almost went bankrupt. How about that? But this incredible years-- these years of sales growth here, a lot of them topping 75%. That's the iPod. And then that's the iPhone. And you can see things have trailed off. The services side of the equation has gotten a lot of play here, but it doesn't always live up to expectations.\nRight now, four quarters of declining revenue growth. That is a negative situation for Apple. Expectations are for that to be broken. But we'll have to see how this plays out in earnings season. Give it another month.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Looking forward to that. Our very own Jared Blikre. Thank you so much.\n"

She has already begun attending board meetings, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private matters. OpenAI and Microsoft declined to comment.\nDays after OpenAI\u2019s board ousted Sam Altman as CEO in November, the startup agreed to reinstate him, replace all but one of its directors and give a nonvoting observer seat to Microsoft, its biggest investor. OpenAI\u2019s current directors are Bret Taylor, the former co-CEO of Salesforce Inc.; Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary; and Adam D\u2019Angelo, a holdover from the previous board and the CEO of question-and-answer site Quora Inc.\nAltman previously said a new board will be selected \u201cfairly quickly.\u201d He did not specify how many people will eventually be part of the group, but said it will be \u201csignificantly enlarged\u201d from the current number. OpenAI has faced some criticism for not having any women on the initial board.\nTempleton joined Microsoft in 1998 as its first female technical employee at the company\u2019s New Zealand office, according to her LinkedIn profile. In her current role, she reports to Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer and leads a team managing some of the company\u2019s technical partnerships, including its work with OpenAI.\nThe Information previously reported Templeton was one of the people in consideration for the board role.\nMicrosoft has committed to invest some $13 billion in OpenAI and integrated its products into its core businesses, quickly becoming the AI leader among big tech firms. But Microsoft, like other investors, was caught off guard by the OpenAI board\u2019s decision to oust Altman.\nIn late November, after Altman was reinstated, Microsoft President Brad Smith told reporters that the changes to OpenAI\u2019s corporate governance \u201care giving us more confidence.\u201d But in taking an observer position on the board, Microsoft could also add to scrutiny of its close relationship with the startup.

        "Title": "Estimating The Fair Value Of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft's estimated fair value is US$372 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$389 suggests Microsoft is potentially trading close to its fair value\n The US$419 analyst price target for MSFT is 13% more than our estimate of fair value\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$65.8b\nUS$79.1b\nUS$95.1b\nUS$113.0b\nUS$133.1b\nUS$147.9b\nUS$160.4b\nUS$171.0b\nUS$180.0b\nUS$187.9b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x25\nAnalyst x26\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 11.14%\nEst @ 8.46%\nEst @ 6.59%\nEst @ 5.28%\nEst @ 4.36%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% \nUS$61.4k\nUS$68.8k\nUS$77.1k\nUS$85.4k\nUS$93.8k\nUS$97.2k\nUS$98.3k\nUS$97.7k\nUS$95.9k\nUS$93.3k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$869b\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$188b\u00d7 (1 + 2.2%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.2%) = US$3.8t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$1.9t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.8t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$389, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.006. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.However, More Personal Computing revenues are suffering from continued weakness in Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. Also, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The most recent trading session ended with Microsoft (MSFT) standing at $396.51, reflecting a -0.54% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.22%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.36%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.32%.\nShares of the software maker witnessed a gain of 6.43% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 3.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.61%.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Microsoft in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2024. On that day, Microsoft is projected to report earnings of $2.76 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 18.97%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $61.03 billion, indicating a 15.71% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $11.14 per share and a revenue of $242.41 billion, representing changes of +13.56% and +14.39%, respectively, from the prior year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Microsoft. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.12% higher. As of now, Microsoft holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nWith respect to valuation, Microsoft is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 35.78. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 33.59.\nIt's also important to note that MSFT currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.31. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.3.\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 103, putting it in the top 41% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups.

        "Author": "  Jackie Davalos ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- When Microsoft Corp. announced it was baking ChatGPT into its Bing search engine last February, bullish analysts declared the move an \u201ciPhone moment\u201d that could upend the search market and chip away at Google\u2019s dominance.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nChina Weighs Stock Market Rescue Package Backed by $278 Billion\nApple Dials Back Car\u2019s Self-Driving Features and Delays Launch to 2028\nAn Isolated Israel Doubles Down on War in Gaza \u2014 At All Costs\nNetflix Pays $5 Billion for \u2018Raw\u2019 in Bet on Live Events\nTurkey Approves Sweden NATO Bid, Leaving Hungary as Holdout\n\u201cThe entire search category is now going through a sea change,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said at the time. \u201cThat opportunity comes very few times.\u201d\nAlmost a year later, the sea has yet to change.\nThe new Bing \u2014 powered by OpenAI\u2019s generative AI technology \u2014 dazzled internet users with conversational replies to queries asked in a natural way. But Microsoft\u2019s search engine ended 2023 with just 3.4% of the global search market, according to data analytics firm StatCounter, up less than 1 percentage point since the ChatGPT announcement.\nBing has long struggled for relevance and attracted more mockery than recognition over the years as a serious alternative to Google. Multiple rebrandings and redesigns since its 2009 debut did little to boost Bing\u2019s popularity. A month before Microsoft infused the search engine with generative AI, people were spending 33% less time using it than they had 12 months earlier, according to SensorTower.\nThe ChatGPT reboot at least helped reverse those declines. In the second quarter of 2023, US monthly active users more than doubled year over year to 3.1 million, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of SensorTower mobile app data. Overall, users were spending 84% more time on the search engine, the data show. By year-end, Bing\u2019s monthly active users had increased steadily to 4.4 million, according to SensorTower.\nTo build on the momentum, Microsoft has been adding more AI tools to Bing. In October, the company integrated the latest version of OpenAI\u2019s image-generating model, DALL-E 3. Visitors can use it to create realistic-looking images with simple text prompts.\nThe offering does nothing to enhance Bing\u2019s search abilities. But its addition generated a spike in usage, according to Jordi Ribas, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of search and AI.\n\u201cWe noticed an increase in usage by 10 times and that took us by surprise because if you think about it, DALL-E 2 was already quite good,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt really made a difference in the engagement and the users that came to our product.\u201d\nYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft\u2019s consumer chief marketing officer, declined to specify how many active users Bing has.\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s still early days and new behaviors are being built,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning new things, but have millions and millions of people using the new tools.\u201d\nEven as the Bing team adds crowd-pleasers, Google has been racing to develop its own AI tools. In May, it launched an experimental version of its search engine called the \u201csearch generative experience,\u201d which delivers conversational responses atop the familiar list of links. Dubbed SGE for short, it\u2019s still not widely available. However, Google plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into SGE sometime this year.\nThe Alphabet Inc. division also retains considerable advantages. It has more than 90% of the market and is the default search engine on Apple Inc. hardware, including iPhones, giving Google crucial critical mass. The more people who use it, the more the search engine knows and the more Google can use that data to deliver and rank results in a way people find useful.\nThe retooling of search by both technology giants reflects a shared conviction that generative AI will fundamentally change the way people seek and receive answers online. For Microsoft, the shift is an opportunity to propel Bing forward. But the incremental gains so far make clear that buzzy AI features alone probably won\u2019t transform it into a formidable search player.\n\u201cWe are at the gold rush moment when it comes to AI and search,\u201d said Shane Greenstein, an economist and professor at Harvard Business School, who has studied the commercialization of the internet. \u201cAt the moment, I doubt AI will move the needle because, in search, you need a flywheel: the more searches you have, the better answers are. Google is the only firm who has this dynamic well-established.\u201d\nStill, Greenstein said Bing, being the underdog, has more latitude to experiment. \u201cGoogle has to be careful not to hurt its brand and product when it comes to testing new AI tools,\u201d he said. \u201cBing can afford to take the risk. It has nothing to lose.\u201d\nMicrosoft is also betting that generative AI will change how advertisers allocate their search spending. The current ad model rests on costs-per-click, but AI-powered searches are getting consumers to answers faster and more directly without a litany of blue links, according to marketing chief Mehdi.\n\u201cWe have advertisers telling us they\u2019re getting better outcomes as a result of our AI efforts and are deeply interested in how this works,\u201d he said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Sweden Quit Smoking Without Quitting Nicotine\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.\nShould I Tell My Colleagues (or My Boss) About My Bipolar Diagnosis?\nIt\u2019s the Tesla Earnings Call\u2014Time for Elon Musk Bingo\nThe Bitcoin Hype Is Back and About Just as Hollow as Before\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

We're watching the big tech stocks. Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple all set to report results this week. Akiko, I'm zoning in on Amazon, so they're reporting on Thursday. I think it'll give us a really good look at a mix of things. You have the consumer demand that we're seeing, especially after Amazon touted its record-breaking holiday sales.\nOf course, you have streaming, you have sports, you have cloud in relation to AI, as well that I'll be looking at. And, of course, the new rollout of its ad-supported tier that MoffettNathanson lead analyst Michael Morton called the 500-pound gorilla entering the room.

That's the number we're going to be watching closely. But some interesting headlines today, Rachelle, coming ahead of those results with that acquisition of iRobot, really coming to a halt here. Essentially, not going through because of regulatory concerns on that front. So some headlines there as well.\nAs you pointed out with Amazon, it's always interesting to get the consumer pulse as well, at least on the e-commerce side. So we'll be watching that one closely. I'm watching Microsoft really closely for very obvious reasons when you think about the big tech rally that we have seen. It has come on the back of this optimism around AI. And you could argue, Microsoft, a big driver of that, hitting that $3 trillion market cap.\nOf course, when you think about where Microsoft is in its AI rollout, you've got that Copilot key already integrated into PCs that are coming out, as well. Microsoft has said that's just the beginning in terms of the user experience. So we'll be looking for some hints on what additional measures that are likely, one additional features that Microsoft is hinting at.\nAnd, of course, the bottom line here, investors are going to be asking, well, what does that revenue look like that's coming in from AI? So certainly, a lot going across the board. But just given the run up that we have seen in Microsoft, as well as other mega-cap stocks, certainly, going to be a consequential week here with all those big tech companies' results reporting this week.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, and when you look at where valuations are, and then you look at where Microsoft is now, I mean, a year from now, we wouldn't have thought that generative AI would have really pushed it past Apple, where we think of-- when we think of market cap and the potential for it to overtake it. But when I think of Apple. you think it has that nice, secure moat. But then we saw that slowdown in demand. We saw people not buying as many devices.\nAnd as we've been talking about, we have that upgrade cycle that's also coming up, which could also be an additional boon for Microsoft, as well. So interesting positioning here. Definitely, be an earnings call I'll be excited to listen in on.\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, you mentioned Apple reporting later this week.

Welcome to Good Buy or Goodbye. Our goal, to help cut through that noise and navigate the best moves for your portfolio.\nToday, we're diving into the Magnificent Seven. And while the mega-cap effect powered last year's returns for markets, with a new year comes a new perspective. So what's the best way to play it now? I am here with Ray Wang. He is the Constellation Research founder and principal analyst.\nAnd Ray, your buy is on Amazon. First of all, give that away. And then you have a couple of reasons to support your claim. What is your bullish case here?\nRAY WANG: Yeah, my bull case is because the run up isn't in on Amazon. But we're looking at Amazon versus Microsoft. And when you think about what's going on here, right, Amazon has been doing amazing.\nAnd the first one is really they're done making the investment, right? They've done $200 billion of investments in capital. That means the free cash flow has been really bad, but we're now on the other end of that. And when we look at that, you're going to see the ability for them to actually put that free cash flow to use. Not just online profits, acquisitions, reinvestment, but more importantly, you're going to see that in profits.\nJARED BLIKRE: All right--\nRAY WANG: And you're going to see that in the--\nJARED BLIKRE: I want to hold it right there because I actually have a chart of free cash flow. This is the actual in cyan here versus the estimate this goes back to 2014, so about 10 years. You can see the estimates got a little bit out of touch with reality, came down.\nThey met reality, it went below. And now it's off to the moon. So this is kind of what you're talking about here.\nRAY WANG: Exactly and that's where we're going to see a lot of those gains.\nJARED BLIKRE: OK, great. We also have, as another potential risk here-- or excuse me, another potential bullish risk, most diversified streams of digital monetization. So they're finally going down that path of monetizing more in different ways. Can you tell us how?\nRAY WANG: Well, so here's the beauty of it, right? It's ads, goods, search, services, memberships, and subscriptions. Well, think about it, the number three player in ads is Amazon out of nowhere.\nFive years ago, you wouldn't be talking about Amazon in ads. And of course, we know they're in goods, they're in memberships, subscriptions, and services, and they've done a killer job there. They're the only one of the Magnificent Seven that have all six of those digital monetization models.\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, and we're also taking a look-- you are-- at AI. And you're just coming from CES. We'll talk about that in another segment, but AI is the thing over the last year. Automation not priced into the base case. How does-- how does that work for Amazon?\nRAY WANG: And so here's the interesting point, all the AI that we tend to think about with NVIDIA, with Microsoft, with Google, actually Amazon has a lot of it. Not just in AWS, but they're putting it to use in commerce. And if you've ever seen one of their warehouses, there's a lot going on in the background with automation. That is actually going to give them more leverage than most people are seeing right now.\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, easy to forget how big they are in logistics. Anyway, we got to go to some of the risks here and one of those is regulatory. We've heard the DOJ and antitrust concerns kind of coming up in recent years. What about that front?\nRAY WANG: I'm worried about DOJ. If we have the same administration going into the next election out of 2025, there's going to be huge regulatory issues coming out of FTC, DOJ. If we have a change in leadership, then I would take that risk off the table. Right now, I'm betting that the risk off the table, it's like a 50/50. Nobody knows where it's going to head.\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I'd say pretty fair with that. We don't know where that's going to go. We got to talk about Microsoft here, one stock to avoid. Are we saying goodbye here?\nRAY WANG: I'm saying goodbye only because the run up has already been there. For a lot of people, they've invested in Microsoft, it's been an amazing ride. Satya is an amazing CEO.\nBut here's some of the challenges, right? One of them right now is when you think about it, massive competition in AI. Microsoft started a war with Google last January that they thought they were going to win because they thought they caught Google flat footed. The answer is Google kicked back and they kicked back really hard.\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, and we're also taking a look at valuation. You just said pretty much that they run up. They got a lot of price increase last year. Do you think that's it for them?\nRAY WANG: No, there's still a little bit more. And they may be the most valuable company in the world for another five, six months, but at that point the question is, what's next? And every investor asks, will they be able to deliver on what's next?\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, and then quality complaints. Where is that coming from?\nRAY WANG: If you've been on a Teams call recently, you know how shoddy that is. If you're asking for more capacity in the Western region, customers are not getting compute capacity. They've done such a good job selling, now they've got to actually focus on delivery.\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, now how do we turn this into the bull case? It looks like monetization is part of the deal with respect to AI.\nRAY WANG: You know, ChatGPT, OpenAI, all those capabilities, you know, that's where Microsoft is winning. Copilots applications, being able to do it in an office. Every person that codes is using it, especially when you're looking at GitHub, they're getting the benefits of that and that speed. And that's for-- that's the bull case.\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, so you're telling us here you want to buy Amazon as AI and automation not yet priced into the base case for the stock and then more free cash flows is on the horizon. And on the other side, you're saying avoid Microsoft amid steep AI competition and the run up in valuation already played out on the AI monetization front. Ray Wang, thank you.\nStick around, we're going to be hitting more on some of these tech themes and rivalries on the other side of the break. But that's going to do it for the latest installment of Good Buy or Goodbye. Look out for new episodes three times a week at 3:30 PM, Eastern.\n"

Welcome to Good Buy or Goodbye. Our goal, to help cut through that noise and navigate the best moves for your portfolio.\nToday, we're diving into the Magnificent Seven. And while the mega-cap effect powered last year's returns for markets, with a new year comes a new perspective. So what's the best way to play it now? I am here with Ray Wang. He is the Constellation Research founder and principal analyst.\nAnd Ray, your buy is on Amazon. First of all, give that away. And then you have a couple of reasons to support your claim. What is your bullish case here?\nRAY WANG: Yeah, my bull case is because the run up isn't in on Amazon. But we're looking at Amazon versus Microsoft. And when you think about what's going on here, right, Amazon has been doing amazing.\nAnd the first one is really they're done making the investment, right? They've done $200 billion of investments in capital. That means the free cash flow has been really bad, but we're now on the other end of that. And when we look at that, you're going to see the ability for them to actually put that free cash flow to use. Not just online profits, acquisitions, reinvestment, but more importantly, you're going to see that in profits.\nJARED BLIKRE: All right--\nRAY WANG: And you're going to see that in the--\nJARED BLIKRE: I want to hold it right there because I actually have a chart of free cash flow. This is the actual in cyan here versus the estimate this goes back to 2014, so about 10 years. You can see the estimates got a little bit out of touch with reality, came down.\nThey met reality, it went below. And now it's off to the moon. So this is kind of what you're talking about here.\nRAY WANG: Exactly and that's where we're going to see a lot of those gains.\nJARED BLIKRE: OK, great. We also have, as another potential risk here-- or excuse me, another potential bullish risk, most diversified streams of digital monetization. So they're finally going down that path of monetizing more in different ways. Can you tell us how?\nRAY WANG: Well, so here's the beauty of it, right? It's ads, goods, search, services, memberships, and subscriptions. Well, think about it, the number three player in ads is Amazon out of nowhere.\nFive years ago, you wouldn't be talking about Amazon in ads. And of course, we know they're in goods, they're in memberships, subscriptions, and services, and they've done a killer job there. They're the only one of the Magnificent Seven that have all six of those digital monetization models.\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, and we're also taking a look-- you are-- at AI. And you're just coming from CES. We'll talk about that in another segment, but AI is the thing over the last year. Automation not priced into the base case.

        "Title": "Will Microsoft Still Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently overtook Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as the world's most valuable company. As of this writing, Microsoft's market cap has reached $2.89 trillion and remains higher than Apple's market cap of $2.87 trillion.\nThis isn't the first time Microsoft's valuation eclipsed Apple's, but can it maintain that lead through the end of 2025? Let's take a fresh look at both tech giants to find out.\nApple's stock declined 4% over the past three months as its critics lamented its sluggish iPhone sales and lack of near-term catalysts. It still generated more than half of its revenue from the iPhone in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), but its handset sales declined 2% during the year as the 5G upgrade cycle ended. China's sluggish economy recovery and fierce currency headwinds exacerbated that pressure.\nApple's Mac sales also continued to slip in a post-pandemic market as fewer consumers upgraded their laptops and desktops. As a result, Apple's revenue dipped 3%, and its earnings per share stayed nearly flat for the full year.\nAnalysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 4% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as it laps that slowdown and the macro environment improves. The expansion of its services ecosystem, which already hosts more than 1 billion paid subscriptions, could also amplify that recovery.\nMoreover, the launch of its Vision Pro headset could gradually diversify its hardware business -- even if its $3,500 price tag limits its early adoption to affluent tech enthusiasts.\nApple's business remains broadly stable, while its $162 billion in cash and marketable securities gives it plenty of room to expand through investments and acquisitions. However, the lack of big near-term catalysts -- along with its stretched-forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28 -- are limiting its gains as the bulls rush toward more exciting growth plays.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's stock rose 19% over the past three months as it impressed the market with the growth of its cloud business, the expansion of its artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, and its takeover of Activision Blizzard.\nMicrosoft owns Azure, the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS). Azure notably grew at a much faster rate than AWS in its latest quarter, and its year-over-year revenue growth actually accelerated as AWS' revenue growth merely stabilized from its previous quarter.\nMicrosoft attributed that acceleration to the integration of OpenAI's AI tools into Azure and its other cloud services. Microsoft is also the top investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, making the Windows company one of the easiest ways to invest in the AI market.\nMicrosoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard should strengthen its Xbox business, add more games to its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming libraries, and ensure that it keeps pace with Sony and Nintendo in the console race.\nSimply put, the expansion of Microsoft's cloud, AI, and gaming businesses are offsetting the slower growth of its PC-oriented businesses and made it a more exciting investment than Apple. Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both grew 7% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), even as it faced tough currency headwinds and slower enterprise spending in this challenging macro environment. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to both grow 15% in fiscal 2024.\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft's shares might seem a bit pricier than Apple's. Nevertheless, its stronger growth and exposure to the AI market might easily justify that higher valuation.\nLooking further ahead, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 6% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2025. They expect Microsoft's revenue and earnings to both rise by another 15% in fiscal 2025.\nInvestors should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Apple needs to prove it can expand beyond the iPhone -- while Microsoft could continue to dazzle investors with the growth of its cloud and AI businesses. Therefore, I believe Microsoft has a clear shot at outperforming Apple throughout 2025 and widening its lead as the world's most valuable company.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The app gives users access to Copilot, formerly known as Bing Chat, which operates similarly to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nLike other AI chatbot, you can type in a question or a prompt and receive responses generated by artificial intelligence. Users can leverage the AI assistant to draft emails, compose stories or scripts, summarize complex texts, create personalized travel itineraries, write and update job resumes and more. Plus, You can use the app's Image Creator feature, which is powered by DALL\u00b7E 3, to explore new styles and ideas, curate social media content, develop brand motifs, generate logo designs, create custom backgrounds, build a portfolio, visualize film and video storyboards and more.\nImage Credits: Microsoft\n\"By combining the power of GPT-4 with the imaginative capabilities of DALL\u00b7E 3, Copilot not only enhances your design workflow, but can also bring your creativity to inspiring new heights,\" the app's description reads.\nSince the app's launch over the holidays, Copilot been downloaded more than 1.5 million times so far worldwide across both Android and iOS, according to data provided to TechCrunch by mobile intelligence provider, data.ai.\nWith Copilot, you're getting access to OpenAI's GPT-4 technology for free, which is pretty significant because OpenAI's GPT app runs on GPT-3.5 technology and charges for access to GPT-4.\nThe launch of Copilot on mobile comes as Microsoft rebranded Bing Chat to Copilot back in November. It's worth noting that prior to the launch of Copilot on mobile, you could access similar functionality via the Bing Chat feature on the Bing app. It's possible that Microsoft may plan to replace the Bing app with the Copilot app, but the tech giant hasn't shared anything on that front so far.\nThe mobile launch also comes as Copilot has already been available on the web for some time now. With this latest launch, Microsoft is looking to offer Copilot as a standalone service and expand its reach even more.\nMicrosoft brings Copilot to Windows 10\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/03/microsoft-copilot-is-now-available-on-ios-and-android/\n"

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO, January 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--There\u2019s a shift in the way Microsoft Teams users communicate, and Clerk Chat, a leading conversational messaging platform, is at the forefront of this technological advancement. Clerk Chat enables native integration into Microsoft Teams for SMS text messaging and WhatsApp.\nMicrosoft Teams, with over 271 millions users, serves as both a leading collaboration platform and a unified communications powerhouse. Embraced by more than 15 million companies daily, it excels as a UCaaS platform, particularly for remote work, functioning as a virtual workspace. The platform offers robust calling and productivity features, including chat, audio/video calls, virtual meetings, and real-time document sharing.\nHowever, one area where Microsoft Teams falls short is not providing a native SMS texting solution, and when many companies transition from Zoom Phone, RingCentral, 8x8, Dialpad and other VoIP providers, they find themselves hand-tied when they cannot text.\nAnd now, with Clerk Chat\u2019s ability to natively integrate with Teams, users can finally make both calls and send SMS to people outside of their organization, whether it be clients or customers, using their existing business phone number. There is no more need to choose multiple providers for texting and calling - Clerk Chat, through its Operator Connect partnership with Tier1 telecom providers, is able to provide seamless communication services. Clerk Chat\u2019s solution is powered by Bandwidth, the main carrier for Microsoft Teams calling, which allows you to avoid lengthy and messy porting processes. In fact, customers can bring their existing Teams phone numbers with absolutely no disruption to calling.\nBringing messaging to Microsoft\u2019s calling customers allows businesses to tap into the most popular channels of communication: SMS and WhatsApp. Companies can confirm appointments, schedule automated messages, and dominate voice or text-based customer service - all while ensuring compliance\u00b9 due to Clerk Chat\u2019s SOC2 Type2 certification.\nFrom an outside perspective, Clerk Chat appears to be effortlessly building the future of communication. \"We enable a multi-channel approach that allows businesses to speak to their customers via their channels of preference,\" said Igor Boshoer, Chief Technical Officer and Co-Founder of Clerk Chat. \"The telecommunication component, integrating within Operator Connect, is really the backbone of powering those channels in a really elegant way for those businesses - we\u2019re able to meet the most rigorous compliance standards by encrypting the messages as well.\"\nIntegrating Clerk Chat into Microsoft Teams for SMS and voice streamlines communication, saving time and eliminates channel-switching. And, with Operator Connect, which revolutionizes connectivity, businesses simplify PSTN integration directly in Teams, gaining access to Clerk Chat's technical expertise, secure products and services, and its reliable infrastructure - all while still receiving capabilities of Microsoft\u2019s software support.\n\"We're really trying to be at the forefront of defining a secure digital landscape as a company,\" said Will Chertoff, Vice President of Engineering and Co-Founder of Clerk Chat. \"It\u2019s integral for businesses to feel confident and be able to trust their sensitive data with a reputable messaging provider.\"\nFor more information about Clerk Chat\u2019s seamless integration with Microsoft Teams, please visit https://clerk.chat/teams/.\n\u00b9 https://clerk.chat/blog/fedramp-government-sms/\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240110260302/en/\nContacts\nMedia:Jill BerkowitzContent AssociateClerk Chat888-572-5374jill@clerk.chat clerk.chat\n"

Just think of what has happened to Boeing, which five years ago ranked in the top 20 of Fortune\u2019s World\u2019s Most Admired all-stars.\u00a0These days it\u2019s the butt of screw-loose jokes.\u00a0Meanwhile Nvidia has soared up the list over the last\u00a0four years, landing at No. 10 in our latest ranking, out this morning.\u00a0Ask anyone at either company if these reputational changes matter, and they will tell you:\u00a0They do. Big time.\nWhich is why Fortune\u2019s annual World\u2019s Most Admired Companies list deserves some attention.\u00a0The\u00a0more than\u00a03,700 executives, directors, and analysts polled in this effort by our partners at Korn Ferry don\u2019t, for the most part, have any special window into what\u2019s going on at these companies.\u00a0But they do have a good sense of how they are viewed by the people who matter. \nSo what can we learn from this year\u2019s list? Well first of all, when it comes to reputation, tech rules.\u00a0Apple is No. 1, Microsoft No. 2, and Amazon No. 3.\u00a0But that\u2019s why I think special credit should be given to legacy companies who continue to rank well.\u00a0Take Walmart, a company that many once thought would be defeated by the ascent of Amazon.\u00a0Instead, its\u00a0reputation continues to rise, hitting the No. 9 spot this year, up from 13 last year. (If, like me, you are fascinated by the Walmart-Amazon rivalry, I recommend Fortune reporter Jason Del Rey\u2019s excellent new book\u00a0Winner Sells All,\u00a0which you can buy on\u00a0Walmart.com or Amazon.com\u2014or buy a copy on both and compare the experience!)\nSo what else can you learn from this year\u2019s list? Well, kudos to Eli Lilly, which jumped onto the all-star list at No. 34 this year, and ended Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 10-year reign as the most admired pharmaceutical company.\u00a0And regrets to Disney, which fell to No. 12 from No. 6, and ceded its spot as the most admired entertainment company to Netflix.\u00a0(Note that the methodology for choosing\u00a0the top-ranked companies within industries\u00a0is different than that for choosing all-stars, which is why Netflix still ranks below Disney on the all-star list at No. 23.)\nCredit also goes to Moderna (No. 37), Mastercard (No. 40), L\u2019Oreal (No. 43), and\u00a0Adobe (No. 46),\u00a0which made the top 50 after not being ranked last year.\u00a0And bye-bye to last year\u2019s winners McDonald\u2019s, Nestle, Unilever, Lockheed Martin, and Charles Schwab, which dropped off the list.\nYou can explore the full list here.

This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "Title": "SymphonyAI Advances Strategic Generative AI Collaboration With Microsoft for Next-Generation Connected Retail",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Robust collaboration extends to SymphonyAI Retail Copilots on Microsoft Azure to increase productivity, collaboration, and business performance for category managers and supply chain demand planners\nPALO ALTO, Calif. & NEW YORK, January 14, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SymphonyAI, a leader in predictive and generative enterprise AI SaaS, has teamed with Microsoft to bring leading retail AI software applications using Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to retailers and CPGs worldwide, delivering rapid, in-depth insights, and paving the way for truly connected end-to-end retail. The collaboration was announced today at NRF 2024: Retail\u2019s Big Show in New York City.\nSymphonyAI\u2019s retail applications combine deep retail domain expertise with predictive and generative AI capabilities on Azure so retailers can make more effective decisions faster. SymphonyAI retail AI applications are built on fine-tuned, retail-specific LLMs and use Azure OpenAI Service to provide secure insight into customer datasets and linked external sources. With the recent announcement of the SymphonyAI Category Manager Copilot and Demand Planner Copilot, SymphonyAI is enabling retailers to tackle the toughest retail challenges faster and better.\nThe SymphonyAI Category Manager Copilot uses SymphonyAI\u2019s extensive retail LLM capabilities, combining decades of retail and CPG knowledge, processes, content, and customer segmentation to provide rapid insights into current customer merchandising and sales data. As a result, the Category Manager Copilot understands the intent of a user\u2019s questions to rapidly identify all performance-affecting factors in a product category and make recommendations about best actions to take. The copilot uses both text and graphics to quickly communicate insights and summaries, guiding users through different potential scenarios and assembling clear next steps. Using rapid insights from SymphonyAI Category Manager Copilot, category managers make better decisions faster, bringing category strategies to life and giving shoppers the items they want, when and where they want them.\nThe Demand Planner Copilot gives demand planners the ability to more accurately forecast optimized inventory quantities with a prioritized approach to understand, act, and communicate inventory requirements based on highly accurate AI-based forecasts. A retail demand planner is responsible for ensuring the right quantities of items are ordered to satisfy customer demands while minimizing waste. Because demand planners face time constraints on top of balancing inventory and supply chain issues, rapid decision making based on up-to-date information is critically important.\nWhen unforeseen demand shifts occur, demand planners are often unable to analyze, understand and mitigate the demand anomalies in time to offset the negative impact. The Demand Planner Copilot performs deep, rapid analysis to accurately pinpoint the cause of increased or decreased demand and provides mitigation recommendations. When new items are introduced into the assortment with no demand history to inform the forecast, the Demand Planner Copilot rapidly indexes master item repositories to match attributes of like items to generate forecasts that the planner could not have created without extensive manual research and incomplete assumptions.\n\"Leading retailers and CPGs worldwide have enthusiastically greeted the SymphonyAI Retail Copilots, inspired by their power to leapfrog current technology with game-changing productivity, collaboration, accuracy, and connectedness,\" said Manish Choudhary, President of SymphonyAI\u2019s Retail CPG division. \"At the end of the day, the copilots deliver the holy grail of retail effectiveness: increased customer engagement, enterprise-wide consistency localized for each store, and improved bottom-line results.\"\n\"SymphonyAI\u2019s retail solutions combine deep retail domain expertise with leading AI capabilities to deliver transformative, quantifiable business impact,\" said Kumar Abhimanyu, SVP of strategic partnerships at SymphonyAI. \"Exquisitely crafted to deliver success in today\u2019s challenging retail landscape, this innovative collaboration leverages predictive and generative AI on the Microsoft Azure platform to deliver a powerful productivity and efficiency boost for innovative retailers worldwide.\"\n\"Through integration with Azure OpenAI Service, SymphonyAI\u2019s retail applications will deliver measurable value to retailers and CPGs,\" said Keith Mercier, General Manager, Worldwide Retail & Consumer Goods, Microsoft. \"Next-generation predictive and generative AI tools can help transform retail by enhancing operational efficiency and supporting end-to-end connectivity from the store to corporate. We look forward to continuing our work with SymphonyAI to bring transformational productivity, accuracy, and shopper engagement to the retail and CPG industries with generative AI.\"\nRetailers and CPGs attending NRF can request a meeting and demo with SymphonyAI in booth #1441 to learn more about the collaboration with Microsoft and the power of predictive and generative AI solutions for retail.\nAbout SymphonyAI\nSymphonyAI is building the leading enterprise AI SaaS company for digital transformation across the most critical and resilient growth verticals, including retail, consumer packaged goods, finance, manufacturing, media, and IT/enterprise service management. SymphonyAI verticals have many leading enterprises as clients. Since its founding in 2017, SymphonyAI has grown rapidly to 3,000 talented leaders, data scientists, and other professionals.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is doubling down on its commitment to AI with the introduction of a new keyboard key dedicated specifically to the company\u2019s Windows Copilot. The first update to the Windows PC keyboard in almost 30 years, the Copilot key will be available on laptops and desktop keyboards from Microsoft\u2019s OEM partners beginning in February.\nAccording to Microsoft corporate vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi, pressing the key will bring up Copilot, allowing you to search for content on the web, as well as for your own content and for general PC features via the app\u2019s generative AI functionality. The idea is for Copilot to function as a kind of smart assistant that you can pull up at any time.\nWhile Microsoft didn\u2019t announce any specific partners that will launch with the Copilot key, it said that companies should begin unveiling desktops and laptops equipped with the feature in the coming days. We\u2019ll also get an up-close look at the capability at CES 2024, which kicks off Jan. 9.\nBy getting its hardware partners to add a Copilot key to their laptops and desktops, Microsoft is showing that it believes generative AI is inextricable from the future of personal computing. The last time Microsoft added a new keyboard key was when it debuted the Windows key in 1994.\nMicrosoft spent much of 2023 making a series of AI announcements ranging from the debut of its Bing chatbot and Edge browser to its Copilot for Microsoft 365. CEO Satya Nadella has said that advancements in AI will impact nearly every part of the company\u2019s business.\nSemiconductor giants are also getting in on the AI movement. AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each debuted their own AI PC chips with dedicated neural processors designed to handle AI-specific tasks such as running generative AI applications.\nHow much consumers will benefit from those chips, though, is still up in the air. Even Intel doesn\u2019t know exactly what kinds of apps developers will eventually cook up that rely on or take advantage of neural processors.\nThe AI PC movement comes at a time when the PC market is expected to return to growth for the first time since 2021, according to Goldman Sachs Equity Research analyst Michael Ng.\n\u201cIn our view, global PC shipments in 2024 will be driven by the beginning of a refresh cycle as pandemic-purchased devices start to reach four years of age & new AI-capable PCs come to market (later in 2024) in what we view as the first technological shift in personal computing since the widespread adoption of smartphones/tablets,\u201d Ng wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nThe expected resurgence in PC sales follows years of declines after an explosion of growth at the onset of the pandemic. At that time, consumers and businesses, eager to get their hands on PCs to work and play, purchased new laptops and desktops in droves.\nAs those systems age, however, consumers will begin buying up newer PCs, which will help drive AI PC adoption. And that will inevitably help Microsoft, as well as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm\u2019s bottom lines.\nRead more coverage from CES 2024:\nNvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power gaming and AI efforts at CES 2024\nAMD debuts AI-focused Ryzen 8000G desktop chips at CES 2024\nMicrosoft is adding an AI button to PC keyboards, their first major change in 30 years\nFrom AI to flying cars, here\u2019s what to expect at CES 2024\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "The fight is on in 2024's first trading week as Microsoft (MSFT) dukes it out with Apple for the title of most valuable US company. The tech giants' market caps are neck following two analyst downgrades to the iPhone maker's stock this week.\nYahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jared Blikre observes the two tech companies, also discussing Apple's prior history of annual sales growth.\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, Microsoft is about $100 billion away from overtaking Apple as the most valuable company in the US. This comes after two analysts downgraded Apple this week. \"Yahoo Finance's\" own Jared Blikre is here to break it down for us. The battle of the tech giants, Jared.\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And Thank. You for the introduction there. Here is a market cap over the last five years of these two giant companies. And by the way, they're very different companies. But we can compare them. Apple is in purple here. It's currently on top. And here is its $3 trillion plus peak. And here is Microsoft in cyan, just a little bit lower right now. But you can see Microsoft, at times, over the last five years has led Apple for brief periods of time, including coming out of those pandemic lows.\nBut really you go back 10, 20, 30, 40 years and you can really see the difference between those two companies. I'm going to compare now the stock prices of these two companies over the last 10 years. You can see Apple's up 842%. Microsoft is up 904%. So neck and neck right there with Microsoft a slight edge.\nYou look at the 20-year chart. What happened? Apple's up 45,000%. Microsoft up 1,200%. I think a lot of investors would take that. But essentially, if you had to buy 2008 to 2010 to reach any comparable number with Apple, and if you got in between 2000 and 2008, that was dead money. That was a losing trade. And that's because in the wake of the tech bubble, and also the antitrust suit that Microsoft was facing 20 years ago, it just became dead money for about a decade.\nLet me now show you the story in terms of sales growth. This is Apple sales growth going back into the late '90s. This is when Steve Jobs took over. And let's not forget, Apple was left for dead, almost went bankrupt. How about that? But this incredible years-- these years of sales growth here, a lot of them topping 75%. That's the iPod. And then that's the iPhone. And you can see things have trailed off. The services side of the equation has gotten a lot of play here, but it doesn't always live up to expectations.\nRight now, four quarters of declining revenue growth. That is a negative situation for Apple. Expectations are for that to be broken. But we'll have to see how this plays out in earnings season. Give it another month.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Looking forward to that. Our very own Jared Blikre. Thank you so much.\n"
