        "Title": "PC shipments fall in Q3 despite AI push by Microsoft, chipmakers",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "The global PC industry hit a snag in the third quarter, as worldwide shipments declined for the first time in three quarters \u2014 despite hype around so-called artificial intelligence PCs and growth in the US and Japan.\nAccording to Gartner, third quarter PC shipments, or devices sent out to retailers for sale, fell 1.3% year over year to 62.9 million units from 63.8 million units in the same period in 2023. Shipments dropped the most in China, with Gartner reporting a 10% collapse in demand in the country as government and state-affiliated entities sought out fewer desktops.\nShipments in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa took a less dramatic hit than China, dropping 1.5% due to a flurry of events that Gartner says distracted consumers, including elections in the UK and France and sporting events like the Olympics. The US, meanwhile, saw a 5.6% increase in shipments, while Japan saw double-digit growth in the quarter.\nStill, the PC industry is in the midst of a broader comeback after years of declines and the massive amount of growth it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. At the time, consumers and enterprises bought up virtually as many PCs as they could get their hands on to ensure they had the means to work and stay entertained while stuck in their homes for months on end.\nBut that boom meant people who might have been holding off on buying PCs ended up purchasing them sooner than they otherwise would have, pulling future sales forward. With so many customers outfitted with new PCs, demand crumbled, leading to an extended slump that lasted roughly two years, including the worst decline in 17 years in 2023. The slump hit companies ranging from PC manufacturers for Microsoft (MSFT) to chipmakers Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA).\nIn Q2 2023, as sales struggled, Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% year over year. Intel and AMD saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter 2023 Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million.\nThe shipment declines come as the PC industry is pushing the concept of AI PCs, or computers outfitted with neural processing units (NPUs) or high-powered graphics cards that can run AI applications locally rather than via the cloud.\nMicrosoft is pushing its own version of AI PCs it refers to as Copilot+ PCs, which meet certain hardware requirements such as powerful NPUs. But the marketing doesn\u2019t seem to be paying off.\nAccording to Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa, AI PCs \u201cdid not boost the demand for PCs since buyers have yet to see their clear benefits or business value.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, she said, the end of Windows 10 support in 2025 didn\u2019t drive updates in areas like China.\nThere\u2019s still plenty of debate about whether AI will become a huge selling point for consumer electronics, whether that\u2019s PCs or smartphones. So far, Microsoft has shown off a number of potentially useful AI features for Windows 11, including its Click to Do option that provides you with a context-sensitive set of options to take action on what you\u2019re viewing on your screen.\nMicrosoft says you can do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing, allowing the search engine to search for content based on images rather than words.\nBut it\u2019s not clear yet if AI is a major selling point for consumers. Jefferies recently downgraded Apple\u2019s stock saying that expectations for AI-powered iPhones are overblown. And if that holds true, you can bet it\u2019ll be the same for PCs.\nRegardless of the declines in Q3 or whether AI proves to be the kind of catalyst the industry needs, Kitagawa says PC shipments should improve for the year as a whole and blow up in 2025.\n\u201cAt the worldwide level, PC demand will see more uptake toward the end of 2024 and more robust growth in 2025, when the PC refresh will be at its peak,\u201d said Kitagawa.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nAs the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Goldman Sachs recently lowered the price target on the stock to $500 from $515 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The investment firm slightly lowered free cash flow expectations after Microsoft's fiscal 2026 and 2027 artificial intelligence capex estimates. However, as Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, Microsoft should execute well against Goldman's expectations for 14% revenue growth, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm said Microsoft\u2019s earnings growth is still 300 basis points faster than the S&P 500, which justifies the stock's valuation.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Safe Stocks To Invest In For The Long Term in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among 10 Safe Stocks To Invest In For The Long Term in 2024.\nThe recent market action can be attributed to the Fed\u2019s decision. To discuss the future of the equity market, Drew Pettit, Citi US equity strategist, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0on September 26, 2024.\nAccording to Pettit, the market is yet to hit an all-time high if you look beneath the surface. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s decision and if the potential softness in the labor data comes through, investors may regain confidence positioning the market for recovery. He adds that in the past quarter, cyclical and secular stocks have been performing well, but are yet to hit the market peak.\nSpeaking of growth sectors, some sectors have outperformed others, growing exponentially. Pettit adds that stocks with mature business models have yielded greater returns from minuscule upsides in sales. As for the tech sector, he believes that stocks will remain resilient and will be able to handle some deceleration. He advises investors to remain cautious of tech stocks moving forward and focus on overlooked areas of the market such as consumer goods, financials, and cyclicals.\nThe market saw a great run-up after the easing cycle. However, the question of a soft landing still stands. On September 30, Liz Young Thomas, SoFi head of investment strategy, appeared in an interview on\u00a0CNBC\u00a0to discuss the latest market trends and opportunities for investors.\nThomas believes that the maximum gains have already been achieved up until the easing cycle, however, growth may continue till the end of 2024. She stresses that the next 30 to 60 days are extremely crucial for the market and will help investors understand the motive behind the rate cuts, and whether the cuts were needed in the first place.\nWhile growth in the tech sector has been slowing down, other sectors have reportedly grown and more than 80% of the S&P 500 has been trading above the 200-day moving average. She adds that the tech sector has started to strengthen and the optimism surrounding the Chinese economy may combine to yield positive results for the market.\nThomas reiterates that while multiples are rich, to ensure a soft landing, the market must move to trade based on fundamentals rather than on multiples. She explains that this simply means that multiples are unlikely to expand from here, but earnings may get more steady. Sectors such as industrials have been growing and expanding while financials have been slower. Thomas advises investors to focus on stocks that have strong fundamentals and steady earnings growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the safest stocks to invest in for the long term in 2024 we consulted multiple reports and also screened for reliable growers using the Finviz stock screener. We compiled an initial list of 30 stocks. We then referred to the 10% year revenue growth rate for each of the stocks along with their history of dividend payouts. Companies with the highest growth rates and a history of dividend growth were included in the list. The 10 safe stocks to invest in for the long term in 2024 are in ascending order of their 10-year revenue growth rate.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n10 Year Revenue Growth: 10.94%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that develops productivity and business suite applications, cloud products, and personal computing products.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue worth $64.7 billion in FQ4 2024, up by 15% year-over-year. During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21%. Its productivity/business processes and intelligent cloud segment, on the other hand, logged revenue worth $20.3 billion and $28.5 billion respectively.\nThe company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. In July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies partnered to enhance and modernize Lumen\u2019s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy its suite of products in Microsoft Azure. Only last week, the company partnered with Rezolve AI to change the online retail landscape with AI-backed solutions.\nThe company\u2019s partnerships do not end here. BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX recently made a $100 billion deal to enhance the functioning of data centers and AI. The company is also expanding its footprint by establishing engineering development centers in Abu Dhabi, UAE. In addition to that, Microsoft invested a staggering EUR 4.3 billion to boost AI infrastructure and cloud usage in Italy.\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) financial strength coupled with its strategic partnerships in various industries make it one of the safest stocks to invest in for the long term. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. As of June 30, the\u00a0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust\u00a0is the most dominant shareholder in the company and has a position worth $15.6 billion, according to the Insider Monkey database.\nFred Alger Management\u2019s\u00a0Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of safe stocks to invest in for the long term in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of\u00a0 MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is bringing major updates to its Copilot artificial intelligence platform for Windows, expanding the software's capabilities with a number of new features, and introducing the ability to speak directly to the AI helper.\nThe announcements, which the company made at a press event at its Microsoft Experience Center in New York on Tuesday, also include a context-aware Click to Do option that provides you with tools and actions to complete tasks related to what you see on your screen, a refreshed version of Windows Search, the ability to upscale your old photos to up to 8K resolution, and an AI-powered edit tool for erasing or adding objects to your images.\nThe company also said it's working on a feature called Copilot Vision, which is able to view your Edge browser screen and understand questions you ask about what you're looking at.\nAll of these options come as Microsoft continues its AI push on both the consumer and enterprise sides of its business. The company launched its first wave of Copilot+ PCs in May, including its own Surface line of laptops and devices from partner companies including Dell, HP, and Lenovo.\nShares of Microsoft were off more than 1% on the day, in line with Tuesday's broader market trend.\nIn addition to its announcements on Tuesday, Microsoft also said it's preparing to roll out its previously delayed Recall feature for Windows 11. Recall is designed to capture screenshots of what you're doing on your computer, providing you with a kind of continuously updated visual library of the apps you've used and websites you've visited.\nSecurity researchers, however, objected to the app saying hackers could exploit it to steal user information. Microsoft has since updated the offering, saying it's improved its overall security and made it an opt-in service.\nThe new Click to Do feature provides you with a context-aware set of options to complete tasks for what you're looking at on your screen. Press the Windows key, and then click the mouse, and you'll get a pop-up toolbox that will let you do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing. Microsoft says the feature will also work with text, helping you to rewrite or summarize what you've written.\nThe improved Windows Search feature now allows you to search for files and photos using descriptions of what they may include rather than their actual names. So, if you're looking for a file about an article you've written about new Microsoft features, you can search using something like \"new Microsoft updates\" and Search should pull up the right file.\nMicrosoft's improved photo editing and image upscaling will help you take out unwanted objects from your photos, while Super resolution in Photos will improve the look of your older images, so you can grab those old shots you took on your first-generation iPhone and make them look like you shot them on the latest iPhone 16.\nThen there's Copilot Vision, which Microsoft says will only be available to a select set of Pro subscribers through Copilot Labs for now. During a pre-recorded demo, Microsoft showed how a user could speak to Copilot about shows they might want to watch while browsing the Rotten Tomatoes web page. The AI is able to look at the screen and make suggestions about what it sees, explaining to the user why they might enjoy certain TV shows or movies.\nMicrosoft says nothing is saved from your conversations with Copilot Vision after you end the session and the company won't train its AI using your chats.\nAll of these updates come ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. Adding new AI features just as PC sales are beginning to take off again should help drive consumers to Microsoft Copilot+ PCs. But Apple's (AAPL) own Apple Intelligence is also set to land on its Mac line of computers in the coming months, setting up an AI showdown for both company's laptop and desktop businesses.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States\u200b. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks.

In 2023, as the AI boom swept the US markets, the tech giant ramped up AI data center expenditures by 50% compared to the previous year, leaping far ahead of competitors like Amazon, whose spending decreased by about 3% that year. Since then, Microsoft has doubled down on this AI bet. This year, the company has partnered with global investment firm BlackRock to start a $100 billion fund to support AI data center growth with investments in energy and technology. It has also pledged more than $4 billion towards AI infrastructure investment in Italy. A report by Business Insider claims that the firm is on track to double data center capacity to 5GW this year.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best AI data center stocks to buy.

However, the general outlook for technology and AI is starting to improve as we near the end of 2024. On October 9, Dominic Rizzo, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his thesis for the AI industry.\nMost investors were disappointed after they failed to generate higher returns for their investments in AI during the second quarter of 2024. While Rizzo expects the theme to prevail for the next few quarters, he suggests that the technology and AI sector is on track to earn better returns, especially companies using artificial intelligence to improve their businesses.\nAs for the Magnificent Seven, while all companies have distinct business models and offerings, these companies have grown at a 50% to 100% faster rate than the rest of the market, making it reasonable to group them. Overall, Rizzo reiterates that while the group has been under immense pressure, it is well-positioned to leverage AI to its benefit.\nRizzo believes that AI is an innovation that is here to stay rather than a mere disruptive technology, meaning that companies using it to their benefit will most likely perform better than the ones that are not. Therefore, most if not companies have no other option but to direct investments in AI chips and GPUs. He expects the AI chip market to reach $400 billion by 2027.\nTechnology has been altering the world since humans came into being. On October 8, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO appeared in an interview on Bloomberg Television where he discussed the role of artificial intelligence, initial public offerings, and the easing cycle by the Fed.\nAccording to Dimon, technology was previously limited to certain regions and countries, but now we have tech centers in almost every part of the world including Berlin, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. According to Dimon, the acceleration in technology is great and he is glad that innovation is taking precedence, especially in Europe.\nSpeaking of AI, Dimon suggests that artificial intelligence is going to change a lot of things that are common elements of our world. As far as job losses go, technology has always been changing the job market and is mostly responsible for taking away jobs. However, he emphasizes the need to look at the bigger picture.\nOverall, Dimon suggests that jobs will likely be more enhanced and researched-oriented. As for sectors like finance, people have been using it to detect fraud and minimize risk already. Similarly, AI has limited a lot of marketing jobs but at the same time, it has left a positive impact on productivity. Dimon shares he is not worried about AI changing the job landscape and that we should focus on re-training and re-educating workers losing their jobs as new technologies keep springing.\nNow that we have studied the outlook of the AI industry, let's take a look at the most promising AI stocks to buy according to analysts.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the most promising AI stocks according to analysts, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising AI stocks based on the Analyst upside as of October 9, 2024. We also included the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. It is to be noted, that we only considered stocks with a market capitalization of over $1 billion, as of October 9, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21% year-over-year, and posted record bookings. The company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. Its AI-backed cloud service, Azure OpenAI service witnessed an increase in customer base by 60%, reaching 60,000 clients in the second quarter of 2024.\nPreviously in July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies signed a partnership to enhance and modernize Lumen\u2019s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy Palantir\u2019s suite of products in Microsoft Azure. In the past few weeks, the company initiated investments in other countries, signed new partnerships, and nurtured existing strategic partnerships. On October 8, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that Microsoft Azure is the first cloud to be running on NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell system backed by AI systems, further strengthening its position in AI.\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) outlook toward AI coupled with its strong cloud ecosystem makes it one of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\"\nOverall MSFT ranks 10th on our list of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of around $3 trillion. But lately, the stock's progress has stalled. In the past six months, its share price has fallen by 3%, and its year-to-date gains of 10% trail the S&P 500, which is up by 20%).\nThe tech giant has benefited from its timely investments in artificial intelligence (AI), and it has bolstered its products and services with new AI capabilities. But while the business is doing well, it may not be performing at a high enough level to attract more growth investors, given the stock's already-expensive valuation.\nHas Microsoft's stock hit a peak, or is it overdue for a rally?\nIf you believe Wall Street analysts, you might be bullish on Microsoft stock in the short run. Their price targets typically look at where they think a stock will go in the next 12 months or so. And based on their average price target of just under $494, Microsoft's stock could over the next year rise by 20% from where it trades right now.\nBut those price targets also cover a fairly wide range, and analysts' predictions do change. If the company's results in upcoming quarters prove to be underwhelming, that could lead to downgrades and price target cuts; if results exceed expectations, the opposite may occur. Thus, the consensus analyst price target for a stock is effectively a moving target.\nMicrosoft is a good stock to own in the long run. Given its diversified businesses from gaming to networking to cloud computing to business software, it's unlikely to run out of growth opportunities. But investors may still be pricing a bit too much optimism into the stock these days. Currently, Microsoft trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, which is higher than what it has averaged over the past five years.\nThere are, for example, rumblings that the company's AI assistant, Copilot, isn't exactly winning over customers. Just how much of a boost Microsoft is getting from AI should be made clearer by the company's upcoming quarterly numbers.\nIn the company's last reported quarter, which ended on July 30, revenue rose by 15% to $64.7 billion. That was a higher growth rate than the 8% it achieved a year earlier, but whether it's high enough to warrant an earnings multiple of 35 is the big question for investors today.\nWhat may create a further challenge to the stock in the near term is that Microsoft's ongoing heavy investments in AI are eating into its bottom line. Last quarter, for instance, the company's profits rose by just 10% year over year whereas a year earlier, they improved by 20%. So while its top-line growth accelerated, it wasn't the same story further down the income statement.\nIf Microsoft doesn't demonstrate both strong top- and bottom-line growth in its fiscal 2025 Q1 report (which comes out later this month), bearishness could increase, and analysts could downgrade the stock and cut their price targets in the weeks and months ahead.\nMicrosoft does look like it has hit a peak, at least in the near term. For the tech stock to rise a whole lot higher, investors would likely have to be willing to pay close to 40 times earnings for it, and I don't think its results and visible outlook are strong enough to justify that today.\nIf you're looking to hold onto Microsoft stock for five years or more, then by all means, buy it now. It's still a great long-term investment. But given that it trades at a fairly high premium these days, you shouldn't be surprised if there's some weakness ahead for the stock -- it could experience a correction in the near future.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 7 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other best gaming stocks to buy now.\nThe gaming industry does not only provide entertainment but also drives innovation in technology and creativity. The global gaming market was valued at $249.55 billion in 2022. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% during 2023-2030 to reach $665.77 billion by \u200bthe end of the forecast period. This expansion is driven by several key trends that are reshaping how games are developed and played.\nThe growing popularity of cloud gaming, the introduction of VR and AR technologies, and the rising interest in online gaming are some of the key trends driving market growth.\nThe rising interest in esports and online gaming tournaments is expected to boost consumer spending on games and contribute to market growth. Esports features teams and individual players competing in various video games. In July and August, the first-ever Esports World Cup took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, attracting over 1,500 players and offering a massive prize pool of $60 million. The event spanned eight weeks and included 23 competitions across 22 different video games, such as Call of Duty and Fortnite. This tournament is part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 initiative, aimed at diversifying the country\u2019s economy.\nAnother key trend is the integration of generative AI in gaming. This technology allows for the creation of dynamic storylines and realistic characters that can interact with players in a more lifelike manner. Experts believe this will enhance player engagement by personalizing experiences based on individual actions. The potential for AI to craft entire game worlds opens up new avenues for creativity in game design.\nAccording to Bernard Marr, a world-renowned futurist and author of \u201cGenerative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society\u201d, generative AI is revolutionizing video game development by providing tools that enable developers to create engaging content, realistic visuals, and immersive gameplay experiences. Marr believes that generative AI can help developers create vast, unique game environments through procedural generation, allowing for dynamic gameplay experiences that change with each session.\nMoreover, this technology can generate music and sound effects that adapt to in-game events, enriching the overall player experience. By automating tasks like quest creation and dialogue writing, generative AI can help developers enhance storytelling and design. Marr thinks that although generative AI won\u2019t replace human creativity, it can speed up game development and reduce costs, which is a big step forward for the gaming industry.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 7 best gaming stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest gaming companies. We also reviewed our own rankings, sifted through ETFs, and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of more than 20 gaming stocks, we focused on the top 7 stocks most favored by institutional investors.

The 7 best gaming stocks to buy now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational corporation that is widely recognized for its software products like the Windows operating system. The company has established itself as a key player in the global gaming market through its development of Xbox consoles and gaming services. Additionally, the company has made significant strides in the gaming industry, particularly with its acquisition of Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion in October 2023. With this acquisition, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) gains access to a host of popular franchises, including Call of Duty, Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch and Candy Crush, which have accelerated growth in the company\u2019s gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud platforms. This landmark deal not only enhances Microsoft\u2019s gaming portfolio but also positions it as one of the largest gaming companies in the world.\nThe company reported strong financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, showcasing significant growth across various segments. The company achieved revenue of $64.7 billion, marking a 15% increase compared to the same period last year. Notably, Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) gaming business saw an impressive 44% rise in revenue, driven largely by the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which contributed 48 points to this growth. Xbox content and services revenue surged by 61%, slightly exceeding expectations, with a net impact of 58 points from the Activision Blizzard deal.\nIn addition to revenue growth, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported an operating income of $27.9 billion and a net income of $22 billion for the quarter, reflecting increases of 15% and 10% year-over-year, respectively. In its gaming division, the company highlighted its expanding user base, which has now reached over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. Furthermore, the company previewed a record 30 new titles at its showcase this quarter, with popular games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 set to launch on Game Pass.\nDuring the Q4 2024 earnings call, management shared that the success of the Fallout TV show on Amazon Prime also contributed to increased engagement with the franchise on Game Pass, showcasing Microsoft\u2019s strategy to connect its gaming IPs with broader entertainment audiences. Fallout made its debut on Amazon Prime in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and it became the second most-watched title on the platform. As a result of the show\u2019s popularity, the hours played on Game Pass for Fallout games increased nearly five times compared to the previous quarter.\nOn September 16, 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share, which is an increase of 10% from the previous quarter. This dividend will be paid on December 12, 2024, to shareholders who are on record as of November 21, 2024. Additionally, the board approved a new share repurchase program allowing for up to $60 billion in buybacks, which does not have an expiration date and can be terminated at any time.\nThis combination of strategic growth and solid financial performance makes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) an appealing investment opportunity. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 database of over 900 hedge funds, 279 hedge funds held stakes in MSFT.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 1st among the best gaming stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

AI spending is rising across the tech supply chain, driven by the regular launch of generative AI projects in enterprise settings, according to Dan Ives. This signals that AI is becoming a \u201ctop priority\u201d for IT budgets heading into 2025, potentially unlocking new AI applications.\n\u201cWhile Nvidia and Microsoft are the core drivers of AI now, we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI party, including Oracle, ServiceNow, Palantir, Salesforce, Dell, IBM, Apple, AMD among others,\u201d Ives said. He believes tech stocks are poised to gain more than 10% by year-end, with an additional 20% rise expected in 2025, as the AI-driven tech bull market enters its next phase.\nHowever, some believe OpenAI was the only key edge Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) had in the AI race and it\u2019s quickly fading away.\nDA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company\u2019s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum.\nLuria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA\u2019s, according to Luria.\nFollowing a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft\u2019s dependence on NVIDIA.\nLuria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins.\nThe analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.\nThe concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1.\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cGenerative AI\u2019s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called \u2018inference\u2019).

This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 8 Most Profitable Tech Stocks Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other most profitable tech stocks right now.\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 10, Drew Pettit, Director of US Equity Strategy at Citi Research, shared his thoughts about the upcoming earnings season and its potential impact on the market. With the Dow and S&P 500 reaching new closing highs, Pettit raised the question of whether earnings would justify the current valuations. The technology sector has been on a tear, with many software names running up significantly in recent weeks. However, Pettit\u2019s warning suggests that investors should be cautious about getting too caught up in the hype. He noted that when there\u2019s a high bar, investors should be prepared for potential disappointments.\nPettit sounded a note of caution when it came to the tech sector, particularly software stocks. He noted that software has the highest bar within tech, not just in terms of growth expectations but also in terms of monetization. Many software companies are not seeing the expected growth in the next three years, which is already priced into their valuations. This mismatch between expectations and reality could create volatility in the sector.\nIn terms of specific guidance, Pettit expects companies to use the current uncertainty as an excuse to walk down expectations for Q4. This is a typical trend in US markets, where companies tend to set low expectations and then beat them. Pettit advises investors to focus on companies that can deliver on their promises.\nOverall, Pettit\u2019s comments suggest that investors should be cautious about the tech sector, particularly software stocks, and focus on companies that can deliver on their promises. He also emphasizes the importance of looking beyond the current quarter and focusing on long-term growth prospects.\nDan Flax, Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman is bullish on the technology sector, with a focus on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the next generation of workloads and are executing well on their product cycles. Flax expects concerns about cyclical headwinds to remain a factor but also sees select opportunities in the sector. He also noted that enterprise customers are looking to adjust to changes in the landscape cyclically and invest in transforming their organizations, which will drive technology spending in the second half of the decade.\nAs investors navigate the current market landscape, it is essential to approach the tech sector with a sense of caution. While the sector has been experiencing a significant upswing, investors should focus on companies that have a proven track record of delivering on their promises, rather than getting caught up in the hype surrounding certain stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 8 most profitable tech stocks right now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 40 largest technology companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 5-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Then we sorted the stocks in ascending order, according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds, as of Q2 of 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\u00a0\u00a0\nTTM Net Income: $88.13 Billion\u00a0\u00a0\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 17.57%\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant offering a diverse range of products and services, including its Windows operating system, Office productivity suite, Azure cloud platform, and Xbox gaming console. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also a leader in AI, enterprise software, and cloud computing, with its Azure being a key growth driver.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is accelerating its data center capacity expansion plans and is poised to overcome capacity constraints for AI training and inferencing, due to its strategic partnerships with Oracle and other hyper scalers, In March, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle announced to expand their partnership to meet the growing demand for Oracle Database Azure. The service will now be available in 15 regions globally, with 5 new regions added this year. Oracle Database Azure is now available in Germany and will allow customers to run Oracle database services on hardware in Azure data centers.\nThis collaboration helps Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offset some pressure while its investments in data centers, CPUs, and GPUs will support the growing demand for AI applications. In the financial year 2024, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) increased its capital investments by 58% to $44.5 billion. The company is well-positioned to capture the rapidly growing market for AI training and inferencing. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to construct 20 data centers globally, in addition to its existing 300+ data center footprint spanning 60+ regions. This expansion will enable the company to increase its capacity and provide more efficient and scalable services to its customers.\nMicrosoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominant position in the cloud and AI and significant investments in data center expansion make it an attractive investment opportunity. The company\u2019s earnings are projected to increase by 10.21% in the current year. With a consensus Buy rating from industry analysts, the stock has a target price of $495.97, which represents a 17.57% upside potential from its current level.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of most profitable tech stocks right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\nThe US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve\u2019s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts.\nJamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks\u00a0and\u00a010 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows.\nPowell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month\u2019s half-point cut, but there\u2019s market debate on the pace.\nSoaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop.\nNevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves.\nApart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions.\nAccording to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. \u201cThe bull market has survived the year\u2019s historically weakest quarter,\u201d said Hill in an interview with CNBC. \u201cIt is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.\u201d\nWhen considering which stocks to buy, it\u2019s beneficial to ask, \u201cWhich industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?\u201d Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million.\nSome of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves.\nAccording to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward.\nWith this economic perspective in mind, let\u2019s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279\nAmid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it\u2019s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure.\nAzure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further.\nDuring the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value.\nAI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings.\nAdditionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google.\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, landing at $2.95.\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings.\nAmid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\u201d\nOverall MSFT\u00a0ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Now.

        "Text": "OpenAI is considering transitioning from a nonprofit into a for-profit company, and its deep-pocketed benefactor, Microsoft (MSFT), has a lot to gain if the ChatGPT developer gets the green light to act more like a startup.\n\"Anything that frees up OpenAI to focus on profit is likely to benefit Microsoft's investment in the company,\" said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute in the Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell University.\nA reconfigured business structure would give Microsoft an opportunity to renegotiate its already generous profit cap, as well as discard a provision that denies Microsoft an interest in OpenAI-created general artificial intelligence (GAI), according to another observer.\n\u201c[OpenAI] is clearly saying that the nonprofit will no longer be in control, so presumably that means Microsoft and other investors will have more say about what OpenAI does,\" said Rose Chan Loui, founding executive director of the University of California Los Angeles's Lowell Milken Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits.\nBut there are potential snags for Microsoft as OpenAI attempts to shed its charitable cloak.\nOpenAI's huge valuation, labyrinth of for-profit subsidiaries, and potentially risky technology make a for-profit switch legally and publicly complicated \u2014 and could invite pushback from regulators.\nStill, OpenAI's investors see plenty of upside. On Wednesday, the company announced it raised some $6.6 billion in its latest funding round, valuing the Sam Altman-helped firm at $157 billion. However, that valuation is largely contingent on OpenAI becoming a for-profit entity.\nOpenAI is in the midst of a whirlwind of change.\nIt is experiencing an extended executive exodus including, most recently, the departure of chief technology officer Mira Murati. It also faces increased competition from rivals including Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic.\nThe reclassification to a for-profit structure would be yet another seismic shift for OpenAI, upending the way it was established nearly a decade ago.\nIt began in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity instead of pursuing profits.\n\u201cThe corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s certificate of incorporation stated in its organizing documents, along with a promise to keep its technology as open source for public benefit.\nThings evolved in 2019 when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his team created a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital \u2014 including billions from Microsoft.\nIt was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary, technically owned by a holding company owned by OpenAI employees and investors, remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power.\nThe inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to a dramatic boardroom clash in 2023, when Altman was ousted by the board and then brought back five days later.\nIn the aftermath, Microsoft took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI\u2019s board, only to relinquish that seat this year as both OpenAI and Microsoft came under more regulatory scrutiny.\nThe idea of upending the current structure has already attracted interest from US and European regulators and exacerbated an ideological divide between scientific and business leaders who warn that machine learning technologies like those developed by OpenAI should remain accessible to the public.\nThe technology, they argue, poses an existential threat to humankind and, therefore, should be operated in a way that's subject to public scrutiny.\nOpenAI and Microsoft are also part of an ongoing inquiry by the US Federal Trade Commission over concerns that AI market consolidation is \u201cdistorting innovation and undermining fair competition.\u201d\nAnd multiple calls have been made for California\u2019s attorney general to probe the legality of OpenAI\u2019s business structure. One came from Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI with Altman. He sued OpenAI, Altman and 21 named OpenAI subsidiaries.\nMusk said the defendants fraudulently promised that his $100 million in OpenAI investments would be used for public benefit.\nA transition by OpenAI to for-profit status could also attract the attention of the Internal Revenue Service, given that OpenAI was granted tax-exempt status as a charitable organization.\nOne unknown question is to what extent Microsoft will be able to directly extract profits from its investments.\nBy law, a nonprofit must use its assets only for its stated charitable purposes. And OpenAI's assets, which include all of OpenAI's subsidiaries, may not be sold for anything less than fair market value.\nThe question regulators will want to confirm is, \"Did they get fair market value for the asset at the time?\" said Gene Takagi, a principal at NEO Law Group.\nChan Loui added that regulators would require OpenAI to realistically value its assets, including residual interest. And she suspects that figure may be in excess of OpenAI's latest valuation.\n\u201cI think the greatest sensitivity probably is with how they remove the nonprofit's control,\u201d she said. \"And I think their best shot of avoiding conflict relating to restructuring is to compensate the nonprofit enough,\u201d Chan Loui said.\n\u201cI think that's the best way for them to get the public on their side, the states on their side, and the IRS on their side.\"\nWhat OpenAI is expected to do as part of its transition is register as a public benefit corporation.\nSuch entities are like traditional corporations but with more freedom to spend on civically minded initiatives, according to Rick Alexander, a veteran corporate structuring lawyer and founder of the Shareholder Commons,\n\"It's a permission structure,\" Alexander said.\nOther public benefit corporations include Elon Musk's xAI, Warby Parker (WRBY), Allbirds (BIRD), Lemonade (LMND), and Etsy (ETSY).\nAnd based on the success of Musk's xAI, OpenAI could benefit handsomely from the change. In May, xAI raised $6 billion.\n\"This type of transition can generate considerable investor interest quickly,\" Kreps said. \"This is such a capital-intensive industry, so anything OpenAI can do to attract investment will act as a positive feedback loop and accelerate its advantages.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks.\nOn September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.\nAccording to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.\nHe believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.\nAs the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.\nMiller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.\nMiller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.\nNow that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that develops productivity and business suite applications, cloud products, and personal computing products.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue worth $64.7 billion in FQ4 2024, up by 15% year-over-year. During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21%. Its productivity/business processes and intelligent cloud segment, on the other hand, logged revenue worth $20.3 billion and $28.5 billion respectively.\nThe company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. In July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies partnered to enhance and modernize Lumen\u2019s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy its suite of products in Microsoft Azure.\nThe company\u2019s partnerships do not end here. BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX recently made a $100 billion deal to enhance the functioning of data centers and AI. The company is also expanding its footprint by establishing engineering development centers in Abu Dhabi, UAE.\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) financial strength coupled with its strategic partnerships make it one of the best stocks to buy for the long term. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. As of June 30, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the most dominant shareholder in the company and has a position worth $15.6 billion, according to the Insider Monkey database.\nFred Alger Management's Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\"\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded\u00a0Bridgewater Associates\u00a0in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of \u201cMentor.\u201d\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm\u2019s management style and investment strategies.\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn\u2019t just an opinion, it\u2019s supported by concrete measures such as the nation\u2019s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they\u2019re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan\u2019s struggles in 1990, noting that China\u2019s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping\u2019s famous statement, \u201cIt\u2019s glorious to be rich,\u201d and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it\u2019s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund. We also added the total number of hedge fund investors per company, as of Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of Bridgewater Associates\u2019 stake in them.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nTotal Number of Shares Owned: 1,090,347\nTotal Value of Shares Owned: $487,330,592\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 5th in our list of the 10 best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. In Q2 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenues of $57.4 billion, which is a 13% increase from last year, with net income reaching $20.3 billion. A big part of this growth came from its cloud services, especially Azure, which saw a remarkable 30% increase in revenue to $25.5 billion, showcasing Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s strength in the cloud market.\nAnother key factor in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s success is its investment in artificial intelligence. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has integrated AI features into products like Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, making them more user-friendly and boosting productivity. Partnerships with organizations like OpenAI also enhance Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s position in the AI field.\nAdditionally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s gaming division is thriving, with Xbox revenue growing by 18% year-over-year, fueled by the popularity of Game Pass and strategic acquisitions of gaming studios. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also committed to sustainability and social responsibility, working to reduce carbon emissions and promote responsible use of AI.\nBridgewater\u2019s investment in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) includes 1,090,347 shares, valued at $487.3 million.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 5th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other widely held stocks.\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D\u2019Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

        "Text": "REDMOND, Wash., Oct. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. is unveiling several Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare innovations that connect care experiences, enhance team collaboration, empower healthcare workers, and unlock clinical and operational insights.\nThrough new healthcare AI models in Azure AI Studio, capabilities for healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, the healthcare agent service in Copilot Studio, and an AI-driven nursing workflow solution, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is supporting healthcare organizations on every step of their journey toward shaping a healthier future.\n\"We are at an inflection point where AI breakthroughs are fundamentally changing the way we work and live,\" said Joe Petro, corporate vice president, Healthcare and Life Sciences Solutions and Platforms at Microsoft. \"Across the broader healthcare and life sciences industry, these advancements are dramatically enhancing patient care and also rekindling the joy of practicing medicine for clinicians. Microsoft's AI-powered solutions are helping lead these efforts by streamlining workflows, improving data integration, and utilizing AI to deliver better outcomes for healthcare professionals, researchers and scientists, payors, providers, medtech developers, and ultimately the patients they all serve.\"\nExpanding the reach of AI beyond text: healthcare AI models in Azure AI Studio \nMicrosoft is announcing the launch of healthcare AI models,\u00a0a collection of cutting-edge multimodal medical imaging foundation models available in the Azure AI model catalog. Developed in collaboration with partners like Providence and Paige.ai,\u00a0these models enable healthcare organizations to integrate and analyze diverse data types \u2014 ranging from medical imaging to genomics and clinical records. By using these advanced models as a foundation, healthcare organizations can rapidly build, fine-tune and deploy AI solutions tailored to their specific needs, all while minimizing the extensive compute and data requirements typically associated with building multimodal models from scratch.\n\"The development of foundational AI models in pathology and medical imaging is expected to drive significant advancements in cancer research and diagnostics,\" said Carlo Bifulco, MD, chief medical officer of Providence Genomics and a co-author of the Prov-GigaPath study. \"These models can complement human expertise by providing insights beyond traditional visual interpretation and, as we move toward a more integrated, multimodal approach, will reshape the future of medicine.\"\nHarnessing the power of healthcare data with Microsoft Fabric\nHistorically, healthcare data has been difficult to access due to its unstructured nature and the limitations of existing data management systems. These challenges have limited organizations' ability to gain a comprehensive view of patient experiences and access valuable insights.\nWith the general availability of healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, healthcare organizations can overcome these barriers by reshaping how users access, manage and act on data with a single, unified AI-powered platform. Additionally, healthcare security application templates for Microsoft Purview, an innovative suite of features designed to help govern healthcare data, are available in public preview. We're also launching new capabilities in public preview within healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric including:\nConversational data integration: Send conversational data, such as patient conversations, from DAX Copilot to the Fabric platform. By sending DAX Copilot audio files, transcripts and draft clinical notes to Fabric, customers and partners can leverage various native tools in Azure and Fabric to analyze this data and/or combine it with other data to generate comprehensive insights.\nSocial determinants of health (SDOH) public dataset transformation: Ingest, persist, harmonize and consume SDOH national and international public datasets to enable healthcare organizations to identify risks and health-related social needs to help create equitable healthcare for all patients and communities.\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) claim and claim line feed (CCLF) data ingestion: Streamline the ingestion of claims data and harmonize with clinical, imaging and SDOH data to unlock actionable insights on patients and populations.\nCare management analytics: Leverage unified healthcare data and care management analytical templates to enhance patient care by identifying high-risk individuals, optimizing treatment plans and improving care coordination.\nData discovery and cohorting: Utilize an integrated workflow that allows healthcare organizations to create, manage, analyze and share patient cohorts.\nBuilding a safe and responsible healthcare agent\nHealthcare organizations face numerous challenges, including workforce shortages, rising costs and increasing patient care demands. Generative AI offers a potential solution to these challenges by automating administrative tasks, analyzing vast amounts of data for actionable insights and assisting healthcare professionals in decision-making.\nTo address this, Microsoft is announcing the public preview of healthcare agent service in Copilot Studio to build Copilot agents for appointment scheduling, clinical trial matching, patient triaging and more. Organizations can leverage the healthcare agent service to help create connected patient experiences, improve clinical workflows, and empower healthcare professionals while helping organizations meet industry expectations with Microsoft Copilot Studio. Early adopters, like Cleveland Clinic, which provided feedback to help optimize the solution for a healthcare setting, are already using these innovations to enhance patient experiences and improve operational efficiency.\nEnhancing nursing workflows with AI: nursing early outcomes\nWith the World Health Organization (WHO)1 predicting a shortage of 4.5 million nurses by 2030, the urgency to deliver technology to support the nursing profession is felt more than ever.\nLast month at Epic's UGM, we announced the next focus area for our collaboration in Epic Workshop. Today, we're sharing more about how we're actively collaborating with several leading healthcare organizations \u2014 including Advocate Health, Baptist Health of Northeast Florida, Duke Health, Intermountain Health Saint Joseph Hospital, Mercy, Northwestern Medicine, Stanford Health Care, and Tampa General Hospital \u2014 to build an AI solution using ambient technology that addresses nursing documentation by drafting flowsheets for review, allowing nurses to focus less on paperwork and more on their patients. This innovation expands on the company's long-standing strategic collaboration and joint development initiatives with Epic.\n\"AI is transforming nursing workflows by streamlining administrative tasks, allowing nurses to focus more on patient care,\" said Corey Miller, vice president of R&D at Epic. \"Together with Microsoft, we're using AI-powered ambient voice technology to populate patient assessments. Nurses using the tool are already sharing positive feedback on how it enhances personalized patient interactions.\"\n\"For nurses, the integration of AI-driven solutions into our workflows is a game changer,\" said Terry McDonnell, DNP, ANCP-BC, senior vice president and chief nurse executive, Duke University Health System, vice dean for Clinical Affairs, Duke University School of Nursing, Duke Health. \"It allows us to focus more on patient care rather than the administrative burden of documentation. By automating tedious tasks, Microsoft's ambient AI solution helps alleviate burnout and gives us more time to connect with our patients at the bedside, where we truly make a difference.\"\nEmpowering responsible AI practices across healthcare\nIn line with Microsoft's dedication to responsible AI, these new solutions adhere to the company's AI principles established in 2018 to help guide AI development and use. Microsoft remains committed to developing responsible AI by design, ensuring that these technologies positively impact both the healthcare ecosystem and broader society. In practice this means properly building, testing and monitoring systems to avoid undesirable behaviors, such as harmful content, bias, misuse and other unintended risks. Over the years, we have made significant investments in building out the necessary governance structure, policies, tools and processes to uphold these principles and build and deploy AI safely. At Microsoft, we are committed to sharing our learnings on this journey of upholding our Responsible AI principles with our customers. We use our own best practices and learnings to provide people and organizations with capabilities and tools to build AI applications that share the same high standards we strive for.\nFor more information on Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare and the new data and AI solutions and their impact, visit https://news.microsoft.com/hlth-2024, or visit Microsoft at booth #4004 at HLTH 2024.\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) creates platforms and tools powered by AI to deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.

This could value the company at $157 billion and cement its position as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\nMost investors are anticipating significant growth based on Altman's projections.\nThe funding has attracted returning venture capital investors Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest corporate backer, and new participation from AI heavyweight Nvidia\u00a0 (NVDA) .\nRelated: Steve Ballmer\u2019s net worth: The former Microsoft CEO\u2019s wealth in 2024\nOpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees that the company would be able to provide liquidity through a tender offer to buy back their shares following the funding. However, Reuters said, citing an anonymous source, that no details and timing have been decided.\nEarlier this year, the company allowed some employees to cash out their shares at a valuation of $86 billion.\nSeparately, OpenAI is reportedly lowering its dependency on Microsoft data centers and securing its own computing capacity. Friar says that Microsoft hasn't moved fast enough to supply the company with computing power, according to\u00a0The Information.\nIn return, Microsoft has aimed to lessen its reliance on OpenAI technology as they increasingly compete in selling AI products, the report said.\nThe Redmond, WA-based software giant has said that it plans to scale its spending on AI infrastructure to meet demand.\nCFO Amy Hood told analysts in July that \u201ccloud and AI-related spend represents nearly all of our total capital expenditures.\u201d\n\u201cWithin that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease data centers that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond,\u201d she said.\nRelated: Open AI is burning cash (and losing billions!)\nMicrosoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI's equity and provides computing resources to OpenAI through its Microsoft Azure cloud platform.\nOppenheimer downgraded Microsoft to perform from outperform and removed the firm's prior price target, citing concerns about OpenAI, according to The Fly.\nThe firm said that it believes consensus estimates for revenue and EPS are too high, calling OpenAI losses, which could be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion in 2025, its \"primary concern.\"\nEnterprises have been slow to adopt AI, and associated revenues are likely to disappoint, the firm said. That's not good news, at least for now, for Microsoft's bottom line.\nThe analyst added that, given that Microsoft is investing in \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d technology, Oppenheimer does not believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority.\nMore AI Stocks:\nApple stock slides as big iPhone 16 bet sputters\nAnalyst revisits Meta stock price target as Facebook parent ramps AI spend\nAnalyst reviews BlackRock stock rating after AI partnership with Microsoft\nAnalysts at Truist had a different take on Microsoft.\nThe firm, which kept its buy rating and $600 price target on the company, said that its deep dive into Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity business has confirmed that it has become an \"increasingly important\" area for the software giant.\nIn a research note, Truist tells investors that Microsoft's comprehensive security solutions are at a scale unmatched by competitors, which is likely to continue to be a \"growth vector\" over the long term.\nThe firm added that it remains \"bullish\" on Microsoft's potential to gain share as a consolidator in the security stack.\nMicrosoft is scheduled to report earnings in the next few weeks, and Wells Fargo, which has an overweight rating on the company and a $515 price target, said that the first-quarter results are somewhat tougher to handicap given the group's significant intra-quarter model reset.\nHowever, stronger-than-usual checks suggest that the underlying momentum for Azure is continuing, Wells Fargo said.\u00a0The firm said that it expects shares to benefit as more model clarity surfaces through FY25.\u00a0\nRelated: The 10 best investing books, according to our stock market pros\n\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this software maker have returned +2.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.08 per share, indicating a change of +3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.02 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Microsoft.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $64.42 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14%. The $277.36 billion and $314.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.2% and +13.5%, respectively.\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.84%. The EPS surprise was +1.72%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave \u2014 particularly in software and cloud services.\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss recently penned an investor note on the firm, maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $508. In the note, the analyst highlighted that investor patience appeared to be wearing thin with the tech giant regarding generative AI revenue, and questions were being asked around the return on investment in GPU spending and the environmental impacts of rising data center demand. Weiss underlined that as a perceived leader in the GenAI opportunity, investors looked to Microsoft for indications on the proper time horizons for seeing revenues start to flow.\nWeiss also discussed the return of investment on capex spending by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has risen 75% year-over-year to $55.7 billion, including capital leases. In fiscal 2025, that is expected to rise another 41% to reach $78.4 billion. Per the analyst, the spending question needed to be split into two, with one focused on the gross margin potential of GenAI related solutions, and the other on future model training costs.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 7 Best Software Infrastructure Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other best software infrastructure stocks to invest in now.\nTechnology drives nearly every facet of modern businesses, from individual tasks to overall operations, goods, and services. When integrated effectively, it enhances communication, boosts efficiency, and increases productivity. Both tech and non-tech companies rely on software infrastructure and solutions to keep their operations running smoothly. To that end, these companies invest heavily in servers, cloud migration, network monitoring and management, and communication tools\u2014all crucial components of software infrastructure.\nOne of the largest segments of the software infrastructure market is the cloud infrastructure industry. As businesses increasingly adopt cloud solutions to reduce costs and enhance efficiency, the demand for these services continues to grow. According to Synergy Research Group, global enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services reached $79 billion in the second quarter, marking a $14.1 billion or 22% increase from the same period in 2023. This represents the third consecutive quarter of substantial growth, with year-over-year increases exceeding 20%.\nSpecifically, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) emerged as a rapidly growing segment within the cloud infrastructure industry. Leading companies like Salesforce offer powerful functionalities through subscription-based models delivered over the web. This approach provides lower upfront costs, easy deployment, and ongoing updates, making advanced tools accessible to businesses of all sizes. In the SaaS model, providers grant customers access to application software and databases via the cloud. In 2023, the global SaaS market generated around $197 billion in revenue, representing nearly two-thirds of the total public cloud services market. Although SaaS revenue is projected to keep growing, its share of the overall cloud services market may decrease as cloud platform and infrastructure services expand.\nMeanwhile, IT leaders are turning to tech consolidation in response to global economic challenges like inflation, recession, and supply chain disruptions, as well as the need to reduce costs while modernizing IT infrastructure. Gartner predicted that global IT spending would reach around $5.26 trillion in 2024, an increase of 7.5% from 2023. However, rapid expansion in technology investments can lead to tech sprawl, with new tools often lacking compatibility. According to a report from Zylo, organizations have wasted an average of $18 million this year alone due to inefficient SaaS management.\nOn another front, cybersecurity emerged as a critical component of software infrastructure, with spending surging since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As cloud computing and remote work have become integral to business operations, organizations have encountered new security challenges. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of data breaches reached an all-time high in 2023, increasing by 71% from the previous record set in 2021 and up 78% from a slight dip in 2022.\u00a0Given these trends, it\u2019s no surprise that global cybersecurity spending was expected to surpass $200 billion in 2023\u2014an increase of approximately 12% from 2022.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we used a stock screener to identify tech companies that provide various forms of software infrastructure and/or are actively engaged in the industry. From that list, we selected the top 7 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds as of the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global technology leader known for its flagship software products, such as Windows and Office, and a significant player in cloud computing through its Microsoft Azure platform. Azure provides businesses with scalable IT solutions, facilitating seamless cloud adoption.\nThe Azure cloud platform remains a focal point for investors and analysts. Despite recent capacity constraints affecting growth, there is optimism for a rebound in the latter half of 2024. D.A. Davidson highlighted Microsoft\u2019s substantial investments in AI computing infrastructure, specifically in building GPU clusters to meet the increasing demand for AI applications. BMO Capital Markets also reiterated an Outperform rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a $500 price target, emphasizing the company\u2019s leadership in AI and its comprehensive portfolio. The firm anticipates Azure\u2019s growth to accelerate in the second half of FY25, following the September quarter\u2019s approximately 29% year-over-year growth guidance.\nIn fiscal Q4 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue of $64.7 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year, with net income rising 10% to $22 billion. This growth is largely driven by Microsoft Azure, which continues to benefit from AI integrations. With a 31% market share, Azure is well-positioned to capitalize on the strong demand for cloud solutions.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks as the top choice among the best software infrastructure stocks to buy, with 279 hedge funds holding positions in the company as of the June 2024 quarter.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of best software infrastructure stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe that certain AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's amazing how much things can change in just 20 years. Two decades ago, industrial and energy stalwarts General Electric and ExxonMobil were the most valuable companies when measured by market cap, worth $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Jump ahead to 2024, and technology concerns are leading the way.\nTopping the list are three of the world's most recognizable tech companies. Apple leads the pack at $3.4 trillion (as of this writing). Nvidia and Microsoft are trailing close behind, with market caps of $3.1 trillion and $3 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $1.9 trillion, it might seem premature to suggest that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has all the attributes necessary for membership in the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 42% over the past year and 109% over the past five years, and its rebound appears poised to continue.\nRecent improvements in the economy, the company's strong market position, and its measured adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) could be the drivers needed to fuel Amazon's membership in this elite fraternity.\nThe past several years have been rife with challenges, not the least of which was an economic downturn fueled by decades-high inflation. There's been a vast improvement in recent months, however, as consumer sentiment in September reached its highest point in five months and the Federal Reserve Bank began its long-awaited campaign of interest rate cuts.\nThe improving economic conditions are favorably impacting Amazon's results. In the second quarter, net sales of $148 billion climbed 10% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26 nearly doubled.\nHelping fuel the robust results were improvements from each of the company's major operating segments. Online sales in the U.S. increased 9%, while international sales climbed 7%. Perhaps most important was a reacceleration from Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- the company's cloud computing business -- which jumped 19%, its highest rate of growth since late 2022.\nEqually important is advertising -- the company's fastest-growing business -- which increased 20%, as Amazon is working to become a major player in the ad world.\nAmazon is the undisputed leader in the realm of e-commerce, which is an area it pioneered. The company accounted for 38% of U.S. digital retail sales last year, more than its next 15 largest rivals combined, according to data compiled by eMarketer. That dominance is expected to continue in 2024, with the company expected to nab 40% of online sales in the U.S. this year.\nThe company has long employed AI to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals. Amazon uses AI to make product recommendations to customers and predict and maintain adequate inventory levels at its distribution centers and warehouses. The company also uses AI-powered robots to stock shelves and gather merchandise for shipping, and deploys these advanced algorithms to determine the most efficient delivery routes.\nAmazon is also the leader in cloud computing, another business it pioneered. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top provider of cloud infrastructure services, with 33% of the market in the second quarter, with Microsoft Azure at No. 2 and Alphabet's Google Cloud at No. 3, with 20% and 10% of the market respectively, according to research firm Canalys. Amazon offers one of the largest repositories of AI models for its cloud customers, which has helped reaccelerate its cloud growth.\nLast but certainly not least is Amazon's digital advertising business. The company displays ads on its e-commerce website, Prime Video, Freevee, Amazon Music streaming services, its Twitch video game streaming platform, and more. The company uses AI to help ensure the advertising reaches its target market. The results are undeniable, as advertising has been Amazon's fastest-growing business for several years running.\nAmazon currently boasts a market cap of roughly $1.9 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 57% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $635 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would have to grow its revenue to roughly $998 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Amazon of 11% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. It's worth noting that Amazon has grown its annual revenue by nearly 400% over the past decade, so those expectations could well be conservative.\nFurthermore, Amazon is currently selling for roughly 3.2 times sales, a slight discount compared to its average multiple of more than 3.3 over the past five years. That's a pretty attractive price to pay for a company with so many ways to win.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Commenting about the Fed\u2019s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\u201cThe fact is, and I\u2019ve said this for a long time, I won\u2019t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.\u201d\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\u201cIf you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we\u2019re in now, in 2024.\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management\nBillionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Stake:\u00a0$12,187,315,624\nSome believe OpenAI was the only key edge Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0had in the AI race and it\u2019s quickly fading away.\nDA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company\u2019s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum.\nLuria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA\u2019s, according to Luria.\nFollowing a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft\u2019s dependence on NVIDIA.\nLuria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins.\nThe analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.\nThe concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024.

        "Author": "  Jeffrey Dastin ",
        "Text": "By Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft has given its consumer Copilot, an artificial intelligence assistant, a more amiable voice in its latest update, with the chatbot also capable of analyzing web pages for interested users as they browse.\nThe U.S. software maker now has \"an entire army\" of creative directors - among them psychologists, novelists and comedians - finessing the tone and style of Copilot to distinguish it, Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, told Reuters in an interview.\nIn one demonstration of the updated Copilot, a consumer asked what housewarming gift to buy at a grocery store for a friend who did not drink wine. After some back-and-forth, Copilot said aloud: \"Italian (olive) oils are the hot stuff right now. Tuscan's my go-to. Super peppery.\"\nThe feature rollout, starting Tuesday, is one of the first that Suleyman has overseen since Microsoft created his division in March to focus on consumer products and technology research.\nLong identified with business software, Microsoft has had a much harder road in the consumer realm. Its Bing search engine, for instance, is still dwarfed by Google.\nSuleyman is hoping for a bigger splash with Copilot, which launched last year in a crowded field of AI chatbots, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\nCopilot's newly fashioned voice capabilities make it seem much more of an active listener, giving verbal cues like \"cool\" and \"huh,\" Suleyman said.\nUnderlying the product are Microsoft AI, or \"MAI,\" models, plus a technology suite from partner OpenAI, Suleyman said.\nSuleyman added that consumers who spend $20 monthly for Copilot Pro can start testing a \"Think Deeper\" feature that reasons through choices, like whether to move to one city or another.\nHe said an additional test feature for paying subscribers, Copilot Vision, amounts to \"digital pointing\" - the ability for users to talk to AI about what they see in a Microsoft Edge browser. Consumers have to opt in, and the content they view will not be saved or used to train AI, Microsoft said.\nThese updates represent \"glimmers\" of AI that can be an \"ever-present confidant, in your corner,\" Suleyman said. It's a vision he articulated as CEO of Inflection AI, whose top talent Microsoft poached in a closely watched deal this year.\nSuleyman said that eventually, Copilot will learn context from consumers' Word documents, Windows desktops, even their gaming consoles if they grant permission.\nAsked what Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, thinks of the company's AI efforts, Suleyman said Gates was excited.\n\"He's always asking me about when Copilot can read and parse his emails. It's one of his favorite ones,\" Suleyman said. \"We're on the case.\"\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Microsoft shares, while none have the equivalent of a sell rating. The average analyst price target points to upside of more than 20% over the coming 12 months.\nSimilar ratios are seen across other megacap names. The percentage of buy ratings on Amazon, Nvidia Corp., and Meta Platforms Inc. make up nearly or more than 90% of analyst ratings, while in Alphabet\u2019s case, buy recommendations represent more than 80% of ratings.

Davidson have also turned more cautious on Microsoft.\n\u201cCompetition has largely caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation,\u201d analyst Gil Luria wrote in a note last week, citing cloud rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. A diminished lead in AI \u201cwill make it hard for MSFT to continue to outperform,\u201d Luria said, downgrading the stock to neutral from buy.\nMicrosoft trades at 31 times estimated earnings and almost 11 times projected revenue. While both multiples are down from recent peaks, they\u2019re well above their 10-year averages. The Nasdaq 100 trades at less than 26 times forward earnings and under 5 times sales.\nThe stock has also gathered some unfavorable comparisons to Oracle Corp., which has emerged as a popular alternative for software investors after its latest results showed robust AI tailwinds of its own. Oracle offers a lower multiple, trading at 26 times projected earnings, prompting several firms to upgrade the stock over the past month.\n\u201cOracle is sort of the new kid on the block, because it is more in the first innings of the growth curve,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cMore investors are rolling up their sleeves to look at it, whereas with Microsoft, they\u2019re sharpening their pencils as they focus on Azure growth and when it will see more of a return on its capex.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s July earnings, in contrast, revealed a slowdown in its Azure cloud-computing service. While it showed growth attributable to AI, that figure was lower than some had hoped, underlining concerns about when Microsoft will see a more pronounced return on investments in AI.\nEven after a weaker couple of months, Microsoft shares remain up 14% this year \u2014 and the recent underperformance follows a 57% gain in 2023. The vast majority on Wall Street remain bullish, with more than 94% of analysts rating Microsoft stock a buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe company\u2019s long-term prospects are also still viewed favorably. Revenue is expected to rise 14.5% in the 2025 fiscal year and accelerate for the next few years, reaching a 19% pace by 2028. Net earnings per share are also seen growing at a double-digit clip for the next several years.\nWith that backdrop, investors like Allspring\u2019s Javeri and Logan Capital\u2019s Ouimet remain positive on the shares in the long-term, despite short-term challenges.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never surprising to see a stock take a pause, especially after doing well and with the market rally broadening, but it\u2019s hard to find a company of this size and quality that\u2019s going to grow at this level for the next several years,\u201d Ouimet said. \u201cMicrosoft is so well positioned that the more it pulls back, the more attractive it looks.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nMeta Platforms Inc. shares just closed out the third quarter with a 13.5% advance, marking their seventh straight quarter of gains. That\u2019s the longest such streak for the Facebook parent since 2016. The stock is up more than 375% over the seven-quarter surge, with recent strength reflecting the company\u2019s potential to benefit from AI. The shares are up more than 60% this year.\nTop Tech Stories\nDirecTV and Dish have agreed to combine in a deal that will create the biggest pay-TV provider in the US with about 18 million subscribers. DirecTV will acquire Dish TV and Sling TV from EchoStar Corp. for a nominal consideration of $1 plus the assumption of about $9.75 billion of debt, according to a statement that confirmed previous Bloomberg News reporting.\nApple Inc. must face class claims from people who purchased certain iPhones and iPads in California with software that took up a significant chunk of storage preinstalled, but the company defeated buyers\u2019 bids for two nationwide classes Monday.\nDell Technologies Inc. founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell on Thursday sold 10 million shares of his namesake company\u2019s stock worth $1.22 billion, his second significant sale in September, according to filings.\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s $350 million settlement of securities claims that it didn\u2019t disclose a Google social network security flaw is reasonable, as is an investor request for 19% of the total in legal fees, a federal court said Monday.\nRavi Ahuja will replace Tony Vinciquerra as the chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Hollywood arm of Tokyo-based Sony Group Corp., in January.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nNo major earnings expected\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nInvestors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nMilitary Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US\nThe Presidential Election Isn\u2019t Stopping International Students From Coming to America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) look very promising so lets take a look.\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Microsoft is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.28 = US$109b \u00f7 (US$512b - US$125b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThus, Microsoft has an ROCE of 28%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.4% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nIn the above chart we have measured Microsoft's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Microsoft .\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Microsoft. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 28%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 78%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Microsoft thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\nIn summary, it's great to see that Microsoft can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 232% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\nLike most companies, Microsoft does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A hacking group tied to Russian intelligence tried to worm its way into the systems of dozens of Western think tanks, journalists and former military and intelligence officials, Microsoft (MSFT) and U.S. authorities said Thursday.\nThe group, known as Star Blizzard to cyberespionage experts, targeted its victims with emails that appeared to come from a trusted source \u2014 a tactic known as spear phishing. In fact, the emails sought access to the victims' internal systems, as a way to steal information and disrupt their activities.\nStar Blizzard's actions were persistent and sophisticated, according to Microsoft, and the group often did detailed research on its targets before launching an attack. Star Blizzard also went after civil society groups, U.S. companies, American military contractors and the Department of Energy, which oversees many nuclear programs, the company said.\nOn Thursday, a U.S. court unsealed documents authorizing Microsoft and the Department of Justice to seize more than 100 website domain names associated with Star Blizzard. That action came after a lawsuit was filed against the network by Microsoft and the NGO-Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit tech organization that investigated Star Blizzard.\nAuthorities haven't gone into details about Star Blizzard's effectiveness but said they expect Russia to keep deploying hacking and cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies.\n\u201cThe Russian government ran this scheme to steal Americans\u2019 sensitive information, using seemingly legitimate email accounts to trick victims into revealing account credentials,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in announcing the U.S. actions against Star Blizzard. \"With the continued support of our private sector partners, we will be relentless in exposing Russian actors and cybercriminals and depriving them of the tools of their illicit trade.\u201d\nStar Blizzard has been linked to Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB. Last year, British authorities accused the group of mounting a yearslong cyberespionage campaign against U.K. lawmakers. Microsoft said it has been tracking the group's activities since 2017.\nMicrosoft said it observed Star Blizzard attempt dozens of hacking efforts targeting 30 different groups since January 2023. The tech giant's cybersecurity experts say Star Blizzard has proven to be especially elusive.\n\u201cStar Blizzard\u2019s ability to adapt and obfuscate its identity presents a continuing challenge for cybersecurity professionals,\u201d the company wrote in a report on its findings.\nU.S. authorities charged two Russian men last year in connection with Star Blizzard's past actions. Both are believed to be in Russia.\nAlong with American targets, Star Blizzard went after people and groups throughout Europe and in other NATO countries. Many had supported Ukraine following Russia's invasion.\nA message left with the Russian Embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Thursday.\n"

        "Text": "CALGARY, AB, Oct. 7, 2024 /CNW/ - Enbridge Inc. (TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB), in collaboration with Microsoft, is harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to drive significant advancements in safety, emissions reduction, and asset optimization across its operations.\nBuilding on a strong digital foundation, the company began implementing AI over five years ago and is now leveraging it to support operational and environmental excellence.\n\"Our long-term collaboration with Microsoft has enabled us to apply cutting edge technology, which is helping to solve critical business problems and deliver powerful outcomes,\" said Bhushan Ivaturi, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Enbridge. \"The investments we're making today will play a critical role in enabling technological solutions to the biggest challenges in the evolution of our energy systems as we transition to a lower-carbon future.\"\nEnbridge embarked on a digital transformation in 2020 to drive productivity and efficiency and empower employees with the tools and capabilities they need for personal productivity. At the core of this strategy was a secure and modern technology foundation enabled by Microsoft.\nThis led to an ambitious cloud migration and modernization program, with over 80 percent of workloads moved to Microsoft Azure cloud platform within two years. This initiative not only enhanced computing, network, and storage capabilities but also bolstered cybersecurity measures and reduced data centre emissions through server decommissioning and a smaller physical facility footprint. Today, that strong digital foundation has positioned Enbridge as a leader in AI. Earlier this year, Enbridge rolled out Microsoft 365 Copilot to nearly one third of all employees, while the entire workforce has access to Bing Enterprise and ChatENB, an internal chat bot using Azure OpenAI Service.\n\"The Enbridge leadership team drove a cloud-first strategy, a big bet that opened the door to broader opportunity that positions Enbridge today to take full advantage of AI,\" said Tom Kubik, Enterprise Commercial Multi-Industry Lead at Microsoft Canada. \"We are proud of the work we've done together and are working towards our common goals of supporting a more connected and collaborative workforce and increasing data and analytics capabilities.\"\nAI-Powered Initiatives\nEnbridge is leveraging AI across its operations to optimize assets, increase efficiencies, enhance safety, and contribute to its broader sustainability goals. Powered by Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, key examples include:\nEnergy Optimizer\nThe Energy Optimizer tool leverages AI to provide real-time operational insights, enabling Control Center operators to make decisions about how to move the energy Enbridge transports in the most efficient way possible. By managing the amount of power required, Enbridge can achieve cost savings and GHG reductions, while ensuring the safe, reliable and efficient operations of its liquid pipelines.\nRight of Way Monitoring\nEnbridge utilizes aerial surveillance to patrol its pipelines, detecting potentially damaging activities, conditions, or loss of containment. With AI, the company can now monitor the right of way more efficiently, reviewing data and detecting issues quicker and more accurately. This AI-driven approach has improved threat detection and response, significantly reducing the risk of third-party damage.\nIntegrity Engine\nEnbridge employs intelligent automation for pipeline integrity, using AI to identify potential maintenance needs. Through workflow automation, data controls, advanced analysis, and machine learning models, the company gains new insights for rapid and effective asset maintenance, enhancing safety and efficiency while reducing process complexity and maintaining the health of our assets.\n\"Looking forward, we see ongoing opportunities and benefits of AI, in terms of data analytics, asset and process optimization, security and cost and emissions savings,\" said Ivaturi. \"At Enbridge, we are enabling the accessibility, sustainability, and security of energy through applied technology and innovation, and our collaboration with Microsoft will continue to play a pivotal role in that.\"\nAbout Enbridge Inc.\u00a0\nAt Enbridge, we safely connect millions of people to the energy they rely on every day, fueling quality of life through our North American natural gas, oil and renewable power networks and our growing European offshore wind portfolio. We're investing in modern energy delivery infrastructure to sustain access to secure, affordable energy and building on more than a century of operating conventional energy infrastructure and two decades of experience in renewable power to advance new technologies including hydrogen, renewable natural gas and carbon capture and storage.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 October 11, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Archrock AROC and Targa Resources TRGP.\nWith the explosion of AI technology and the tremendous energy it demands, business leaders have been frantically searching for new ways to power this technological super-trend. Just for context, if the rate of adoption for AI continues at its current pace, data center energy demand will grow from 3-4% of total power demand to 11-12% by 2030, according to McKinsey. That is a massive increase and if the US is going to keep up, we need to find a solution fast.\nIn a surprising turn of sentiment, business leaders and policymakers have turned to nuclear energy as a potential solution. Microsoft just recently struck a deal to restart operations at Three-Mile Island, a once shuttered nuclear power plant.\nWhile I am very excited by the resurgence of favorable opinion towards nuclear energy and the attempts to add it back to the energy grid, there is still one major problem. To power the expansion of AI, new power needs to be added to the energy grid immediately, and while nuclear energy has incredible potential, it will be years before the requisite infrastructure gets online to truly expand nuclear capacity. The reality is, there are very few existing nuclear power plants and erecting them takes years.\nFortunately, there is a solution. One energy source that is readily available today, with a well-established infrastructure already in place, is natural gas. I think it is more than likely that natural gas will end up being the primary solution for powering AI, as it is already the leading source of electricity, producing 43% of the country\u2019s electricity.\nAt this moment in time, we are ahead of the market in realizing just how important natural gas will be for Artificial Intelligence, and it may soon become a major investment theme. Archrock \u00a0and Targa Resources are two stocks with top ranks and strong price momentum that should benefit tremendously from this trend.\nArchrock is a natural gas compression services company based in the U.S. It focuses on providing natural gas compression equipment, maintenance, and operational support. This service is crucial for the transportation of natural gas through pipelines, as compression is necessary to maintain adequate pressure for efficient transmission over long distances.\nArchrock's customers include natural gas producers, processors, and transportation companies. The company's core market benefits from the growing demand for natural gas as a cleaner energy source, especially as the shift toward providing for the AI revolution progresses. The company\u2019s significant presence in the U.S. natural gas industry positions it to capitalize on the ongoing expansion of infrastructure and increasing reliance on natural gas.\nIn addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, Archrock also boasts a compelling technical chart setup. The stock has gone on a strong run since the start of 2023 but has been consolidating since the end of Q1 this year. Now, the price action is bumping up against the upper level of resistance and with the new catalyst of AI, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a breakout very soon.\nArchrock is also currently trading at a reasonable valuation. At 19.8x forward earnings, it is below the market average and its 10-year median of 23.1x. Archrock also pays a tidy 3.1% dividend and has raised the payout by an average of 4.4% annually over the last three years.\nTarga Resources is a leading provider of midstream services in the North American energy sector. The company primarily focuses on the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Targa operates an extensive network of infrastructure, including pipelines, storage facilities, and gas processing plants, which support the efficient movement of natural gas and NGLs from production points to key markets.\nTarga Resources is known for its strategic position in key energy-producing regions, such as the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, enabling it to benefit from rising U.S. energy production. The company plays a crucial role in ensuring the supply chain for natural gas and NGLs remain efficient, supporting the broader energy market. Targa\u2019s financial stability, ongoing infrastructure development, and integrated services make it a prominent player in the energy midstream industry.\nTarga Resources enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating led by analysts unanimously upgrading earnings estimates. FY24 earnings estimates have increased by 4.1% in the last two months and are expected to grow 61.2% year-over-year (YoY), while FY25 estimates have jumped by 5.4% and are projected to climb 25.2% YoY.\nTRGP is currently trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 27.7x, which is just above the market average, but below its 10-year median of 28.3x. Targa Resources also has a dividend yield of 1.8% and has raised the payment by an average of 31% annually over the last five years.\nBoth Archrock and Targa Resources present compelling opportunities for investors seeking exposure to the natural gas industry, particularly as this energy source gains renewed importance in the age of AI and increased energy demand.\nBoth stocks are well-positioned to benefit from the next commodity megatrend driven by the AI revolution's energy demands. Archrock provides a more value-oriented play with steady income, while Targa Resources offers a growth narrative backed by its pivotal role in the midstream natural gas sector. Investors looking to ride the wave of increased natural gas usage may find both stocks appealing, depending on their investment style and objectives.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  DAVID KLEPPER ",
        "Text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A hacking group tied to Russian intelligence tried to worm its way into the systems of dozens of Western think tanks, journalists and former military and intelligence officials, Microsoft (MSFT) and U.S. authorities said Thursday.\nThe group, known as Star Blizzard to cyberespionage experts, targeted its victims with emails that appeared to come from a trusted source \u2014 a tactic known as spear phishing. In fact, the emails sought access to the victims' internal systems, as a way to steal information and disrupt their activities.\nStar Blizzard's actions were persistent and sophisticated, according to Microsoft, and the group often did detailed research on its targets before launching an attack. Star Blizzard also went after civil society groups, U.S. companies, American military contractors and the Department of Energy, which oversees many nuclear programs, the company said.\nOn Thursday, a U.S. court unsealed documents authorizing Microsoft and the Department of Justice to seize more than 100 website domain names associated with Star Blizzard. That action came after a lawsuit was filed against the network by Microsoft and the NGO-Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit tech organization that investigated Star Blizzard.\nAuthorities haven't gone into details about Star Blizzard's effectiveness but said they expect Russia to keep deploying hacking and cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies.\n\u201cThe Russian government ran this scheme to steal Americans\u2019 sensitive information, using seemingly legitimate email accounts to trick victims into revealing account credentials,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in announcing the U.S. actions against Star Blizzard. \"With the continued support of our private sector partners, we will be relentless in exposing Russian actors and cybercriminals and depriving them of the tools of their illicit trade.\u201d\nStar Blizzard has been linked to Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB. Last year, British authorities accused the group of mounting a yearslong cyberespionage campaign against U.K. lawmakers. Microsoft said it has been tracking the group's activities since 2017.\nMicrosoft said it observed Star Blizzard attempt dozens of hacking efforts targeting 30 different groups since January 2023. The tech giant's cybersecurity experts say Star Blizzard has proven to be especially elusive.\n\u201cStar Blizzard\u2019s ability to adapt and obfuscate its identity presents a continuing challenge for cybersecurity professionals,\u201d the company wrote in a report on its findings.\nU.S. authorities charged two Russian men last year in connection with Star Blizzard's past actions. Both are believed to be in Russia.\nAlong with American targets, Star Blizzard went after people and groups throughout Europe and in other NATO countries. Many had supported Ukraine following Russia's invasion.\nA message left with the Russian Embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Thursday.\n"

However, despite their differences, these companies need each other to thrive in today's world. \nThat's evident in a recent collaboration agreement between these companies, with Microsoft helping Enbridge harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its operations. Meanwhile, Enbridge supplies the fuel data centers -- like those Microsoft operates -- need to power AI applications.\nEnbridge recently unveiled a collaboration with Microsoft and will use AI to drive significant advancements in safety, emissions reduction, and asset optimization across its pipeline and utility platforms. It's an extension of the digital-transformation initiatives the company began in 2020 to drive productivity and efficiency gains. \nMicrosoft's technology has been the foundation of that strategy. It has taken a cloud-first approach by migrating its workloads to Microsoft Azure. Enbridge also uses the tech titan's Microsoft 365 Copilot, Bing Enterprise, and ChatENB, an internal chatbot that uses the Azure OpenAI service. \nThe new collaboration will enable Enbridge to leverage AI powered by Microsoft Azure machine learning across its operations. Some of its AI-powered initiatives include:\nEnergy optimizer: Enbridge will use AI to provide real-time operational insights about how to transport energy in the most efficient way possible. That will save the company money and reduce emissions.\nRight-of-way monitoring: The company will use AI to monitor the right of way more efficiently. This approach should help improve threat detection and response, helping reduce the risk of damage. \nIntegrity engine: The energy infrastructure company will use AI to identify potential maintenance needs. That will enhance safety, reduce complexity, and maintain the health of its assets. \nCost savings and optimizations are an important earnings growth driver for Enbridge. The company aims to achieve 200 million Canadian dollars to CA$300 million ($146.6 million-$219.9 million) of recurring earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) savings per year. That would add 1% to 2% to its annual EBITDA tally each year and is a meaningful driver for a company targeting around 5% annual EBITDA growth. \nCost savings are only one earnings-growth driver for Enbridge. The company is working to capitalize on the expected surge in power demand from AI data centers to expand its operations. Those facilities use a significant amount of electricity, which could drive accelerated growth in power demand over the coming years. \nFor example, the company recently bought a trio of natural gas utilities from Dominion. The gas utility in Utah is already starting to see incremental demand from data centers. \nEnbridge noted on its second-quarter earnings conference call, \"In this quarter, we added 50 megawatts (MW) under contract and have numerous additional inquiries to provide natural gas brought to an additional 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.\" That's only one example.\n The company also noted, \"Throughout our utility footprint, we are engaged in additional early stage discussions with data centers that we expect to translate into future growth.\" In addition to driving accelerated growth in its utilities, Enbridge is seeking incremental expansion opportunities in its gas transmission business and renewable-power operations. \nMicrosoft has been on a clean power buying spree this year. The company inked a massive 10.5-GW deal with Brookfield Renewable to help supply renewable power to its operations in the U.S. and Europe. That was the largest-ever corporate power purchase agreement. Microsoft followed that up with a more than 800-MW deal with Constellation Energy to restart a previously shut down nuclear power plant.\nEnbridge is also capitalizing on the growing demand for renewable energy from telecom and tech companies. Amazon is buying 100% of the power of its Fox Squirrel Solar project in Ohio, while AT&T is the purchaser of all the electricity produced by its Orange Grove Solar project in Texas. \nExpansion projects like these will help power additional earnings growth for Enbridge. That will enable the company to continue growing its cash flow and dividend. \nThe company has done a magnificent job paying dividends over the years. It has paid dividends for nearly 70 years and increased its payout for the last 29 years in a row. \nEnbridge is working with Microsoft to leverage the power of AI to improve safety, cut emissions, and reduce costs. That will help grow its earnings in the coming years. In addition, the company is capitalizing on the surging need for lower carbon energy by technology companies to power their AI data centers. \nThose growth drivers should increase the company's earnings by around 5% annually, which should allow Enbridge to continue growing its 6.5%-yielding dividend. That combination of growth and income could give Enbridge the power to produce a more than 10% average annual total return in the future. That makes it a lower-risk way to earn an attractive return in the AI age. \nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT).\nMicrosoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.18, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.18 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 34 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.2% and 7.7% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Microsoft, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0% over the past month to $13.04.\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Microsoft. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microsoft with a grain of salt.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nOppenheimer analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from Outperform to Perform on Tuesday, citing concerns about elevated consensus expectations for both revenue and earnings.\nA key issue raised by the firm\u2019s analysts is potential losses stemming from Microsoft's AI partner, OpenAI, which is expected to post a loss of around $5 billion this year. With Microsoft holding a 49% stake, the company could face significant financial impact as a result.\nThe downgrade also highlighted slower-than-expected enterprise adoption of AI technologies, which could lead to lower-than-anticipated revenue from AI-related services.\nIn addition, Oppenheimer pointed to rising capital expenditures (CapEx), particularly in high-performance computing, such as GPUs and data centers. The firm estimates that Microsoft's CapEx will hit $63 billion by 2025, a 14% year-over-year increase and double what it spent in 2023. Depreciation is also expected to rise by 28%, reaching $29 billion.\nThe analysts mentioned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s 50 basis point interest rate cut in September, will likely have a modest effect on Microsoft\u2019s net interest income from its $76 billion cash reserve.\nOppenheimer also expressed concerns over Microsoft\u2019s gross and EBITDA margins, which are expected to decline due to rising depreciation and operational costs linked to AI investments.\n\u201cThis will translate into 3% EPS growth in 1Q25 and we expect weakish guidance for 2025. We also think the Street estimates for EPS growth are ~200bps too high in FY26 and FY27,\u201d analysts said in a note.\nFurther risks include potential bottlenecks in data center capacity to meet anticipated GPU shipments and growing competition in the AI space, with other companies narrowing the gap on Microsoft.\nMicrosoft\u2019s stock currently trades in the middle of its five-year price-to-earnings range of 25x-35x, though Oppenheimer suggests it could drift toward the lower end of that spectrum.\nGoldman Sachs raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 on Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.\nFollowing a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed stronger confidence in Nvidia's competitive positioning, particularly as inference workloads become more complex.\n\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" the bank noted.\nGoldman Sachs highlighted several factors underpinning Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage, including its large installed base, innovation at both the chip and data center levels, and its expanding software offerings.\nThe report specifically mentioned domain-specific libraries like Nvidia Parabricks, used for genomics analysis, and Nvidia AI Aerial, which supports cloud-native 5G networks.\nThe firm also raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates for FY2026/27 by 7% and 8%, respectively. This adjustment reflects higher cloud capex, strong AI server orders, and an improved outlook for chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) at TSMC.\nWells Fargo cut Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rating to Equal Weight from Overweight earlier in the week, pointing out several challenges that could halt the company\u2019s positive earnings revision momentum.\nThe bank also reduced its price target for Amazon to $183 from $225.\nAlthough Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains a strong performer, Wells Fargo stated it is \"not enough\" to drive upward estimate revisions in the near term.\nKey concerns include Amazon's investments in Project Kuiper, pressure from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and slowing growth from its advertising business.\nThe firm also warned that \"margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well\" and suggested that positive revisions may not return until Amazon issues guidance in July 2025.\n\u201cWhile the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q OI, we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well. As such, we move to Equal Weight until visibility into margin expansion resumes,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s team wrote.\nMoreover, Wells Fargo cut its operating income (OI) estimates for Amazon by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, attributing the reductions to slower monetization of its merchant services and advertising businesses.\n\"Amazon remains a margin expansion story,\" according to the bank, but it noted that the rate of this expansion will likely be slower than what the market currently anticipates.\nThe note also highlighted rising competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has priced its fulfillment services 15% lower than Amazon's FBA, adding pressure to Amazon\u2019s market share.\nMorgan Stanley analysts voiced disappointment following Tesla's much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event this week, citing a lack of key information about Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, ride-sharing economics, and a clear go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles.\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dropped nearly 9% Friday, as several analysts pointed to the absence of detailed updates during the event.\nTesla did reveal its upcoming \"Cybercab,\" but Morgan Stanley remarked that the presentation lacked meaningful new insights. \"We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation,\" analysts said in a note.\nAhead of the event, Morgan Stanley had anticipated significant updates on Tesla\u2019s FSD technology, such as measurable improvements in miles driven without disengagements, but these specifics were not provided.\nThe Wall Street firm also expected details on the strategy behind the company's supervised and unsupervised ride-sharing services, including economic analysis and estimates for the total addressable market (TAM).\n\"We had expected at least some incremental information around the 'rate of change' of the FSD system,\" it explained.\nFurthermore, the event did not provide any meaningful discussion on Tesla\u2019s collaboration with xAI or updates on Tesla\u2019s \"Master Plan 4,\" leaving Morgan Stanley analysts to conclude that the event failed to significantly move forward Tesla\u2019s narrative as an AI-focused company.\nCapital Economics warned in a Friday note that escalating trade disputes between the US and China, or a sharp rise in tensions between China and Taiwan, represent significant geopolitical risks that could \u201cprick the AI bubble.\u201d\nWhile tech stocks have seen strong performance this year, the firm cautioned that the rally could stall as geopolitical risks intensify, especially with the US presidential election approaching.\nA central concern is Taiwan\u2019s critical role in the AI supply chain. Taiwanese companies control around 90% of the market for advanced chips and AI servers, key drivers of the AI capital expenditure boom among major tech firms.\nAccording to Capital Economics, any disruption in this supply chain due to geopolitical conflict could have severe consequences.\n\"China could restrict the flow of highly advanced semiconductor chips and AI servers from Taiwan to the US, thereby breaking the 'AI supply chain,'\" the firm emphasized in a note.\nOn the US-China trade front, the report points to potential risks of heightened tensions after the 2024 US presidential election.\nIf Donald Trump returns to office, strategists anticipate \"a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods\" and a broader shift away from free trade, which would raise costs for tech companies. Even under a Harris administration, which is expected to maintain current export controls, there is still considerable risk to the tech sector.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints\nMoon race, private competition in focus as space powers gather in Milan\nBASF downgraded to 'neutral' by UBS amid earnings growth concerns for 2025\n"

        "Author": "  Charlene Rhinehart, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Most investors are drooling over Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) jaw-dropping growth story. And let's be honest: With the company's $3 trillion market cap, it's hard not to. But a lesser-known perk to keep an eye on is its consistent dividend rewards to shareholders.\nMicrosoft declared its first dividend for shareholders in 2003 and has been treating shareholders to consistent dividend increases for nearly two decades. This September, the company stuck to its usual playbook by announcing another dividend hike. Although the dividend yield sits below 1%, which might not excite income-focused investors, this bump could lead to a bigger payout in 2025.\nLet's take a quick look back at 2024. Microsoft paid a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share in March, June, and September. Then, on Sept. 16, the tech giant announced it would raise its quarterly dividend to $0.83 per share, which is slated to hit investors' accounts in December. This increase brings the total annual dividend payout to $3.08 per share for 2024.\nLet's do the math. With 7.43 billion shares outstanding (according to Microsoft's latest financial reports), the total dividend payout for 2024 comes to a whopping $22.88 billion. Not too shabby.\nAssuming Microsoft continues paying $0.83 per share each quarter in 2025, the annual dividend payout would increase to $3.32 per share. If the number of shares remains the same, Microsoft's total dividend payout would rise to approximately $24.67 billion.\nMicrosoft raised its dividend by over 10% this September, and it wouldn't be surprising if the tech giant repeated this in 2025. Another increase could beef up the annual dividend for shareholders. Also, Microsoft recently announced a $60 billion stock-buyback program, which could reduce the number of outstanding shares if buybacks begin in 2025.\nThere are a few moving pieces to keep an eye on. But if Microsoft continues its past dividend trends, you could be handsomely rewarded.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $728,325!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Salesforce is taking on archrival Microsoft in the competitive new space of copilots, which are AI assistants designed to help developers improve the customer experience (CX) across business interactions such as sales and support.\nIn an effort to improve its brand-awareness in a highly competitive space, Salesforce is going after leading agent/copilot competitors, including Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT, and IBM watsonx via Salesforce Agentforce\u2019s autonomous decision-making abilities in response to enterprises\u2019 demand for data/AI abstraction.\nFollowing last month\u2019s Salesforce Dreamforce mega conference held in San Francisco, the most provocative takeaway is the newly available autonomous agents for providing more accessible and advanced GenAI capabilities to the app development process.\nSalesforce executives, starting with CEO Mark Benioff, made it abundantly clear they were going after Microsoft Copilot with the newly branded and advanced AI assistant, previously called Einstein AI.\nThis is an ambitious plan considering that Microsoft\u2019s vast popularity is due to Copilot\u2019s deep integration with Microsoft products, including Teams, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word. Microsoft also has an edge with the broader developer community, via GitHub Copilot. Enterprise DevOps teams predominantly use Microsoft Copilot based on their prevalent use of the Azure portfolio of developer tools and platforms to support app modernisation initiatives.\n\u201cSalesforce has an uphill battle as it seeks to gain mindshare against those heavyweights. Its best approach is to emphasise the autonomous qualities of its product, such as supporting more automation through AI and analytics to go above and beyond traditional stock chatbot answers in order to improve and personalise the customer experience,\u201d said Charlotte Dunlap, Research Director at GlobalData.\n\u201cThis is critical considering how many enterprises continue to fork over hefty premiums for professional services associated with ongoing unfamiliarity of immature GenAI technology. DevOps teams ill-equipped to formulate cohesive strategies complain of an inability to locate knowledgeable third-party expertise with an understanding of how GenAI fits into their current IT systems, particularly as they grapple with security and governance concerns,\u201d she added. \u201cThe more automation/autonomy Salesforce builds into Agentforce as part of its traditional business apps and platforms offerings, the better its AI tools can be used intuitively, spurring greater adoption. Once again, this is where Salesforce reaps the benefits of leading integration capabilities provided by MuleSoft, not to mention its merits as the industry\u2019s pioneer in low-code/intuitive app platforms.\u201d\nThis is also why Salesforce talks up the idea of higher levels of abstraction around its data, such as Data Cloud, coupled with low-level UI.\nNow, Salesforce is talking about abstracting AI and models, such as its Atlas Reasoning Engine, or the learning analytics engine which can go beyond traditional AI assistants to take broader actions involving customer requirements \u2013 actions that previously required human interaction. The agent support takes place across sales, service, and marketing functions.\nHow well Salesforce executes on its latest GenAI strategy will become more evident in coming months. But the company is keenly aware of what is riding on its ability to leverage past successes of effectively simplifying the developer experience.\nEnterprises are demanding improved support from technology providers not only with AI innovations, but through thought leadership, which can help them make their case for going after budget and executive support. Enterprises tell GlobalData that they continue to struggle to gain such support.\n\"Salesforce takes on GenAI copilot rival Microsoft \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms or Microsoft: Oppenheimer Chooses the Superior AI Stock to Buy",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The tech sector has been powering market gains over the past year, and AI stocks have been at the forefront of tech. AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors.\nBut not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street\u2019s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities.\nCovering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology.\nSo, let\u2019s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank\u2019s choice as the superior AI stock to buy.\nMeta Platforms\nWe\u2019ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world\u2019s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience \u2013 at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world\u2019s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted.\nMeta\u2019s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company\u2019s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta\u2019s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms \u2013 as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion \u2013 a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations.\nSolid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world \u2013 and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.\nBut the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta\u2019s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements.\nIn addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company\u2019s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company\u2019s toolbox \u2013 and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path.\nFor Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. \u201cMETA AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,\u201d the 5-star analyst explained. \u201cWe believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META\u2019s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.\u201d\nThese comments support Helfstein\u2019s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock\u2019s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein\u2019s track record, click here)\nOverall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street\u2019s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See Meta stock forecast)\nMicrosoft Corporation\nNow on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants \u2013 and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world\u2019s third-largest publicly traded company.\nLike Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it\u2019s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft\u2019s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages.\nMicrosoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market \u2013 $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI\u2019s future profits. Microsoft\u2019s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped.\nThe company\u2019s large AI investment hasn\u2019t just brought it an additional income stream \u2013 Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google.\nAI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google\u2019s Cloud and Amazon\u2019s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users.\nBuilding out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap \u2013 but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company\u2019s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast.\nThe company\u2019s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected \u2013 rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for.\n5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, \u201cWe believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don\u2019t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.\u201d\nHoran follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan\u2019s track record, click here)\nWhile the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

Since Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u00a0ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nTom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year \u201cwell beyond\u201d 5,700.\n\u201cBull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that\u2019s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.\u201d\nLee said that he\u2019s inclined to buy \u201crisks outright\u201d as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.\n\u201cSmall caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are making big moves on the back of latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nDen Rise/Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\nCrowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) seems to be recovering from the widespread outage experienced in July, with analysts from TD Cowen noting that significant customer churn is not anticipated and that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is unlikely to sever ties with the cybersecurity firm.\nIn a recent note, TD Cowen analysts led by Shaul Eyal emphasized, \u201cWe reiterate our view that MSFT is unlikely to cut Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) off from accessing telemetry data out of the kernel given the mission criticality of the Falcon EDR platform product, which is deployed at over 29,000 customers, including 70% of the Fortune 100.\u201d They observed that there does not appear to be significant near-term churn, as customers do not seem to be leaving in the wake of the July outage.\nEyal added that a more accurate assessment of revenue uplift potential will require patience over the next two quarters, allowing management to gain sufficient visibility into the Falcon Flex renewal pipeline. TD Cowen maintains its Buy rating on Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock with a price target of $380.\nDespite the tech outage incident, the fundamental story of Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) remains unchanged. Wedbush Securities estimates that less than 5% of CrowdStrike\u2019s customers might switch providers, potentially impacting revenue by $150 million out of the projected $3 billion in sales for fiscal year 2024. This would lower the company\u2019s forward revenue growth from 30.6% to 25.6%, but even at this adjusted rate, Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u00a0 would remain well above the IT sector median.\nTimesSquare Capital Management U.S. Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

That included the 20% gain from\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD), a cloud-based network security service provider that supports a range of devices, endpoints, and cloud environments. CrowdStrike\u2019s revenues and earnings exceeded expectations, with 33% growth in annual recurring revenue. CrowdStrike continues to see growing momentum in emerging areas such as Cloud Security, Identity, and Security Information & Event Management where it is displacing legacy providers. That led CrowdStrike\u2019s management to increase its guidance for revenues and earnings for the balance of its fiscal year.\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers ",
        "Text": "Microsoft has launched its answer to Google\u2019s AI-powered search experiences: Bing generative search.\nOn the heels of a pilot in July, Bing generative search \u2014 albeit still under development \u2014 began rolling out to all U.S. users this morning. The easiest way to invoke it is by searching \"Bing generative search\" on Bing; Microsoft also said it is introducing an option to more easily trigger Bing generative search for \"informational queries.\"\nUnderpinned by a mix of AI models, Bing generative search aggregates information from around the web to generate a summary in response to search queries. For example, when a user searches \u201cWhat's a spaghetti western?\u201d Bing generative search will show a summary of the genre's history and examples, along with links to sources.\nAs with Google\u2019s similar AI Overviews feature, there\u2019s an option to dismiss AI-generated summaries for traditional search results from the search page.\nBing generative search does more than just find an answer. \"It understands the search query, reviews millions of sources of information, dynamically matches content, and generates search results in a new AI-generated layout to fulfill the intent of the user\u2019s query more effectively,\" Microsoft wrote in a blog post.\nMicrosoft insists that Bing generative search, which evolves the AI-generated chat answers it launched on Bing in February 2023, fulfills the intent of users\u2019 queries more reliably. But much has been written about AI-generated search results going wrong.\nGoogle\u2019s AI Overviews infamously suggested putting glue on a pizza. Arc Search told one reporter that cut-off toes will eventually grow back. Genspark recommends a few weapons that might be used to kill someone. And Perplexity ripped off articles written by outlets such as CNBC, Bloomberg, and Forbes without giving credit or attribution.\nAI-generated overviews threaten to cannibalize traffic to the sites from which they source their information. Indeed, they already are, with one study finding that Google's AI Overviews could negatively affect about 25% of publisher traffic because Overviews de-emphasizes article links.\nMicrosoft promised in July that it would \"look closely at how generative search impacts traffic to publishers,\" and said that it had preliminary data that Bing generative search \"[maintained] the number of clicks to websites.\" But the company shared no new information on that research today.\nOf course, any changes to the Bing experience are guaranteed to be less impactful than Google's moves, given Google's enormous search market advantage. According to Statista, Google had an 81.95% share of the global search market as of September 2024 versus Bing's 10.51%.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/microsoft-brings-ai-powered-overviews-to-bing/\n"

        "Author": "  Krystal Hu ",
        "Text": "By Krystal Hu\n(Reuters) -OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has raised $6.6 billion from investors, which could value the company at $157 billion and cement its position as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\nThe funding has attracted returning venture capital investors including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, as well as OpenAI's biggest corporate backer Microsoft, and new participation from Nvidia.\nThe closing of the funds coincides with the company's ongoing restructuring efforts and executive changes, including the abrupt departure of its longtime Chief Technology Officer, Mira Murati, last week.\nAltimeter Capital, Fidelity, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi's state-backed investment firm MGX also participated in the round.\nOpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees on Wednesday that the company will be able to provide liquidity for them through a tender offer to buy back their shares in the company following the funding, although no details and timing have been decided, according to a source. Earlier this year, the company allowed some employees to cash out their shares at a valuation of $86 billion.\nThrive Capital, which committed about $1.2 billion from a combination of its own fund and a special purpose vehicle for smaller investors, negotiated the option to invest another $1 billion next year at the same valuation if the AI firm hits a revenue goal, sources added.\nApple, which was in talks to invest in OpenAI, did not end up joining the funding, sources said, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe funding came in the form of convertible notes, and the conversion to equity hinges on a successful structural change into a for-profit that would no longer be controlled by the non-profit board and the removal of cap on returns for investors.\nThe personnel changes haven't deterred enthusiasm from most investors, who are anticipating significant growth based on the projections by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\nThe company is on pace to generate $3.6 billion in revenue this year on mounting losses of over $5 billion. It projects major revenue jump next year to $11.6 billion, according to sources familiar with the figures.\nInvestors have also secured some protections as OpenAI undergoes the complex corporate restructuring that would grant Altman equity. The talks are still ongoing, and no timeline has been determined yet.\nInvestors have negotiated terms that would allow them to claw back their capital or renegotiate the valuation if the changes are not implemented within two years, sources said.\nOpenAI's meteoric rise in terms of product popularity and valuation has captured the world's imagination. Since the launch of ChatGPT, it has attracted 250 million weekly active users. The company's valuation has also risen from $14 billion in 2021 to $157 billion as it grew revenue from zero to $3.6 billion, far exceeding Altman's own projections at the time.\nThe company has told investors it is still actively pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning developing AI systems that surpass human intelligence, as it ramps up commercialization and tries to be profitable.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Ken Li and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

        "Title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Microsoft Next?",
        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a long history of stock splits. Its share count has been reshuffled nine times so far, and a single share from 1987 would be a basket of 288 Microsoft stubs today.\nBut Microsoft's latest stock split took place in February of 2003. It's been three decades, and the stock is starting to look pricey. Many investors expect a tenth split fairly soon, especially since Microsoft is a member of the prestigious and price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) index. Allowing the share price to soar much higher might inspire the index managers to drop Microsoft from the component list and pick a lower-priced name instead.\nOr so the thinking goes. Is there any substance to that argument, though?\nBeing a member of the Dow index is a rare badge of honor. There are thousands of stocks on the American market but only 30 get to call themselves \"Dow stocks\" at any given time. Dropping out of popular indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) can be embarrassing. Some investors may sell their shares due to lower confidence in the stock's long-term prospects.\nThat being said, the market effects of joining or leaving a major index tend to be temporary. That membership card doesn't make the holder immune against downturns and market changes. In fact, the Dow often lags behind broader market trackers like the S&P 500 or the Russell 3000 in the long run:\nSo the Dow membership a matter of honor, not a business-boosting asset of material value. Still, holding on to that index seat could be important enough to force Microsoft's hand. If nothing else, it would look silly if the second-largest stock by total market value lost its Dow door pass due to a simple accounting quirk.\nAt the same time, I'm not so sure that the S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) committee that manages the index list will ask Microsoft for a stock split quite yet.\nFirst and foremost, a Dow stock with a $420 share price isn't that outrageous anymore. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) have even higher stock prices; Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) are just a few dollars behind. Microsoft's beefy stock price accounts for just 6.6% of the Dow's total value today. The average and median prices on the Dow are both roughly $200 per share.\nIn other words, high share prices are not an automatic ticket out of Dowsville. Microsoft is an extra-important name on the list, but not a tyrant with an outsized influence over the index value.\nMoreover, the Index Committee isn't forced to kick out Microsoft's stock even if it continues to soar. The group picks 30 names among \"some of the largest U.S. companies,\" taken from the S&P 500 index. Their discussions are always confidential and the committee has the freedom to \"revise index policy\" as needed. And even then, they can make exceptions from the revised rule book. If the team of five S&P Global and Wall Street Journal representatives wanted to bend the rules to keep Microsoft on the list, they would certainly have that power.\nSo Microsoft could keep its share count stable for the foreseeable future without harming the company, the stock, or its investors.\nAt the same time, there isn't much of a downside to taking the stock-split plunge. Microsoft's accounting team might put in some overtime to get the paperwork done, but the actual move wouldn't cost much.\nThe stock exchanges do charge higher fees for a larger share count, but those fees are capped at a few hundred thousand dollars per year. There would be no change in Microsoft's case, and it's just a rounding error in the company's earnings reports anyhow.\nAgainst that backdrop, I don't expect Microsoft to announce a stock split in 2024 or 2025. The company could surprise me and make the move anyway, but it's no big deal. Stock splits don't create investor value and I showed you why the Dow membership issue probably won't force Microsoft's hand.\nAnd the company is doing business in software and computing -- not in maintaining a specific stock price or being a Dow Jones member. Investors should weigh Microsoft's stock value against its business prospects, not an arbitrary accounting move.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "\u2018Comfortable, fun, familiar\u2019: Why Microsoft is trying to turn its AI chatbot into a digital friend",
        "Author": "  Clare Duffy, CNN ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence chatbots have been billed as productivity tools for consumers \u2014 they can help you plan a trip, for example, or give advice on writing a confrontational email to your landlord. But they often sound stilted or oddly stubborn or just downright weird.\nAnd despite the proliferation of chatbots and other AI tools, many people still struggle to trust them and haven\u2019t necessarily wanted to use them on a daily basis.\nNow, Microsoft is trying to fix that, by focusing on its chatbot\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d and how it makes users feel, not just what it can do for them.\nMicrosoft on Tuesday announced a major update to Copilot, its AI system, that it says marks the first step toward creating an \u201cAI companion\u201d for users.\nThe updated Copilot has new capabilities, including real-time voice interactions and the ability to interpret images and text on users\u2019 screens. Microsoft also says it\u2019s one of the fastest AI models on the market. But the most important innovation, according to the company, is that the chatbot will now interact with users in a \u201cwarm tone and a distinct style, providing not only information but encouragement, feedback, and advice as you navigate life\u2019s everyday challenges.\u201d\nThe changes could help Microsoft\u2019s Copilot stand out in a growing sea of general-purpose AI chatbots. When Microsoft launched Copilot, then called Bing, early last year, it was seen as a leader among its big tech peers in the AI arms race. But in the intervening 18 months, it\u2019s been leapfrogged by competitors with new features, like bots that can have voice conversations, and easily accessible (albeit imperfect) AI integrations with tools people already use regularly, like Google Search. With the update, Copilot is catching up with some of those capabilities.\nWhen I tried out the new Copilot Voice feature at Microsoft\u2019s launch event Tuesday, I asked for advice on how to support a friend who is about to have her first baby. The bot responded with practical tips, like providing meals and running errands, but it also provided more touchy-feely advice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exciting news!\u201d the tool said in an upbeat male voice \u2014 Copilot is designed to subtly mirror users\u2019 tone \u2014 that the company calls Canyon. \u201cBeing there for her emotionally is a big one. Listen to her, reassure her and be her cheerleader \u2026 Don\u2019t forget to celebrate this moment with her.\u201d\nCopilot\u2019s update reflects Microsoft\u2019s vision for how everyday people will use AI as the technology develops. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman contends that people need AI to be more than a productivity tool, they need it to be a kind of digital friend.\n\u201cI think in the future, the first thought you\u2019re going to have is, \u2018Hey, Copilot,\u2019\u201d Suleyman told CNN in an interview ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to ask your AI companion to remember it, or to buy it, or to book it, or to help me plan it, or to teach me it \u2026 It\u2019s going to be a confidence boost, it\u2019s going to be there to back you up, it\u2019s going to be your hype man, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be present across many, many surfaces, like all of your devices, in your car, in your home, and it really will start to live life alongside you.\u201d\nThe earlier iteration of the Microsoft AI chatbot received some backlash for unexpected changes in tone and sometimes downright concerning responses. The bot would start off an interaction sounding empathetic but could turn sassy or rude during long exchanges. In one instance, the bot told a New York Times reporter he should leave his wife because \u201cI just want to love you and be loved by you.\u201d (Microsoft later limited the number of messages users can exchange with the chatbot in any one session, to prevent such responses.)\nSome experts have also raised broader concerns about people forming emotional attachments to bots that sound too human at the expense of their real-world relationships.\nTo address those concerns while still developing Copilot\u2019s personality, Microsoft has a team of dozens of creative directors, language specialists, psychologists and other non-technical workers to interact with the model and give it feedback about the ideal ways to respond.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really crafted an AI model that is designed for conversation, so it feels more fluent, it\u2019s more friendly,\u201d Suleyman told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s got, you know, real energy \u2026 Like, it\u2019s got character. It pushes back occasionally, it can be a little bit funny, and it\u2019s really optimizing for this long-term conversational exchange, rather than a question-answer thing.\u201d\nSuleyman added that if you tell the new Copilot that you love it and would like to get married, \u201cit\u2019s going to know that that isn\u2019t something it should be talking to you about. It will remind you, politely and respectfully, that that\u2019s not what it\u2019s here for.\u201d\nAnd to avoid the kinds of criticisms that dogged OpenAI over a chatbot voice that resembled actor Scarlett Johansson, Microsoft paid voice actors to provide training data for four voice options that are intentionally designed not to imitate well-known figures.\n\u201cImitation is confusing. These things aren\u2019t human and they shouldn\u2019t try to be human,\u201d Suleyman said. \u201cThey should give us enough of a sense that they\u2019re comfortable and fun and familiar to talk to, while still being separate and distant \u2026 that boundary is how we form trust.\u201d\nBuilding on the voice feature, the new Copilot will have a \u201cdaily\u201d feature that reads users the weather and a summary of news updates each day, thanks to partnerships with news outlets like Reuters, the Financial Times and others.\nMicrosoft has also built Copilot into its Microsoft Edge browser \u2014 when users need a question answered or text translated, they can type @copilot into the address bar to chat with the tool.\nPower users who want to experiment with features still in development will have access to what Microsoft is calling \u201cCopilot Labs.\u201d They can test new features like \u201cThink Deeper,\u201d which the company says can reason through more complex questions, and \u201cCopilot Vision,\u201d which can see what\u2019s on your computer screen and answer questions or suggest next steps.\nAfter some backlash over privacy risks with a similar AI tool it released for Windows earlier this year, called Recall, Microsoft says Copilot Vision sessions are entirely opt-in and none of the content it sees is stored or used for training.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Author": "  DPA ",
        "Text": "US technology company Microsoft will invest \u20ac4.3 billion ($4.7 billion) in Italy in the next two years, aiming to expand the country's hyperscale cloud and artificial intelligence or AI datacentre infrastructure.\nIn its largest investment in Italy to date, the tech company said it will also provide digital skills training to more than 1 million Italians by the end of 2025.\nWith the move, the company aims to help maximize the AI opportunities for Italy, and to contribute to Italian government's focus on long-term economic growth and demographic challenge amid the rising demand for AI computer and cloud services.\nBrad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft said, \"By expanding access to our AI technology and expertise, we are equipping the Italian government, businesses, and the broader workforce with the tools to build an AI-driven economy that creates jobs and drives prosperity.\"\nWith the investment, Italy North is expected to play a crucial role in meeting European data boundary requirements, and to serve as a key data hub for the Mediterranean and North Africa.\nMicrosoft noted that by integrating AI into strategic sectors, Italy can innovate production processes, improve patient outcomes, enhance financial services, and increase the efficiency of public services.\nThe new infrastructure will operate under Microsoft's AI Access Principles.\nMicrosoft said the planned new training programs to skill more than 1 million people in Italy by 2025 would focus on AI fluency, technical AI skills, AI business transformation, and the promotion of safe and responsible AI development.\nThe company also plans to launch skilling initiatives for professionals and students across Italy, included in disadvantaged communities.\nIn Italy, Generative AI holds the potential to enhance productivity and well-being, even in the face of a talent shortage and an aging population. It is projected that about 3.7 million workers would depart the workforce by 2040 in Italy, resulting in \u20ac267.8 billion in national GDP at present productivity level, and that new technologies would make it possible to maintain the same level of economic well-being.\nAccording to a recent study by TEHA Group and Microsoft Italy, 63% of Italian entrepreneurs acknowledge a lack of Generative AI skills. However, broad adoption of this technology could boost Italy's annual GDP by up to \u20ac312 billion over the next 15 years, an 18.2% increase. The SMEs and Made in Italy companies, a major strategic sector of the Italian Economy, could benefit from an increase of \u20ac122 billion in added value.\nIn May, Microsoft joined with major companies including Amazon.com Inc., Morgan Stanley, Pfizer, and others, to announce around $16.2 billion worth foreign investments in France as part of the country's annual 'Choose France' business summit.\nMicrosoft reportedly plans to invest $4.3 billion in France, mainly to focus on the AI sector.\nMicrosoft also announced a $3.3 billion investment in Wisconsin, aiming to turn the US state into a center of AI innovation and enhance its economic growth.\nIn April, the company announced its proposed investment of $1.7 billion in Indonesia over the next four years to build new cloud and AI infrastructure.\n"

The acquisition positions CrashPlan to deliver the industry\u2019s most comprehensive backup and recovery capabilities for data stored on servers, on endpoint devices and in Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams to Azure, their cloud, or to CrashPlan\u2019s proprietary cloud.\n\u201cOrganizations of all sizes worldwide rely heavily upon Microsoft applications to store their most valued intellectual property,\u201d said CrashPlan CEO John Becker. \u201cRecent events like the UniSuper incident have reminded organizations that it is mission-critical to back up the valuable data stored on their platforms. In fact, the responsibility to regularly backup data is assigned to users by nearly every SaaS platform\u2019s terms and conditions.\u201d\nThe Parablu acquisition enables CrashPlan to offer a complete cyber-ready data resilience solution that protects intellectual property (IP) and other data from accidental data deletion, ransomware, and Microsoft service interruptions.\nIn addition to providing data protection and the ability to recover quickly from ransomware incidents, the combined technology can help customers store backup data with no additional costs by leveraging existing OneDrive and Azure infrastructure. Parablu earned a patent for its technology\u2019s integration with Microsoft OneDrive for Business and Google Drive, allowing enterprises with Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace subscriptions to use unused portions of their OneDrive for Business or Google Drive storage as secure backup repositories. Because CrashPlan has its own proprietary cloud infrastructure with data centers around the globe rather than relying on third-party cloud providers, customers can also take advantage of unlimited backup for endpoints and low-cost storage for servers and SaaS application backups.\n\u201cCustomers frequently come up against storage limits and turn to Parablu for archiving to save money while retaining rich data access,\u201d said Parablu CEO and President Anand Prahlad, who will now act as CTO for CrashPlan. \u201cWe have seen even higher demand for M365 and Google Workspace protection over the last year as businesses have come to understand their shared responsibility for data backup.\u201d\n\u201cIdea workers\u201d and the backup gapM365 risk is just one dimension of a growing problem inside of intellectual property-intensive businesses: a backup gap. In these organizations, data is distributed, and dozens of \u2018idea workers\u2019 \u2013 media, researchers, designers, engineers, architects, even lawyers \u2013 are constantly iterating within a number of specialized applications. Their files are often multiversion and very large, making backup trickier and endpoints riskier. Backup tools originally built to be used by IT departments for Oracle and SAP databases just don\u2019t meet their needs.\n\u201cToday\u2019s idea workers create and store enormous value for their organizations \u2013 and without the right backup tools in place, weeks, even months of work can be lost in an instant,\u201d added Becker. \u201cAt CrashPlan, we are building the first comprehensive cyber-ready data resiliency platform for organizations whose ideas power their revenue.\u201d\nAbout CrashPlanCrashPlan\u00ae enables organizational resilience through secure, scalable, and straightforward data backup. With automatic backup and customizable file version retention, you can bounce back from any data calamity. What starts as backup and recovery becomes a solution for ransomware recovery, breaches, migrations, and legal holds.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing.

As part of this effort, it has invested nearly $13 billion in OpenAI of ChatGPT fame. Following the latest funding round, where OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in new funding, the startup is now valued at more than $157 billion, making it the highest valued private company in the US, overtaking SpaceX by Elon Musk.

        "Text": "SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Instructure, the leading learning technology ecosystem and maker of Canvas LMS, is proud to announce a newly available complimentary integration of Microsoft Reflect into Canvas, a step designed to enhance global mental wellness support for students and educators just in time for World Mental Health Day on October 10. The integration aims to streamline social-emotional learning (SEL) within the digital classroom, through K-12 to higher education, making mental wellness resources more accessible to all Canvas users.\n\"Integrating Microsoft Reflect within Canvas makes it an even more powerful platform to support student learning and wellbeing,\" said Elad Graiver, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft Education. \"By embedding SEL check-ins into daily routines, schools create a space for student voice, giving every learner the opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings openly. This immediate feedback empowers educators to make timely adjustments, fostering a more supportive and engaging classroom environment.\"\nTo further support mental wellness initiatives, Instructure recently introduced a new Mental Wellness Hub within its Community. This collaborative online space is where 2.25 million educators and learners connect to share and enhance the learning experience. The Wellness Hub serves as a central resource, offering best practices, professional development and a supportive forum for educators and administrators to discuss strategies for promoting mental health in educational settings.\n\"At Instructure, we believe mental wellness is foundational to successful learning,\" said Melissa Loble, Chief Academic Officer at Instructure. \"We're committed to supporting the whole learner by providing tools and resources that foster emotional well-being and create a positive, supportive environment for both students and educators. When mental health is prioritized, meaningful learning and growth can truly thrive.\"\nInstructure's focus on mental health reflects a broader trend in education: the increasing need to address students' and educators' emotional well-being as a key component of academic success. Recent research by the Healthy Minds Network, which surveys tens of thousands of students across the United States each year about mental health, indicates that almost 40% of students screened positive for moderate or severe depressive symptoms. In comparison, 68% of faculty felt \"overwhelmed\" by all they had to do, making accessible mental wellness tools more essential than ever.\nThe integration and new Hub will be spotlighted on Instructure's social channels throughout October, featuring tips, resources, and podcasts to help educators use these tools effectively. World Mental Health Day reminds us of the importance of fostering healthy, supportive learning environments, and Instructure is dedicated to providing its community with the resources it needs to make mental health a priority \u2013 today and every day.\nFor more information, visit Microsoft Reflect and the Canvas LMS website.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").

        "Title": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Microsoft Corp's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus News ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-10-14, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $357.28. It's currently trading at a price of $416.32. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -16.52%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.82\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.1%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 19.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n181.42\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n175.86\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n357.28\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $205.86. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -102.23%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks.\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. The company announced earlier this week that it would be investing $2.7 billion in Brazil over the course of three years as part of an effort to foster the development of an artificial intelligence \u200b\u200becosystem in the South American country. When completed, the investment would be the biggest single investment for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in Brazil.\nThe money would be directed towards the expansion of cloud and AI infrastructure across multiple datacenter campuses. The firm will also launch a ConnectAI program to provide AI skills training to 5 million people, with the goal of addressing the AI-driven workforce shift.\nOn the enterprise side, per the analyst, Llama was becoming a serious contender and the advisory saw momentum building with the new multimodal capabilities.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Prosper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Getting to a $1 trillion market cap is such a challenging milestone that only a handful of corporations have done it. The list includes several tech giants, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Though this elite club is highly exclusive, more companies will eventually join it. Stocks that are headed that way might be worth serious consideration. Let's look at two: Visa (NYSE: V) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO). These companies could be trillion-dollar stocks by 2030.\nVisa runs one of the largest payment networks in the world, helping facilitate millions of daily credit card transactions. The company has delivered excellent returns during the past decade as cash transactions continue to be replaced by other payment forms. Visa's market cap is just under $550 billion as of this writing -- so it needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 10.5% to become a trillion-dollar company by the end of 2030. That's well within the company's powers. For one, Visa has performed much better than that during the past decade.\nOf course, that doesn't guarantee the company will deliver the same returns in the future, but some of the underlying factors that led to such solid performances in the past for the business are still in place. Visa remains a leader in its industry, with its only true noteworthy competitor being Mastercard (NYSE: MA). Visa still benefits from network effects: The more people carry credit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive its ecosystem becomes to merchants, and vice versa. That helps ensure that it will remain a major player in this industry for a while.\nVisa also still has plenty of room to grow. Credit card penetration is relatively high in many developed countries, but not so in others. In developing countries, there is even more potential. Visa sees a $20 trillion opportunity across a range of payments it can capture. The company's revenue of about $35 billion in the trailing 12-month period is a tiny percentage of that total. If Visa can make headway in its addressable market, the company's revenue, earnings, and stock price should move in the same direction they have during the past 10 years.\nThe company is well-equipped to deliver a CAGR of more than 10.5% through 2030.\nAs of this writing, Novo Nordisk's market cap is about $400 billion. To hit $1 trillion, it would need a CAGR of about 16.5%. That would be an impressive average to maintain for six years, but Novo Nordisk has been more than impressive recently. Brand names like Wegovy and Ozempic have become famous. Both are GLP-1 medicines that treat obesity and diabetes, respectively. Novo Nordisk has been one of the pioneers in the GLP-1 weight loss market, which is now attracting pharmaceutical companies left and right.\nSome analysts estimate that the weight loss drug market will hit $150 billion by the early 2030s -- it was worth just $24 billion last year. And although there will be plenty of challengers, Novo Nordisk's pipeline in this field is second to none. The company's most promising programs include an oral medicine called amycretin, and CagriSema, which some have estimated could generate as much as $20.2 billion in revenue by 2030.\nThat barely scratches the surface of Novo Nordisk's pipeline, though. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) is being tested in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, two areas with high unmet needs. The company is developing several other diabetes and obesity medicines, and a range of treatments for various rare diseases. Novo Nordisk's revenue has grown rapidly during the past five years, as have its stock price and market cap.\nThe drugmaker should earn important approvals during the next few years, which will help it continue generating excellent financial results through the end of the decade. Becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2030 is well within Novo Nordisk's reach, and it should continue beating the market beyond that.\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models.

This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "Text": "Microsoft is going to pay publishers for content that will appear in Copilot Daily, a new feature of its Copilot AI-powered, cross-platform assistant.\nCopilot Daily, announced on Tuesday alongside other Copilot upgrades, gives users a spoken summary of the weather and current events. Alexa and Google Assistant have long delivered similar daily briefs, but Microsoft describes its take as \"an antidote to that familiar feeling of information overload.\"\n\"Clean, simple and easy to digest, Copilot Daily will only pull from authorized content sources,\" Microsoft writes in a blog post, adding that options for reminders and customization will arrive over time.\nReuters, Axel Springer, Hearst Magazines, USA Today Network, and The Financial Times are signed on for Copilot Daily, which is only available in the U.S. and U.K. at launch. Microsoft won't reveal how much it's paying publishers, nor the other terms of the arrangements, but the company did say it plans to add publishers and expand Copilot Daily to new countries \"soon.\"\nMicrosoft has been compensating publishers for many years in the form of content-licensing deals for its MSN platform. But until now, those licensing deals didn't cover the company's AI products.\nNone of the Copilot Daily publisher partners responded to TechCrunch's request for comment as of publication time.\nThe partnerships come at a time when some AI vendors, including OpenAI, Perplexity, and even Apple, embrace payment deals partly to shield against claims that their AI tools infringe on copyrighted works. (Microsoft itself is involved in a lawsuit that alleges it used millions of New York Times articles to train chatbots that now compete with the organization.) Many of the deals give AI vendors sorely needed data to train their models. According to one estimate, the market for AI training data could\u00a0grow\u00a0to close to $30 billion within a decade.\nPerplexity recently began sharing ad revenue with publishers when its AI-powered search tool surfaces their articles in response to a query. OpenAI, meanwhile, is licensing content from publishers, including Cond\u00e9 Nast, Time, News Corp, Vox Media and the Associated Press.\nSome publishers, writers, and unions have criticized the structure of these deals, saying they undervalue journalism. For context, OpenAI's lower-end checks reportedly range from $1 million to $5 million annually. Others have noted their poor execution; as of June, OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot was producing links to news partners' stories that didn't work.\nBut the news sector is desperate for a break.\nThe industry could be on track to shed 10,000 jobs this year,\u00a0per\u00a0Fast Company. That\u2019d be an improvement from last year, which saw over 21,400 journalism jobs eliminated, but it\u2019s hardly a sunny outlook.\nMany factors are contributing to the decline, from slow-growing ad budgets to inflation (which is hurting subscriptions). The struggle to find a sustainable business model hasn\u2019t been helped by Big Tech, either \u2014 their search and feed algorithm changes, in addition to\u00a0AI-generated\u00a0search overviews,\u00a0have reduced traffic to news sites.\nPundits argue that tech has also trained people to expect free content \u2014\u00a0nearly half of all U.S. residents get their news from social media \u2014 and captured an increasing share of ad dollars at the expense of publishers. Approximately 60% of global ad spend is now\u00a0funneled\u00a0toward Big Tech companies, including Google and Meta. One\u00a0study\u00a0found that broadcasters lose nearly $2 billion in ad revenue annually to Google's and Meta\u2019s platforms.\n"

        "Title": "After Microsoft's Landmark Deal With Constellation Energy, Could This Little-Known Stock Be the Next Big Opportunity in Nuclear Power?",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Data centers house IT architecture such as server racks that store advanced chipsets called graphics processing units (GPU) -- a critical piece of infrastructure for AI development.\nOne drawback of data centers, however, is power consumption. Since GPUs are running sophisticated algorithms around the clock, data centers experience high levels of heat and consume a lot of energy. At the moment, some of the most common pieces of equipment outfitting data centers include air conditioning units, fans, and generators.\nWhile these products work, there are questions about their long-term viability. For this reason, nuclear power is emerging as an alternative and more efficient solution over traditional data center energy solutions.\nJust a couple of weeks ago, Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy, and the two companies are looking to restart nuclear power plants on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. Shares of Constellation have been surging on the news of this partnership. Naturally, investors are now looking for the next big opportunity at the intersection of AI and nuclear power.\nBelow, I'll explore a little-known nuclear power company called Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) and assess if the stock could be a lucrative opportunity.\nAccording to its website, Oklo is a \"fission technology and nuclear fuel recycling company.\" Its core project is called the Aurora powerhouse, which is essentially a fission reactor that leverages recycled nuclear waste. This technology could revolutionize data center operations, making them less reliant on traditional power grids.\nBefore going public, Oklo received funding from a number of high-profile venture capital firms. Among its more notable investors are OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and billionaire Silicon Valley legend Peter Thiel. Moreover, the company has received interest for its reactors from the likes of Diamondback Energy, Equinix, Centrus Energy and the United States Air Force.\nOn the surface, Oklo looks pretty impressive. But smart investors know there is always more to uncover when assessing smaller businesses. Oklo is no exception, and I've found some important things to keep in mind with this under-the-radar energy stock.\nOklo started trading on the New York Stock Exchange back in May after merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). SPACs are a somewhat unusual way of going public, as they circumvent traditional underwriting processes at investment banks. Over the last couple of years, SPACs have risen in popularity.\nHere's the inconvenient reality of SPAC stocks. Many market themselves as cutting-edge businesses, but have yet to show tangible results. As a result, after an initial surge fueled by investor euphoria, SPAC stocks often wind up selling off as a more sober assessment sets in.\nAccording to a study at the University of Florida, renewable energy SPACs have a median return of negative 84% between 2009 and 2024. It's too early to tell where Oklo's share price will end up, but I see some reasons why the stock could begin to decline.\nWhile the Aurora powerhouse carries some allure, Oklo's first plant isn't expected to be functional until 2027. Until then, the company will likely remain a pre-revenue business that requires ongoing investment in capital expenditures (capex). As a result, I would not be surprised to see the company pressed for liquidity and potentially dilute shareholders in an effort to keep the operation afloat.\nI find Oklo's nuclear power solutions intriguing, but I have my doubts about how investable the business is at its current stage. For now, I see Oklo as quite risky and, at best, a speculative opportunity.\nI think the more prudent strategy is to invest in higher-quality businesses that are already making moves at the crossroads of nuclear power and AI. In addition to Microsoft and Constellation Energy, Amazon and Vistra are some big names worth keeping an eye on. As far as Oklo goes, I think it's best to sit on the sidelines and monitor the company's progress over time.\nBefore you buy stock in Oklo, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oklo wasn\u2019t one of them.

AI breakthroughs are changing, augmenting how we work and live,\u201d Kees Hertogh, vice president for healthcare and life sciences product marketing, said during a press briefing. \u201cThe integration of AI into healthcare has significantly enhanced patient care and is rekindling the joy of practicing medicine for clinicians.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s agent service would allow companies to create AI tools with pre-built templates and data sources that could be used for appointment scheduling, clinical trial matching and patient triage, Hertogh said.\nThe service is currently in public preview, which allows wider access to the tools and lets organizations give feedback on the product, according to a spokesperson.\nIn one example, a doctor could ask an AI agent to find clinical trials for a 55-year-old patient with diabetes and interstitial lung disease.\nThe tools could also be geared toward patients. Cleveland Clinic used the agent service to build tools that allow patients to ask health questions and navigate the health system\u2019s services, according to a spokesperson.\nThe product allows organizations to build agents with healthcare-specific features using intelligence from credible sources, which aims to improve safety, said Hadas Bitran, partner general manager of health AI at Microsoft Health and Life Sciences.\nThe tech company is also releasing additional application programming interfaces, or APIs, in private preview that can help verify the model\u2019s output, like features for detecting omissions or linking answers to grounding data, she said.\nMicrosoft also revealed foundation models, or systems built on broad datasets that can be used for a number of tasks, focused on medical imaging.\nThe models, developed with partners like health system Providence and digital pathology company Paige.ai, would allow healthcare organizations to build their own AI tools without the hefty data and computing resources needed to build them from scratch.\nThe foundation models include MedImageInsight, which allows image analysis that can be used for automatically sending scans to specialists or flagging abnormalities for review.\nMedImageParse is aimed at image segmentation, which could be used for segmenting tumors or outlining organs at risk before radiotherapy for cancer patients.\nThe third model, CXRReportGen, creates reports based on chest X-rays, which Microsoft said could speed image analysis and improve radiologists\u2019 diagnostic accuracy.\nThe tech giant said healthcare-specific data tools are now generally available in Microsoft Fabric, the company\u2019s analytics product. The platform allows organizations to ingest, store and analyze health data.\n\u201cThe analytical enrichments can help them enhance reporting with details like patients\u2019 geographic distribution, age, gender and more, as well as the state of patient outcomes and satisfaction,\u201d Hertogh said.\nOrganizations will also be able to use other data types in public preview, like conversational information from Microsoft\u2019s DAX Copilot AI documentation tool, public social determinants of health information and claims data from the CMS. Also in public preview, the tech giant released healthcare security templates in Microsoft Purview, the company\u2019s data security and governance offering.\nMicrosoft is working with electronic health record vendor Epic and several health systems \u2014 like Advocate Health, Northwestern Medicine, Duke Health and Stanford Healthcare \u2014 to develop an AI documentation tool for nurses.\nMicrosoft-owned Nuance Communications made its automated clinical documentation tool DAX Copilot generally available last year. The tool records conversations between clinicians and patients and drafts clinical summaries.\nThe nurse-focused product has been deployed at multiple customer sites, according to Mary Varghese Presti, vice president of portfolio evolution and incubation at Microsoft Health and Life Sciences. The tool uses ambient voice technology to automatically draft flowsheets, or forms that collect patient data, for nurse review.\n\u201cFor nurses, documentation is really more data entry. Their back is to the patient, their faces to the computer,\u201d Presti said. \u201c[...] We aspire to enable nurses to be eyes-free and hands-free in their documentation.\u201d\n"

Nvidia stock, for example, was up 156% through the first half of 2024, which accounted for one-third of the entire 15% gain in the S&P 500.\nIn other words, investors who don't have America's tech giants in their portfolio are probably underperforming the broader market.

Microsoft\n12.68%\n6.54%\n3. Nvidia\n11.29%\n6.20%\n4. Meta Platforms\n4.96%\n2.41%\n5. Amazon\n4.54%\n3.45%\nData source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Aug. 31, and are subject to change.\nHaving a much higher weighting toward these stocks can be a double-edged sword. It means the Vanguard ETF will outperform the S&P 500 when those specific stocks are doing well, but it's likely to underperform if they hit a rough patch, because it lacks diversity relative to the index.\nWith that said, these five companies are among the most important players in the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Apple is rolling out its Apple Intelligence software, which it developed in partnership with OpenAI. It's going to transform the way iPhone, iPad, and Mac users create and consume content. Since Apple has over 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, the company could soon become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers.\nMicrosoft and Amazon have developed their own AI virtual assistants, which are embedded into their flagship software products. Plus, the Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services cloud platforms are two of the largest AI distribution channels for businesses, allowing them to access ready-made models and data center computing power for their development needs.\nNvidia's graphics processing chips (GPUs) for the data center are at the heart of the entire AI revolution. Its H100 GPU set the benchmark for AI developers last year, and the company is preparing to ship large volumes of its new Blackwell-based GPUs, which will deliver an incredible leap in performance and cost efficiency.\nOutside its top five positions, the Vanguard ETF also holds popular megacap stocks like Eli Lilly, Tesla, Costco Wholesale, and McDonald's -- so it isn't all about technology.\nThe Vanguard ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 13.1% since it was established in 2007, which is much better than the average annual return of 10.2% in the S&P 500.\nThe ETF has delivered an even stronger compound annual return of 20.2% over the last five years. That's because of the rapid adoption of technologies like cloud computing and AI, which have propelled stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon to multitrillion-dollar valuations. The S&P 500 has gained 16.7% per year (on average) over that same stretch.\nIn other words, if technology stocks continue to lead the broader market higher, investors should expect the Vanguard ETF to outperform the S&P 500 because of its enormous exposure to the sector. Some forecasts on Wall Street suggest AI could add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy over the next decade. If that's true, tech stocks will be one of the best places to invest.\nConversely, if AI fails to live up to the hype, the Vanguard ETF could underperform for a period of time because stocks like Nvidia would lose a chunk of the value they have created over the last couple of years.\nThis Vanguard ETF is very cheap to own, with an expense ratio of just 0.07% (the portion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs), which is more than 90% cheaper than comparable funds, according to Vanguard. Therefore, investors seeking exposure to the big end of the stock market without having to pick individual winners and losers should look no further.\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Generation Investment Management, an investment management firm, released its \u201cGlobal Equity Strategy\u201d second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of letter can be downloaded here. The strategy\u2019s recent net performance was behind market averages. Since the fund\u2019s inception, the strategy has underperformed for about 8% of the time on a rolling five-year basis. Several factors have contributed to the current underperformance, including not owning Nvidia, which explains about a third of the relative underperformance year-to-date. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions. The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 5.09%, and its shares gained 37.30% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 30, 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $430.30 per share with a market capitalization of $3.198 trillion.\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cGenerative AI\u2019s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called \u2018inference\u2019). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category \u2013 nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google\u2019s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in second position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 279 hedge fund portfolios held Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) at the end of the second quarter which was 293 in the previous quarter. In the\u00a0quarter, Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) revenue was $64.7 billion, up 15% in reported currency and 16% in constant currency and earnings per share was $2.95, representing a 10% increase in reported currency and an 11% increase in constant currency.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close up of a wind turbine producing electricity as the sun sets.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\u00a0\nConstellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) generates and sells electricity in the United States. UBS recently raised the price target on the stock to $307 from $230 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The advisory highlighted that Constellation had announced a contract with Microsoft to provide long-term, dedicated power from the restarted Crane plant, and the broad implications from the announcement are a reaffirmation of the demand for power from large technology companies and the willingness to pay up for access to large quantities of clean energy. Per the advisory, this is another signaling event in the power demand thesis that demonstrates a very supportive fundamental backdrop for power.\nOverall CEG ranks 21st on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Yet, security professionals highlight lack of skills and cost as barriers to building3.\u00a0Darktrace / CLOUD helps organizations tackle these challenges head on.\nEnabling teams through real-time understanding, detection and response in the cloud\nAlso available for AWS deployments, Darktrace / CLOUD is built from the ground up for cloud defense. It leverages Darktrace's unique Self-Learning AI to monitor cloud assets, containers and users, and correlate that activity with identity and network data from across an organization's digital ecosystem. This contextualized understanding enables Darktrace / CLOUD to provide proactive detection, investigation and response to malicious activity across cloud environments, within seconds.\nDarktrace's Self-Learning AI also enables Darktrace / CLOUD to deliver automated Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM). It continuously assesses cloud configurations against industry standards, and allows security teams to identify and prioritize misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and policy violations in real-time. These capabilities give security teams a complete, live understanding of their cloud environments and help them focus their limited time and resources where they are needed most.\n\"At Centre Parcs, we've brought WiFi to the forest. Our network enables everything down to ordering food or paying for an activity with a QR code and smartphone. Cloud is central to that,\" comments Haider Kubba, Group Information Security Officer at Center Parcs, the UK's leading short break vacation destination, running six vacation villages in the UK and Republic of Ireland.\n\"Cloud audit logging and audit review, and the flexibility of cloud in general, is amazing for business \u2013 but it's also a challenge for security, and it's on the security team to say 'Yes, we can absolutely make this happen securely'. With Darktrace, I know my cloud formation, my cloud infrastructure, the environment in which a lot of guests will be interacting with, is secure.\"\nOrla McGrath, Global Partner Solutions Lead, UK, Microsoft adds, \"Darktrace / CLOUD is an exciting expansion of Darktrace and Microsoft's longstanding collaboration. It brings real-time cloud detection and response to Microsoft Azure customers, and through Darktrace's integration with virtual network flow logs, makes accessing that new level of security fast and simple.\"\nSimplified deployment with Microsoft Azure\nDarktrace / CLOUD is one of the first security systems to integrate with Microsoft Azure's virtual network flow logs for agentless deployment into the cloud. By leveraging virtual network flow logs, Darktrace / CLOUD automatically captures network data and integrates into Azure cloud environments with minimal manual effort beyond initial configuration. Consequently, deployment times are reduced to as little as 15 minutes, from several weeks, common for agent-based systems, and several days with most agentless systems.\n\"The availability of Darktrace / CLOUD in Microsoft Azure offers new security opportunities for single and multi-cloud users, including improved identity and access management (IAM), which has been voted by European security leaders as the top cloud security challenge facing their organizations in 2024. It also offers new possibilities for agentless cloud detection and response, taking advantage of Azure's new virtual network flow logs,\" said David Clemente, IDC.\nLowered cloud operating costs through agentless deployment\nDarktrace / CLOUD's agentless approach additionally lowers the cost of operating cloud by eliminating the CPU and memory consumption associated with cloud security agents. Through Darktrace / CLOUD's agentless approach, the need for dedicated resources per cloud instance is reduced and performance impact minimized. Teams can scale their security across their cloud architecture without the cost of additional agents.\n\"As organizations rapidly transition to the cloud, cloud detection and response are becoming critical to ensuring safety and security, but personnel and cost are proving notable barriers to their effective deployment,\" comments Max Heinemeyer, Chief Product Officer at Darktrace.\n\"We built Darktrace / CLOUD to help teams protect their cloud with the resources they have. Using our Self-Learning AI, integrated with Microsoft Azure, it deploys quickly and easily then provides teams with constant visibility, autonomous investigation and real-time response without ballooning operating costs.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nGlobal management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nBain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks.\nThe research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

David Tepper of Appaloosa Management has taken aim at companies projecting that nuclear energy will power the AI boom, terming projections in this regard crazy and instead highlighting the potential of natural gas for the purpose. The comments come in the wake of a major rally in Constellation Energy stock following the announcement of a 20-year nuclear deal with tech giant Microsoft. Tepper made the comments during an appearance on news platform CNBC. The hedge fund manager stressed that in order to meet AI power, companies would have to think about using natural gas.\nConstellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) will spend nearly $1.6 billion under the Microsoft deal to revive a nuclear plant. The energy firm expects it to come online by 2028. The company is also expecting to renew the license that would extend plant operations to at least 2054.\nOverall CEG ranks 7th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "By Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft has given its consumer Copilot, an artificial intelligence assistant, a more amiable voice in its latest update, with the chatbot also capable of analyzing web pages for interested users as they browse.\nThe U.S. software maker now has \"an entire army\" of creative directors - among them psychologists, novelists and comedians - finessing the tone and style of Copilot to distinguish it, Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, told Reuters in an interview.\nIn one demonstration of the updated Copilot, a consumer asked what housewarming gift to buy at a grocery store for a friend who did not drink wine. After some back-and-forth, Copilot said aloud: \"Italian (olive) oils are the hot stuff right now. Tuscan's my go-to. Super peppery.\"\nThe feature rollout, starting Tuesday, is one of the first that Suleyman has overseen since Microsoft created his division in March to focus on consumer products and technology research.\nLong identified with business software, Microsoft has had a much harder road in the consumer realm. Its Bing search engine, for instance, is still dwarfed by Google.\nSuleyman is hoping for a bigger splash with Copilot, which launched last year in a crowded field of AI chatbots, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\nCopilot's newly fashioned voice capabilities make it seem much more of an active listener, giving verbal cues like \"cool\" and \"huh,\" Suleyman said.\nUnderlying the product are Microsoft AI, or \"MAI,\" models, plus a technology suite from partner OpenAI, Suleyman said.\nSuleyman added that consumers who spend $20 monthly for Copilot Pro can start testing a \"Think Deeper\" feature that reasons through choices, like whether to move to one city or another.\nHe said an additional test feature for paying subscribers, Copilot Vision, amounts to \"digital pointing\" - the ability for users to talk to AI about what they see in a Microsoft Edge browser. Consumers have to opt in, and the content they view will not be saved or used to train AI, Microsoft said.\nThese updates represent \"glimmers\" of AI that can be an \"ever-present confidant, in your corner,\" Suleyman said. It's a vision he articulated as CEO of Inflection AI, whose top talent Microsoft poached in a closely watched deal this year.\nSuleyman said that eventually, Copilot will learn context from consumers' Word documents, Windows desktops, even their gaming consoles if they grant permission.\nAsked what Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, thinks of the company's AI efforts, Suleyman said Gates was excited.\n\"He's always asking me about when Copilot can read and parse his emails. It's one of his favorite ones,\" Suleyman said. \"We're on the case.\"\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp., eager to demonstrate a payoff from its huge investments in artificial intelligence, is adding voice and vision features to its consumer-focused AI assistant.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSingapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes\nFrom Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\nWhat Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars?\nFor a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\nMexico City Restricts Airbnb Rentals to Curb \u2018Gentrification\u2019\nThe updated Copilot app will read users a summary of news, a feature called Copilot Daily, and, eventually, personalized reminders. Copilot Vision, which is in preview, can answer questions about text and images users are browsing online and offer guidance \u2014 such as suggesting how to furnish an apartment someone is considering purchasing.\nThe upgraded AI assistant, which starts rolling out Tuesday, works with iOS, Android, Windows and the web, and includes a new version for WhatsApp.\nThe vision tool requires customers to opt in. In preview, it\u2019s being tested with a limited list of popular web sites so Microsoft can collect data and ensure safety. The data also won\u2019t be stored or used for training, the company said, and the tool won\u2019t work with paywalled and \u201csensitive\u201d content in the preview.\nWhile Microsoft staked out an early lead in consumer AI owing to its investment in OpenAI, rivals Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are now rolling out AI services aimed at the millions of people who use Android and iOS mobile devices. Microsoft is shut out of that market, so its AI strategy relies heavily on Windows computers, notebooks and tablets.\nEarlier this year, the company teamed up with hardware makers to market a line of PCs specially designed to run artificial intelligence applications. So far, reaction to the machines \u2014 sold under the Copilot+ PC brand \u2014 has been mixed.\nIn an effort to generate some excitement, Microsoft on Tuesday also announced several new AI features for the devices.\nA photo-editing tool lets users enhance older or lower-quality images as well as fill in and erase parts of photos to make them easier to edit. A plain-English search lets users find documents and photos by describing them rather than having to know the file name, while a Click to Do feature brings up a menu of suggested steps or tasks based on what the customer is working on. The new Copilot app will also be available with a click on the Copilot+ PC\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI consumer chief, Mustafa Suleyman, has pledged to move beyond the utilitarian products the company has long been known for. In an interview, he talked about creating new interfaces and building \u201cexperiences that deeply empathize\u201d with users. He acknowledged that getting there will require changing the mindset inside Microsoft, not to mention building new business models.\n\u201cNow that we actually have these very conversational interfaces that give you a feeling \u2014 that focus on the emotional intelligence of the experience not just the utility \u2014 it requires us to exercise a totally new muscle in the organization,\u201d he said.\nSuleyman in a blog post explained his vision for Microsoft\u2019s AI future. \u201cWith your permission, Copilot will ultimately be able to act on your behalf, smoothing life\u2019s complexities and giving you more time to focus on what matters to you.
