        "Author": "  Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. has landed Microsoft Corp. as a customer for its made-to-order chip business, marking a key win for an ambitious turnaround effort under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBYD\u2019s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini\nJack Ma-Backed Ant Outbids Citadel Securities for Credit Suisse\u2019s China JV\nJacob Rothschild, Financier and Philanthropist, Dies at 87\nNorwegian Cruise Ship Halted at Mauritius Due to Outbreak\nMicrosoft plans to use Intel\u2019s 18A manufacturing technology to make a forthcoming chip that the software maker designed in-house, the two companies said at an event Wednesday. They didn\u2019t identify the product, but Microsoft recently announced plans for two homegrown chips: a computer processor and an artificial intelligence accelerator.\nIntel has been seeking to prove it can compete in the foundry market, where companies produce custom chips for clients. It\u2019s a major shift for the semiconductor pioneer, which once had the world\u2019s most advanced chipmaking facilities and kept them to itself. These days, Intel is racing to catch up with companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which leads the foundry industry.\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, is looking to secure a steady supply of semiconductors to power its data-center operations \u2014 especially as demand for AI grows. Designing its own chips also lets Microsoft fine-tune the products to its specific needs.\n\u201cWe need a reliable supply of the most advanced, high-performance and high-quality semiconductors,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are so excited to work with Intel.\u201d\nRead More: Microsoft Unveils Its First Custom-Designed AI, Cloud Chips\nThe broader industry has struggled to get enough advanced silicon \u2014 particularly Nvidia Corp.\u2019s highly prized accelerator chips, which help develop chatbots and other AI services.\nFor Intel, securing a large customer for its foundry business should help reassure investors that Gelsinger\u2019s comeback bid remains on track. His plan involves building out the chipmaker\u2019s factory operations to handle the increased load \u2014 a costly gamble \u2014 as well as restoring Intel\u2019s once-dominant technological prowess.\nThe company is looking to governments in the US and Europe to help defray the costs, and seeing Microsoft on board may help that effort. Intel has held talks with the Biden administration to secure more than $10 billion in subsidies under the Chips and Science Act, Bloomberg reported last week.\nMicrosoft and cloud-computing rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are among the largest buyers of advanced chips, which they use to power their data centers. They\u2019ve increasingly turned toward using their own designs \u2014 a trend that\u2019s hurt Intel in its most lucrative business. Acting as a foundry for Microsoft and others could help grab back at least a portion of that lost revenue.\nMost so-called chipmakers don\u2019t actually own plants and instead outsource their production, mainly to TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. Intel is far behind both companies in the foundry market, but it aims to at least overtake Samsung by the end of the decade. Last year, Intel had less than $1 billion of revenue from outsourcing, compared with almost $70 billion at TSMC, which has a market share of nearly 60%. Samsung has about 15% of the business, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nGelsinger also has promised that he will have the world\u2019s best production technology again by 2025 \u2014 a timeline that remains on track, the company said. Intel also has a new product that uses the 18A process, showing that the technology is ready for adoption by outside customers. And it announced an even more advanced approach called 14A.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company is also separating its design and product groups from Intel\u2019s manufacturing and process development arms. That\u2019s another major shift. Throughout most of Intel\u2019s 55-year history, the old arrangement had been touted as a key advantage: Designers worked closely with production teams to make sure that Intel\u2019s products got the best transistors in the industry.\nBut the new approach makes it easier to work with designers from outside customers. And it helps ensure that Intel doesn\u2019t favor its own production needs over those of clients, according to Stu Pann, who runs the foundry division.\nCustomer orders will be \u201csacrosanct,\u201d he said in an interview ahead of the event.\nPann said Intel will hold separate staff meetings and take all other steps required to keep its production teams at arm\u2019s length. And unlike manufacturers concentrated in East Asia, Intel will be able to offer customers a geographically diverse factory network, he said. That helps reduce the risk of supply chain snags.\n\u201cFrom our board on down, people understand what we\u2019re getting into,\u201d Pann said. \u201cThere is no going back. This is a zero tolerance business. The minute we make a visible mistake, we will burn the bridges we\u2019ve made.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America\nWhy Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First Place\nCan the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?\nHow Capital One\u2019s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect Consumers\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Microsoft (MSFT) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MSFT for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nMicrosoft's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Microsoft's main business drivers.\nMicrosoft Corporation is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. The company dominates the PC software market with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems.The company\u2019s Microsoft 365 application suite is one of the most popular productivity software globally. It is also one of the prominent public cloud providers that can deliver a wide variety of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions at scale.Redmond, WA-based Microsoft\u2019s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools and video games. Its software solutions and hardware devices are playing an important role in developing the metaverse.The company designs and sells PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Through Azure, it offers cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms and content.Microsoft reported revenues of $211.9 billion in fiscal 2023. The company reports operations under three segments: Productivity & Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing.Productivity & Business Processes accounted for 32.6% of fiscal 2023 revenues. The segment offers productivity and collaboration tools and services including Office 365, Dynamics business solutions, Teams, Relationship Sales solution, Power Platform and LinkedIn.Intelligent Cloud, which include Azure cloud services, contributed to 41.4% of fiscal 2023 revenues.In Jan, 2022, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard. The acquisition will accelerate the growth in Microsoft\u2019s gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through Oct 18, 2023 to allow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns.More Personal Computing represented 25.8% of fiscal 2023 revenues. The segment comprises mainly the Windows, Gaming (Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services), Devices (Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices) and Search (Bing and Microsoft Advertising) businesses.\nBottom Line\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Microsoft a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in February 2014 would be worth $11,326.86, or a gain of 1,032.69%, as of February 9, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 178.12% and gold's return of 54.15% over the same time frame.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for MSFT.\nMicrosoft\u2019s second-quarter results gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise. However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.\nShares have gained 7.66% over the past four weeks and there have been 15 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.\nWe now have 53,000 Azure AI customers, over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models of service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLM's from our partners like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral on Azure, without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models, but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device. Anker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM-5 for their applications. And we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter we added support for OpenAI's latest models including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3 as well as fine-tuning.\nWe are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups like Moveworks, Perplexity, SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation. For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how it's millions of customers\u2019 shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of $1 billion-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in Cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide.\nNow on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubishi and TomTom. KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB including its built-in native vector search capabilities along with Azure OpenAI service to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All-up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year and for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution.\nOpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT. And this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Milliman and PwC go from data to insights to action, all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake increased 46% quarter-over-quarter. Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI. GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by all-up platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs.\nAccenture alone will rollout GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year and we're going further making copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code no-code development helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data, and now build custom copilots. More than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom copilots. It is already being used by over 10,000 organizations including An Post, Holland America, PG&E.\nIn just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications. Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply-chain functions. And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales out Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. And with our new Copilot for service employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster.\nIt includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. With our industry and cross-industry clouds, we're tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems including Lifespan, UNC Health and UPMC to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation, to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. Now on to future of work. A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks.\nAnd overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees. And we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge. ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities. When it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration chat, meetings, and calling on one platform and Teams has also become a new entry point for us.\nMore than two-thirds of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms or Premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW, all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years, we're providing one-click access.\nWe also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year-over-year. And all-up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2 times year-over-year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now onto security. The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems, we reported a week and a half ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why last fall we announced a set of engineering priorities under our secure future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cyber security protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure.\nAnd it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture to help customers adopt a Zero Trust security architecture. Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIM Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape. And with Copilot for security, we're now helping hundreds of early access customers including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel, significantly increase their SecOps team's productivity. This quarter, we extended copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview. All-up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, JB Hunt, and the Mosaic Company.\nNow on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member sign-ups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge-sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year-over-year. Our new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs and engage with [indiscernible]. New AI features, including more personalized emails also continue to increase business ROI on the platform and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter.\nAnd more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum, earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to-date, both doubling quarter-over-quarter and both being an edge took share this quarter. We also introduced Copilot as a standalone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King.\nWith our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love where and when and how they want, hours streamed increased 44% year-over-year. Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio, I've never been more excited about our line-up of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox PC and Game Pass including Indiana Jones. And we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises, which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield.\nIn closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusted for the prior year's Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings, including AI services drove better-than-expected growth and large long-term Azure contracts.\nMicrosoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our office commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base. The strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%.\nAnd this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels [Technical Difficulty] Gaming console market was a bit smaller. As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share.\nThis impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.\nAt a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum.\nPaid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year-over-year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 355 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In our Talent Solutions business bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\nDynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business, primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency, with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses.\nOverall server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant-currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency, with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. Now, to more Personal Computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall. Growth includes 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\nWindows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance and higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant-currency, below expectations primarily [Technical Difficulty] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remains healthy. Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\nTotal gaming revenue was in line with expectations of stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year-over-year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge.\nOperating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.5 billion, lower-than-expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3. Cash paid-for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69% driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of cash paid-for property and equipment. This quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations, negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income.\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a US dollar basis. First FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point. And we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office Commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time.\nIn our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, driven by Microsoft's 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results.\nGrowth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in the enterprise and partner services revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services and more Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion, $15.1 billion or growth between 11% and 14%. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\nIn Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the low-double-digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-to-high single-digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low-to-mid 50s, driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expenses of $15.8 billion to $15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expenses should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses.\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full-year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the full-fiscal year. First FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full-year revenue growth by less than 1 point. We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full-year COGS or operating expense growth. Second Activision. For the full-year FY 2024, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income, when excluding purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related cost. At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1 and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2.\nOur commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year, even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. In closing, we are focused on execution. So our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Amy.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) saw a decent share price growth of 13% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading around its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at Microsoft\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nAccording to our valuation model, Microsoft seems to be fairly priced at around 8.3% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $443.45, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 50% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? MSFT\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIf you want to dive deeper into Microsoft, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "OpenAI launched its current version of ChatGPT in late 2022 and along with it came heightened investor interest in anything related to artificial intelligence (AI). Since then, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have emerged as two AI leaders, defining the category and its applications. Microsoft is a close partner of OpenAI, and Alphabet quickly revealed its answer to ChatGPT -- Bard -- shortly after ChatGPT was released.\nNearly a year after Microsoft unveiled its AI-infused Bing Chat and Alphabet launched Bard, the two companies reported earnings for the October-to-December quarter. Investors sold off both stocks on the news they reported, suggesting that the AI stock boom may be overdone. And yet, both companies delivered solid numbers.\nLet's dig into each company's recently released report and see which one is the better AI stock to buy today.\nMicrosoft recently took the title of the world's most valuable company from Apple, and the company's earnings show why. To be fair, the enterprise software company closed on its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October, so its results are getting a modest bump from the quarter a year ago.\nMicrosoft's fiscal 2024 second-quarter revenue rose 18% year over year to $62 billion, which topped analyst estimates at $61.14 billion. Its operating income jumped 33% year over year, or 25% on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis. On the bottom line, earnings per share (EPS) also rose 33% year over year, or 26% on a non-GAAP basis, to $2.93. That too came in ahead of estimates.\nMicrosoft's cloud was once again a bright spot for the company as its intelligent cloud segment grew 20% year over year with Azure revenue up 30%. Search and news advertising revenue growth was modest at 8% year over year, indicating that Bing Chat hasn't taken off the way the company hoped.\nMicrosoft finished the after-hours session down 0.3%.\nAlphabet delivered a solid fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter report overall as the company continues to recover from the slowdown in the digital ad market. Revenue rose 13% year over year to $86.3 billion, ahead of the consensus at $85.3 billion, but ad revenue of $65.5 billion was slightly below expectations, which helped drive the stock price down 6% in after-hours trading.\nThe weaker-than-expected ad-revenue growth seemed to indicate that Alphabet was losing ad-market share to competitors or that AI has yet to have a significant impact on ad spending.\nOn the bottom line, EPS surged from $1.05 to $1.64 due to a $2 billion improvement in equity securities. Operating income rose 30% to $23.7 billion.\nAd revenue rose 11% to $65.5 billion in part due to continued weakness in Google Network, where revenue declined again. Google Cloud, its other closely watched business segment, posted 26% growth to $9.2 billion, and it reported operating income of $864 million, up from a loss of $186 million in the quarter a year ago.\nBoth Microsoft and Alphabet saw strong stock-price appreciation last year, and each company reported similar growth on the top and bottom lines in the recent quarter. The difference between the two companies comes down to their AI strategies, and Microsoft appears to have the edge here.\nThe company introduced its AI-powered Copilot into a wide range of products, including the Office 365 suite, Github, Azure, and Bing. Microsoft management also said that AI drove six percentage points of revenue growth in Azure, pushing it from 24% growth to 30%, which is significant and likely to improve.\nFinally, compared to Alphabet, Microsoft seems to have been better prepared for the AI revolution as it made acquisitions like Github that fit well with its AI Copilot tools, and its investment in OpenAI has been a game-changer.\nAlphabet, on the other hand, acquired the AI research lab DeepMind several years ago but didn't integrate with Google Brain until last year. The Google parent has had the technology to roll out its own chatbot, but it let OpenAI and ChatGPT set the narrative with AI chat.\nAlphabet is no slouch in AI, but the Google parent lacks the strategy and applications to fully leverage the power of generative AI in the way that Microsoft has.\nMicrosoft, on the other hand, has planned for this moment and has taken smart risks, including allying with OpenAI. It also has a much more diversified product range compared to Alphabet, which makes most of its money from ads, a business that so far has not seemed to benefit significantly from AI.\nMicrosoft stock is more expensive than Alphabet, but it's the better AI stock to buy here. Its long-term prospects with the new technology still look considerably more promising.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has rewarded investors handsomely in the past year with impressive gains of 55%. Even better, the tech giant's latest results indicate that it could sustain its impressive rally going forward. What's sparked this heightened investor enthusiasm? Microsoft has a solid growth driver in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) pushing it higher.\nMicrosoft stock did see a dip in its stock price following the release of the company's fiscal 2024 second-quarter results on Jan. 30. It seems investors had some concern about an increase in its operating expenses. What those investors seemed to ignore however is that Microsoft's fiscal Q2 revenue jump was the fastest since 2022.\nLet's take a closer look at the factors that have led to an acceleration in Microsoft's growth and check how much upside this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock could deliver over the next three years.\nMicrosoft's fiscal Q2 revenue (for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023) was up 18% year over year to $62 billion. The company's non-GAAP net income increased at a faster pace of 33% from the prior-year period to $2.93 per share. The numbers were well ahead of consensus expectations of $2.77 per share in earnings on revenue of $61.1 billion.\nMicrosoft's cloud business played a key role in powering its growth last quarter. The company's Intelligent Cloud business segment, which includes revenue from the Azure cloud platform, increased 20% year over year to $25.9 billion. What's more, Microsoft's Azure cloud revenue increased an impressive 30% year over year, exceeding the 27.7% increase that Wall Street was looking for.\nMicrosoft management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that AI services accelerated Azure's growth by 6 percentage points last quarter. That was an improvement over the 3 percentage point increase seen in the first quarter of the fiscal year, and Microsoft claims that the integration of AI-focused services into its cloud offerings is helping it gain market share.\nCEO Satya Nadella said on the earnings call: \"We now have 53,000 Azure AI customers. Over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months.\" He pointed out that the Azure platform gives customers access to a wide range of large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), which they can use to run AI training and inference applications with the help of accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\nAs a result, multiple corporations are lining up to use Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service and the company is witnessing \"larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments.\" This explains why Microsoft's cloud business grew at a faster pace when compared to rivals.\nAlphabet's Google Cloud, for instance, saw a 26% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter. Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, saw a 13% year-over-year jump in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. This makes it clear that Microsoft is indeed gaining share in the lucrative cloud computing market.\nMordor Intelligence estimates that the size of the AI-based cloud computing market could grow from $67 billion in 2024 to $275 billion in 2029 at a compound annual rate of 32%. So, Microsoft's growing share of the cloud computing market should allow it to capitalize on this huge opportunity and boost its growth.\nAnalysts anticipate Microsoft will finish the current fiscal year with $244 billion in revenue, an increase of 15% over the previous year. That points toward a nice acceleration over the 7% revenue growth Microsoft delivered in fiscal 2023. More importantly, Microsoft is expected to sustain its healthy growth rate over the next couple of years as well.\nIf Microsoft's revenue indeed jumps to $319 billion at the end of fiscal 2026 and it maintains its current price-to-sales ratio of 13.5 at that time, its market cap could jump to just over $4.3 trillion. That points toward a 43% jump within the next three years.\nHowever, Microsoft could deliver stronger growth if it continues to capture a bigger share of the cloud computing market thanks to AI, which is why investors can still buy this AI stock even after the impressive returns it has clocked in the past year.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) continues to roll out more generative AI capabilities across its software offerings with the debut of its Copilot for Finance. The company says the AI service, which is launching as a public preview, will make it easier for workers to sort data and find errors in financial reports.\nMicrosoft has been adding its generative AI-powered Copilots to a slew of its business offerings ranging from Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Copilot for Sales to Copilot for Service. That\u2019s in addition to the company\u2019s Copilot in Windows 11, which is built into all Windows 11 PCs running the latest software updates.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot for Finance, the company says, can provide real-time insights into corporate finance data, cutting down on the rigamarole of having to enter and search through seemingly endless rows and columns in Excel.\nThe tech giant says its latest Copilot can also streamline audits, detect data variances, and help users generate PowerPoint presentations and emails based on available financial information using natural language prompts.\nThe Windows maker isn\u2019t revealing pricing for Copilot for Finance, but the service includes the company\u2019s Copilot for Microsoft 365, which adds generative AI capabilities to the Microsoft 365 productivity suite. That platform traditionally costs $30 per user per month.\nMicrosoft is putting an enormous amount of effort into ensuring it has a Copilot for each of its productivity platforms as it races to out-innovate rivals, including Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Salesforce (CRM). Both of those companies, as well as a slew of other smaller firms, are also building generative AI services for their enterprise products to prove to customers that they\u2019re on the bleeding edge of today\u2019s hottest tech trend.\nLast week, Google debuted its Gemini Business, a $20-per-month add-on for its Gemini for Workspace productivity suite. The company also offers Gemini Enterprise, a $30-per-month add-on for Gemini for Workspace with enhanced features for meeting summaries and transcriptions.\nThe push to bring generative AI tools to more enterprise-friendly services comes as Microsoft and its rivals seek to further monetize their enormous investments in generative AI technologies in recent years.\nMicrosoft has already invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and is lined up to invest billions more throughout the next decade. On Tuesday, the company also disclosed it is working with OpenAI rival Mistral and will begin offering that firm\u2019s AI models via its Azure cloud platform.\nIn its most recent earnings report, Microsoft revealed that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, up from 3% in the prior quarter. Shares of the tech juggernaut are up 63% over the last 12 months.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

That trajectory would see the market hit close to $2 trillion before the end of the decade.\nAs a result, excitement over AI triggered countless tech stocks to soar over the last year. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been one of the biggest winners, with its shares up 56% in the last 12 months. The company is one of OpenAI's largest investors, a position that affords Microsoft with exclusive access to some of the start-up's most advanced AI models.\nThe Windows company is an exciting way to invest in AI. However, companies at slightly earlier stages in their AI ventures could have more room to run over the long term. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options. One is carving out a lucrative role in the AI chip market, while the other is leading in the software side of the industry.\nMicrosoft's earnings could hit just under $16 per share over the next two fiscal years, while AMD's and Amazon's may reach about $7 per share. On the surface, Microsoft looks like a no-brainer.\nHowever, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Microsoft at 35, AMD at 52, and Amazon at 41) would yield stock prices of $546 for Microsoft, $346 for AMD, and $283 for Amazon. Considering their current positions, these projections would see Microsoft's stock rise 35%, AMD's 99%, and Amazon's 66% by fiscal 2026.\nThese estimates show that AMD and Amazon have significantly more growth potential over the next two years. So forget Microsoft. Here are two AI stocks to buy instead.\nAMD's stock has climbed 111% year to date alongside its growing prospects in AI. The tech company is gearing up to challenge AI's leading chip supplier Nvidia\u00a0with a new line of graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the hardware necessary for training AI models.\nLast December, AMD unveiled its new MI300X AI GPUs, designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings. They've already caught the eye of some of the industry's biggest players.\nIn November 2023, Microsoft announced Azure would become the first cloud platform to implement AMD's new GPU to optimize its AI capabilities. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has similarly signed on to use AMD's MI300X chips. \nHowever, AMD isn't banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs. AMD is seeking to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled.\nAMD supplies chips to PC and notebook manufacturers across tech, with a 23% market share in laptop central processing units (CPUs). Consequently, AMD could significantly profit from increased demand for AI-equipped PCs, carving out its own niche in the burgeoning AI market.\nAs the biggest name in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon has multiple use cases for AI and ways to bolster its business with the technology.\nSince the start of 2023, Amazon responded to the rising demand for AI by expanding its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In September, the company debuted Bedrock, a tool offering a range of models that customers can use to build generative AI applications.\nAWS also introduced CodeWhisperer, a platform that generates code for developers, and HealthScribe, a feature capable of transcribing patient-to-physician conversations. \nIn addition to improved cloud capabilities, AI could help Amazon better track shopping trends and effectively recommend products to customers on its retail site. Meanwhile, the company recently announced an AI shopping assistant called Rufus that will improve the customer experience.\nAmazon is on a promising growth path in AI and has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and keep up with the competition. Over the last 12 months, the tech company's free cash flow has risen by 904% to $32 billion.\nIn Amazon's fourth quarter, revenue increased 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating analyst estimates by nearly $4 billion. Its earnings per share hit $1, compared to expectations of $0.80.\nAmazon is in steep competition with Microsoft in the cloud market, with both ramping up their AI expansions. However, Amazon's leading market share in the industry potentially gives it a leg up. \nAlongside massive growth potential in its earnings per share, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer buy over Microsoft's for anyone looking to invest in AI. \nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "Intel signs Microsoft as foundry customer, says on track to overtake TSMC",
        "Author": "  Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney ",
        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n(Reuters) -Intel said on Wednesday that Microsoft plans to use its services to manufacture a custom computing chip and that the company expects to beat an internal deadline of 2025 to overtake its biggest rival, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, in advanced chip manufacturing.\nThe American chipmaker also gave new details on how it plans to maintain a lead over TSMC into 2026 and beyond.\nIntel made the disclosures at an event in San Jose, California, at the first technology conference for Intel Foundry, the contract manufacturing operation it established to compete with TSMC.\nIntel says it plans to retake the mantle of making the world's fastest chips from TSMC later this year with what it calls Intel 18A manufacturing technology and extend that lead into 2026 with new technology called Intel 14A.\nIt said Microsoft will use its 18A technology to make an undisclosed chip and that it now expects $15 billion of foundry orders, up from the $10 billion that the company had earlier told investors to expect.\nTSMC said it had \"no comment on the competitiveness of our advanced technologies\" beyond what its CEO C.C. Wei said at the company's last investor conference in January.\nTSMC's Taipei-listed stock has jumped almost 17% so far this year due to its dominance in producing the kinds of advanced chips used in AI applications by companies like Nvidia.\nThe news of 14A technology is the first time the Silicon Valley company has given details of its plans beyond 2025. That is the deadline Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, had set to regain the chipmaking crown when he took the reins three years ago.\nFor decades, Intel made chips only for itself and used its lead in manufacturing to create a cycle in which it made chips with industry-leading performance and charged a premium for them. Those margins, in turn, helped fund manufacturing advances. But when Intel lost its manufacturing lead, its chips became less competitive and margins slipped, sapping the source funding for a manufacturing rebound.\nNow, Intel is counting on potentially billions of dollars in U.S. government subsidies and business from outside customers to help it get back on track.\nIt is hoping some customers will be enticed by its long history of operating cutting-edge factories on multiple continents, especially those with concerns about TSMC's practice of keeping its most advanced factories clustered in Taiwan.\n\"It's a sales pitch that's resonating right now. People want that,\" Stu Pann, the executive overseeing Intel Foundry, said of the company's geographic diversity.\nIntel says it has four \"large\" customers signed up for its 18A manufacturing technology but has yet to name them. It is not clear if Microsoft is among those financially important customers.\nIntel said on Wednesday it was partnering with Arm Holdings to make it easier to make chips with Arm technologies in its factories. Intel also said it will work with the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan to allow students to access its 18A manufacturing technology.\nIntel also has a special technology that analysts say will be useful for speeding up power-hungry artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia, the leader in the AI chip market, has said it is evaluating Intel's manufacturing technology, but the two companies have not announced a deal.\nIntel's effort to lure in outside customers \"is the key to the turnaround story,\" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of consulting firm Creative Strategies.\n\"Unfortunately, it's an unanswered question, because this is a two-to-three-year journey before we have any inkling of knowing that this is working.\"\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max A.

        "Text": "Thursday, February 8, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Toyota Motor Corporation (TM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Microsoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +54.0%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues have been driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.Productivity and Business Processes revenues continues to increase due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.However, More Personal Computing revenues are suffering from continued weakness in Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. Also, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Exxon Mobil have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-7.5% vs. -3.5%). The company is lagging its peers when it comes to shareholders\u2019 returns. The energy giant\u2019s financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the coronavirus pandemic. Also, high input cost is hurting refining operations.Nevertheless, ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. In Stabroek Block, located offshore Guyana, ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook.The advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe. ExxonMobil\u2019s deal to acquire Pioneer Natural will bolster its presence in the prolific Permian Basin.(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)Toyota Motor\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+56.5% vs. +38.2%). The company\u2019s continued demand for vehicles and a robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles are set to fuel Toyota\u2019s sales volumes.The Japanese auto giant aims to generate 40% of its global sales from electric vehicles by 2025 and 70% by 2030. It plans to invest 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) for a lineup of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. For fiscal 2024, Toyota projects vehicle sales of 9.6 million units, indicating an increase from 8.82 million units sold in fiscal 2023. Its investor-friendly moves also spark optimism.However, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on the company\u2019s margins. High capex and R&D expenses on the development of electric and autonomous vehicles are likely to dent its near-term margins and cash flows. The stock warrants a cautious stance at present.(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include GSK plc (GSK), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

        "Text": "Microsoft's prescient bets and aggressive investments in AI have propelled the software giant to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. Yet Satya Nadella, its typically reserved chief executive, couldn\u2019t resist landing a gloved jab at the rest of the industry.\n\"We have the best model today ... even with all the hoopla, one year after, GPT4 is better,\" Nadella said at a company event in Mumbai on Wednesday. \"We are waiting for the competition to arrive. It will arrive, I'm sure, but the fact [is] that we have the ... leading LLM out there.\"\nNadella\u2019s rare bit of reality-check came as he pitched Microsoft\u2019s increasingly powerful lineup of AI offerings to the leaders of some of India\u2019s largest companies. In a 35-minute keynote address, Nadella implored businesses to begin exploring ways to deploy AI to boost productivity and refine their products, while urging them not to fall behind.\nThe Microsoft executive urged India to ramp up its efforts and focus on AI. \"This new capability, AI, is going to have an impact on GDP,\" he said.\nNadella at Microsoft's Mumbai event on Wednesday. Image Credits: Microsoft\nBorn in India, Nadella said the South Asian nation has already become the second largest talent base for AI developers on GitHub. Puneet Chandok, who quit a top role at AWS India last year to join Microsoft to lead the company's India and South Asia business, added: \"India is not just incredible anymore. We are credible as well. India is starting to dream big, and going after this dream like our lives depend on it.\"\nThe company also announced that it will offer AI skilling opportunities to 2 million Indians in smaller cities and towns by next year. \"I hope consensus emerges and that is what really helps, in some sense, (with) the diffusion of this technology,\" he said of the socio-economic progress.\n\"This is first time I feel what is happening in India and the rest of the world there is no gap. If anything, the use cases here are so unique and paving their own path,\" Nadella added.\nOne such unique offering, Nadella later highlighted, is Karya, an \"ethical data company\" that creates datasets in multiple Indian languages to train AI models while providing jobs and education to people in rural areas.\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/microsoft-ceo-nadella-on-ai-llm-race-we-are-waiting-for-competition-to-arrive/\n"

It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.\nWe now have 53,000 Azure AI customers, over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models of service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLM's from our partners like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral on Azure, without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models, but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device. Anker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM-5 for their applications. And we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter we added support for OpenAI's latest models including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3 as well as fine-tuning.\nWe are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups like Moveworks, Perplexity, SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation. For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how it's millions of customers\u2019 shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of $1 billion-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in Cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide.\nNow on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubishi and TomTom. KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB including its built-in native vector search capabilities along with Azure OpenAI service to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All-up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year and for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution.\nOpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT. And this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Milliman and PwC go from data to insights to action, all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake increased 46% quarter-over-quarter. Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI. GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by all-up platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs.\nAccenture alone will rollout GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year and we're going further making copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code no-code development helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data, and now build custom copilots. More than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom copilots. It is already being used by over 10,000 organizations including An Post, Holland America, PG&E.\nIn just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications. Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply-chain functions. And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales out Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. And with our new Copilot for service employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster.\nIt includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. With our industry and cross-industry clouds, we're tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems including Lifespan, UNC Health and UPMC to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation, to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. Now on to future of work. A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks.\nAnd overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees. And we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge. ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities. When it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration chat, meetings, and calling on one platform and Teams has also become a new entry point for us.\nMore than two-thirds of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms or Premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW, all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years, we're providing one-click access.\nWe also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year-over-year. And all-up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2 times year-over-year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now onto security. The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems, we reported a week and a half ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why last fall we announced a set of engineering priorities under our secure future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cyber security protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure.\nAnd it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture to help customers adopt a Zero Trust security architecture. Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIM Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape. And with Copilot for security, we're now helping hundreds of early access customers including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel, significantly increase their SecOps team's productivity. This quarter, we extended copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview. All-up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, JB Hunt, and the Mosaic Company.\nNow on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member sign-ups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge-sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year-over-year. Our new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs and engage with [indiscernible]. New AI features, including more personalized emails also continue to increase business ROI on the platform and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter.\nAnd more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum, earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to-date, both doubling quarter-over-quarter and both being an edge took share this quarter. We also introduced Copilot as a standalone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King.\nWith our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love where and when and how they want, hours streamed increased 44% year-over-year. Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio, I've never been more excited about our line-up of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox PC and Game Pass including Indiana Jones. And we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises, which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield.\nIn closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusted for the prior year's Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings, including AI services drove better-than-expected growth and large long-term Azure contracts.\nMicrosoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our office commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base. The strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%.\nAnd this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels [Technical Difficulty] Gaming console market was a bit smaller. As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share.\nThis impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.\nAt a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum.\nPaid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year-over-year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 355 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In our Talent Solutions business bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\nDynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business, primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency, with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses.\nOverall server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant-currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency, with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. Now, to more Personal Computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall. Growth includes 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\nWindows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance and higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant-currency, below expectations primarily [Technical Difficulty] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remains healthy. Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\nTotal gaming revenue was in line with expectations of stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year-over-year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge.\nOperating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.5 billion, lower-than-expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3. Cash paid-for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69% driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of cash paid-for property and equipment. This quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations, negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income.\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a US dollar basis. First FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point. And we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office Commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time.\nIn our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, driven by Microsoft's 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results.\nGrowth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in the enterprise and partner services revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services and more Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion, $15.1 billion or growth between 11% and 14%. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\nIn Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the low-double-digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-to-high single-digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low-to-mid 50s, driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expenses of $15.8 billion to $15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expenses should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses.\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full-year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the full-fiscal year. First FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full-year revenue growth by less than 1 point. We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full-year COGS or operating expense growth. Second Activision. For the full-year FY 2024, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income, when excluding purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related cost. At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1 and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2.\nOur commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year, even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. In closing, we are focused on execution. So our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request the participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.

Xbox is rolling out a handful of its previously Xbox exclusive games to Sony's PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch. Microsoft's Xbox CEO Phil Spencer saying on a podcast Thursday, the console maker will also release four exclusive video game titles on external platforms.\nFor more on what this means for Microsoft's growth strategy. I'm joined by Lewis Ward, IDC gaming esports and VR and AR research director alongside our very own tech editor Dan Howley. Good to talk to you today Lewis. We've heard Phil Spencer say in the past, this new strategy about making sure that every screen is an Xbox. How does this announcement fit into that vision?\nLEWIS WARD: Thanks for having me. So yeah, it's true that Microsoft has been emphasizing the software and the capabilities of offering games on pretty much every screen that consumers have for several years now. So this is an extension of a strategy that's been out there for many years and obviously they want the best experience to be on Xbox console hardware.\nAnd then they've pushed into PCs to a significant extent over the past few years. And then mobile is more aspirational. But something they clearly view as a growth opportunity outside of most developed economies is going to be, can we put those same games in the cloud and offer it on iOS and Android devices that people have counted in the billions worldwide?\nDANIEL HOWLEY: But Lewis, I want to ask, when it comes to Microsoft, their console sales are slower than the PlayStation 5. I think the estimate was take-two, it said there were 77, 9th generation consoles sold the Xbox Series S and X and the PlayStation 5. And Sony recently said that they sold 50 million PlayStation 5. So I guess that leaves 27 million Xbox units.\nSo almost 2 to 1 difference. What does it mean now that they're thinking of taking these or they are taking these first party titles to other devices. We heard Phil Spencer say that they're sticking with the hardware strategy. But it seems increasingly like they're moving to a software focused side of things.\nLEWIS WARD: absolutely. So the four titles are not like the crown jewels, it's not halo, it's not gears of war or Forza. It seems to be sea of thieves, a live service game, grounded was another one that appears to be, I don't think they've finally released the titles. But that's certainly the online speculation.\nAnd yes, I think there was a large share of Xbox players who were concerned that a lot of the crown jewels of the Xbox Game Studios are going to be eventually playable on PlayStation 5 and so that was the thing that really caused a lot of consternation, let's say among the Xbox fan base.\nBut Phil Spencer and company really tamp that down yesterday by saying, no this is a limited approach that we're taking with four specific games, that are a few years old at least. They are successful games, very high Metacritic ratings and so the idea is to basically monetize a sunk investment at this point.\nAnd if they put it on PS5 and switch it sounds like they're going to go to both all four games, are going to go on both by the end of this year. It's going to be a few, I don't know, several million dollars coming into the Xbox ecosystem from a revenue angle and hopefully grow some more fans even on competitor's hardware as it were. So I think that's the plan, the vision.\nDANIEL HOWLEY: I guess what does it say then that people were nervous that Microsoft was just going to move out of the hardware business. I guess, it gives the feeling that there's a sense that there's a lack of security for Xbox.\nLEWIS WARD: and I mean, I guess there was a leak or something, a week or two ago that hinted that it could be much more than what was ultimately announced yesterday and presumably, it's plausible that some games we don't know about will follow the same trajectory. I might add that Minecraft is a hugely successful game for Microsoft. That's on every platform under the sun and no one seems to particularly care about it.\nBut yeah, at the end of the day, there has been significant concern that perhaps they're even going to get out of the hardware business or that again, some of their real mainstay franchises first party stuff are going to show up on other console platforms.\nAnd in effect as far as I'm concerned, Phil Spencer and company Matt Booty, Sarah Bond basically said that is not going to happen for the foreseeable future, at least. So to my mind, the podcast interview really should have assuaged a lot of the concerns that were expressed by Xbox gamers that expressed concerns that that might happen.\n"

It's going to be a few, I don't know, several million dollars coming into the Xbox ecosystem from a revenue angle and hopefully grow some more fans even on competitor's hardware as it were. So I think that's the plan, the vision.\nDANIEL HOWLEY: I guess what does it say then that people were nervous that Microsoft was just going to move out of the hardware business. I guess, it gives the feeling that there's a sense that there's a lack of security for Xbox.\nLEWIS WARD: and I mean, I guess there was a leak or something, a week or two ago that hinted that it could be much more than what was ultimately announced yesterday and presumably, it's plausible that some games we don't know about will follow the same trajectory. I might add that Minecraft is a hugely successful game for Microsoft. That's on every platform under the sun and no one seems to particularly care about it.\nBut yeah, at the end of the day, there has been significant concern that perhaps they're even going to get out of the hardware business or that again, some of their real mainstay franchises first party stuff are going to show up on other console platforms.\nAnd in effect as far as I'm concerned, Phil Spencer and company Matt Booty, Sarah Bond basically said that is not going to happen for the foreseeable future, at least. So to my mind, the podcast interview really should have assuaged a lot of the concerns that were expressed by Xbox gamers that expressed concerns that that might happen.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., racing to add more artificial intelligence capabilities, is nearing the completion of a critical new software tool for app developers that would step up competition with Microsoft Corp.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade\nLargest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions\nCapital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal \nStocks Fall Before Nvidia\u2019s Must-Watch Earnings: Markets Wrap\nUS Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\nThe company has been working on the tool for the last year as part of the next major version of Xcode, Apple\u2019s flagship programming software. It has now expanded testing of the features internally and has ramped up development ahead of a plan to release it to third-party software makers as early as this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nThe new system will operate similarly to Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot and use artificial intelligence to predict and complete blocks of code, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. That simplifies the programming process for software development, potentially saving time and money.\nApple is also exploring the use of AI to generate code for testing applications, an often tedious process. Currently, Apple is pushing some engineers to try these new AI features internally as part of a \u201cdogfooding\u201d effort \u2014 when a company uses its own products \u2014 to make sure they work properly before releasing them to outside developers.\nThe moves are part of a broader push into generative AI and large language models, the technology behind popular chatbots like ChatGPT. Apple is playing catch-up with tech peers in this burgeoning market, but has promised to discuss its plans for AI later this year. That announcement could come as soon as June, when the company holds its annual developers conference.\nApple shares, which had been down as much as 1.5%, briefly turned positive on the news. They were little changed at the close Thursday, trading at $183.86. Microsoft fell less than 1% to $406.56.\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the plans.\nIt\u2019s been an urgent undertaking. Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, has told his teams to develop as many new AI features as possible for this year\u2019s operating system updates.\nHe\u2019s also tasked his lieutenants with drumming up features that use the technology and has made top deputy Sebastien Marineau-Mes a point person for the effort. Apple executives demonstrated the AI functions to the board late last year, with Marineau-Mes conducting much of the presentation, the people said. The Xcode work is being overseen by another Federighi lieutenant, longtime software engineering vice president Andreas Wendker.\nRead More: Inside Apple\u2019s Big Plan to Bring Generative AI to All Its Devices\nApple\u2019s next iPhone and iPad software updates \u2014 iOS and iPadOS 18 \u2014 will include a slew of new AI features, according to the people. The company is planning to tout the software, codenamed Crystal, as one of the most significant updates in the 16-year history of the iPhone.\nIt\u2019s also planning to bring some AI features to the next version of macOS, codenamed Glow. Still, Apple aims to take a gradual approach to AI development, with some enhancements not coming for years.\nThe company has explored other new AI features, including ones that would automate the creation of Apple Music playlists and make slideshows in its PowerPoint rival Keynote. Another feature under consideration is a revamped version of Spotlight, Apple\u2019s systemwide search feature.\nThe new version would be able to toggle between specific features within apps and answer complex questions based on data trained from large language models. LLMs, the technology that powers AI tools, is developed by bombarding software with a torrent of data.\nEarly designs of the Spotlight overhaul include using LLMs to answer more complex questions and the ability to tap deeper into apps to launch specific functions. The current version of Spotlight is mostly limited to launching apps, making basic web searches and pulling up information like the weather and sports scores.\nRead More: Apple Tests \u2018Apple GPT,\u2019 Develops Generative AI Tools to Catch OpenAI\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive officer, said during his latest quarterly conference call that engineers \u201ccontinue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort\u201d on the initiative.\nThe competition is mounting. In January, Samsung Electronics Co. launched a new Galaxy S24 smartphone line that weaves in Google AI features \u2014 offering a preview of sorts to what Apple is expected to do with the iPhone 16 later this year.\nThe company has also continued to hone its own LLMs to enhance Siri and services like AppleCare support. The company is looking to improve Siri\u2019s ability to answer complex questions accurately, and the customer service teams are trying to speed up chat and phone support. Apple is also heavily invested in integrating AI into its health features.\n(Updates with share trading in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures\nPursuing \u2018American Dynamism,\u2019 Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC\nThe Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force\nHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars\nHow Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-02-19, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $292.58. It's currently trading at a price of $404.055. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -38.1%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.07\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.28%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 17.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n153.46\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n139.12\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n292.58\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $175.45. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -130.3%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Microsoft by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock surged 16% to a new all-time high on Feb. 22 after the chipmaker's latest earnings report crushed Wall Street's expectations. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on Jan. 28, its revenue surged 265% year over year to $22.1 billion and surpassed analysts' expectations by $1.6 billion. Its adjusted earnings soared 486% to $5.16 per share and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.52.\nFor the full year, Nvidia's revenue jumped 126% to $60.9 billion as its adjusted EPS climbed 288%. That represented a stunning acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% decline in adjusted earnings in fiscal 2023.\nNvidia's 280% rally over the past 12 months has propelled its market cap to $1.96 trillion, making it the world's third-most-valuable company after Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which is worth $3.06 trillion, and Apple, which is worth $2.85 trillion. So does Nvidia have a realistic shot at surpassing Apple and stealing the crown from Microsoft by 2025?\nNvidia's recent growth spurt was entirely driven by the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Nvidia's top-tier data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks more efficiently than stand-alone CPUs, and companies scrambled to purchase those chips to keep pace with the growth of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nAll of the world's leading AI-oriented companies -- including OpenAI, its top backer Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet's Google, and Meta Platforms -- use Nvidia's GPUs. Its GPU sales to China were throttled by export curbs over the past year, but the market's demand is still outstripping its supply by a significant margin.\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center chips in fiscal 2024, compared to just 56% of its revenue in fiscal 2023. That rapid expansion curbed its dependence on gaming GPUs, which previously generated most of its revenue but were highly exposed to the PC market's post-pandemic slowdown and the volatile crypto mining market.\nThe bulls believe Nvidia will continue to dominate the AI market, even as its rival AMD enters the ring with its cheaper data center GPUs, and cloud giants like Meta and Google start developing their own first-party AI GPUs. Based on those rosy expectations, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 as its EPS rises at a CAGR of 37%.\nNvidia's stock isn't cheap at 35 times forward earnings and 18 times this year's sales, but it seems reasonably valued relative to its growth rates. If it maintains those valuations, meets analysts' expectations, and still trades at 35 times forward earnings by the beginning of fiscal 2027 (which starts in Jan. 2026), its stock might be worth $1,085 per share with a market cap of about $2.7 trillion by late 2025. That would represent a near-40% gain from its current levels.\nWe should take those hazy long-term estimates with a grain of salt, since Nvidia repeatedly beat analysts' expectations over the past year, but they imply the chipmaker probably won't be more valuable than Microsoft by 2025.\nMicrosoft has also tapped into the AI market's explosive growth via its big investment in OpenAI and the integration of its generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise at a CAGR of 15% and 17%, respectively, from fiscal 2023 (which ended last June) to fiscal 2026.\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft also trades at 35 times forward earnings. If it maintains that premium multiple and matches Wall Street's expectations, it could trade at about $550 with a market cap of $4.1 trillion by early 2026.\nSimply put, Nvidia won't catch up to Microsoft unless the bulls abruptly bid its valuations to unsustainable levels or Microsoft drops the ball and gets revalued as a slower-growth company.\nInstead of wondering if either of those scenarios will happen, investors should focus on Nvidia's growth potential instead of its market capitalization. It's still selling picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, and it could still have plenty of room to run before longer-term headwinds like AMD's GPUs or first-party chips meaningfully affect its growth.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n153.46\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n139.12\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n292.58\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $175.45. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -130.3%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Microsoft's Xbox is bringing games to rival PlayStation 5 and Switch consoles",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Xbox is spreading the wealth by rolling out a handful of its previously Xbox-exclusive games to Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation and Nintendo\u2019s (NTDOY) Switch. The announcement came in the form of a podcast hosted by Xbox chief Phil Spencer, Xbox president Sarah Bond, and Xbox studio head Matt Booty.\nDuring the announcement, Spencer said Microsoft will be bringing four titles to other consoles, though he stopped short of giving the names of the games, saying that he wanted to leave it to the individual developer studios to announce them.\nHe did, however, say that two of the games are over a year old, community-driven, and franchises that have reached their peak on Xbox and PC. The other two games are smaller games that were never really built to be platform exclusive.\nSpencer also said that neither Xbox's upcoming \"Indiana Jones\" game nor the existing \"Starfield\" will be going to other consoles.\nThe idea of moving first-party Xbox titles to other platforms riled up Xbox fans, who feared that it would be a death knell for Microsoft's gaming franchise. But according to Spencer, that's not the case.\n\"[This is] not a change to fundamental exclusive strategy. [We're] making these decisions for some specific reasons. Every decision with the long-term health of Xbox in mind,\" Spencer said.\nImportantly, Booty said that Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass gaming subscription service will not be going to other consoles. And according to Bond, Game Pass is getting an upgrade with the addition of Activision Blizzard games, starting with \"Diablo IV.\"\nFirst-party console exclusives have been a staple of the gaming industry for decades and serve as a lure for console makers to draw potential customers to their boxes. Sony has a long history of successful first-party titles, including the \u201cGod of War,\u201d \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d \u201cUncharted,\u201d and the \u201cHorizon\u201d series, while Nintendo has its \u201cSuper Mario Bros.,\u201d \u201cZelda,\u201d \u201cMetroid,\u201d and \u201cMario Kart\u201d series.\nMicrosoft also offers its fair share of first-party titles, including \u201cHalo,\u201d \u201cForza,\u201d and \u201cGears of War,\u201d but they aren\u2019t the kind of console movers that Sony and Nintendo have on deck. As a result, the Xbox has generally been locked in third place in terms of sales behind Sony and Nintendo.\nIn its latest earnings release, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) said Sony and Microsoft sold 77 million so-called \u201c9th generation\u201d consoles, the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, as of Dec. 31, 2023. While Microsoft doesn\u2019t provide console sales figures, Sony does.\nIn the company\u2019s latest earnings, Sony said it sold 50 million PlayStation 5 consoles from its launch in 2020 through Dec. 31, 2023. That leaves Microsoft, which launched the Xbox in 2020, with roughly 27 million units sold. Nintendo, meanwhile, has sold a staggering 139 million Switch consoles since it debuted in 2017.\nSpencer, however, doesn't seem concerned about games' exclusivity, saying it's a shrinking trend.\n\"Over the next five to 10 years, exclusive games are going to be a smaller and smaller part of the games industry,\" he said.\nMicrosoft\u2019s gaming division has become a juggernaut since its $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard sent the business soaring. In its most recent quarter, the tech giant reported total revenue of $62 billion. Some $23.9 billion came from Microsoft\u2019s server products and cloud services, while $13.5 billion came from Office products and cloud services.\nRoughly $7 billion came from gaming, while $5 billion came from its Windows products.\nAnd although Microsoft hasn't been as successful in terms of its collection of first-party titles, it has done exceptionally well with its Game Pass service. According to the company's latest numbers, 34 million games across PC and Xbox subscribe to Game Pass, which costs $9.99 for the standard version and $16.99 for the Ultimate version.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -Microsoft is developing a new network card that could improve the performance of its Maia AI server chip and potentially reduce the company's reliance on chip designer Nvidia, The Information reported on Tuesday.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has tapped Pradeep Sindhu, who co-founded networking gear developer Juniper Networks, to spearhead the network card effort, the report said citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft acquired Sindhu's server chip startup, Fungible, last year.\nThe new network card is similar to Nvidia's ConnectX-7 card, which the chip developer sells alongside its graphic processor units (GPUs), the report added.\nThe equipment could take more than a year to develop and, if successful, could lessen the time it takes for OpenAI to train its models on Microsoft servers as well as make the process less expensive, according to the report.\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nMicrosoft has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and has incorporated its technology in a wide variety of products, giving the Windows-maker a leg up in the race to sell artificial-intelligence software.\nThe company had introduced Maia, a chip meant to run large language models and support AI computing, in November.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\n"

Since taking over as chief executive, the company's stock has risen over 1,200%, from around $30 to over $400 per share, achieving a market cap of over $3 trillion.\nYahoo Finance Anchors Rachelle Akuffo and Akiko Fujita break down Nadella's accomplishments and all the innovations he has made with the company, including overseeing the Activision-Blizzard acquisition and major investments in AI.\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: All right. What a way to mark a 10-year anniversary as CEO. When Microsoft's Satya Nadella started his role at Microsoft, the stock was around $30, now sitting at over $400. And of course, surpassing Apple as the most valuable company, thanks to its early lead with generative AI.\nAnd Akiko, when you think of what's happened under his tenure here, I mean, including things like supercharging their intelligent Cloud business to generate almost $90 billion in the last fiscal year, it really was something that a lot of us couldn't have predicted. I'm sure if you gave a lot of people $1,000 10 years ago, and they had to pick between Microsoft and say Apple, their bet probably would have been on Apple. But then of course, enter their supercharging of the Cloud and of course, generative AI as well.\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, it's worth going back to 2014, Rochelle. Because Satya Nadella followed Steve Ballmer, who you could argue was a much flashier CEO. And there are questions about who Satya Nadella was, whether, in fact, he could take this company and really supercharge it, as you've said. $300 billion is what the market cap was when he took over. Today, we're talking about a $3 trillion company, and he doubled down on the Cloud, right, to start with.\nAnd you had plenty of analysts who said, well, that's not necessarily the right focus. But today, we're talking about a leader in Cloud, in artificial intelligence, all under Satya Nadella's watch. Also been interesting to see some of the acquisition strategy here under his tenure. LinkedIn, Activision Blizzard, the two big ones, but there's certainly been many more. And look, Microsoft, at least right now, the most valuable company looking at a $3 trillion market cap. So been a certainly very productive 10 years for Satya Nadella.\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, when you think of the legacy he's going to leave, especially getting out in front with OpenAI, and generative AI here, I mean, he certainly left his mark here. This, I would consider this that, his iPhone moment. It's a game changer.\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. And it all started with him focusing on the Cloud first, right? I mean, that really changed the trajectory for Microsoft. But again, focusing on this because Satya Nadella just marked 10 years as CEO of Microsoft.\n"

Dan.\nDAN HOWLEY: That's right, Microsoft, OpenAI, basically saying that there are groups that are using different forms of large language models and AI, even ChatGPT, to help them kind of hack into enemy nations, the nations that they see as enemies, as well as other groups, NGOs, organizations, Microsoft, probably.\nAnd so, some of the ways in which they're doing this is by using these chat bots, again, ChatGPT being one of them, to look up things like satellite capabilities, radar technologies, reconnaissance information, ways of scripting tasks, improving social engineering for phishing and spear phishing emails.\nAnd you can see here we have China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, those are the countries that were named in this report. And they have different groups with fun little names like Charcoal Typhoon and Salmon Typhoon. And I think one is Emerald Sheet, that's out of North Korea. So the names sound really cool. But I think it's interesting to point out that we constantly talk about how AI is going to help when it comes to things like business practices or even some consumer applications. But any time there's new technology, hackers are obviously going to look at it as well. And so, that's what's happening here.\nAnd regardless of how much we see an advance of technology in the positive for companies that are defending themselves, cybersecurity specialists, the attackers are always going to be one step ahead. That's just the nature of this game. And so, it's the same way here. There's potential that maybe I can help level that playing field a little bit, but in all likelihood, hackers are going to figure out a way to get around that and continue to stay ahead.\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, so that's one of the negatives of AI. And this headline caught my attention too. SEC Gary Gensler was saying that investors should be aware of AI washing because we've seen a lot of activity in those stocks that even mentioned AI on their earnings calls. I wanted to get your take on that because I know you cover the space closely. Obviously, AI seems to be the buzzword right now. What do you make of the SEC now saying, look, you got to be careful?\nDAN HOWLEY: I mean, look, it's real, right? I mean, you could talk to-- I mean, I got COVID, so I couldn't go to CES. But our own Akiko Fujita did. And she was saying that everything there was basically AI, right? It's the gluten-free now of the tech world, where you would just slap it on. I don't know what vodka has gluten in it, but apparently Tito's has to tell you that it's gluten-free. And so, regardless, it's the same idea, right? You're slapping a name on something so that people go, oh, that's got AI on it, I might as well jump on board. And so you're going to see companies do that. We saw that with the Metaverse, we saw it with NFTs. Any company that even thinks about dabbling into it is going to call that out.\nAnd, I mean, obviously, the Metaverse is somewhere at this point. I just did a piece on how Epic is basically eating Meta's lunch when it comes to getting the Metaverse going. But NFTs, that's really not around, is it? So. I mean, obviously, AI has far more practical implications than a script saying that I own a digital version of a cat eating a hot dog that you can also copy and gives me absolutely nothing but empties my bank account.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Toyota Motor Corporation (TM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Microsoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +54.0%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues have been driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.Productivity and Business Processes revenues continues to increase due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.However, More Personal Computing revenues are suffering from continued weakness in Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. Also, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Exxon Mobil have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-7.5% vs. -3.5%). The company is lagging its peers when it comes to shareholders\u2019 returns. The energy giant\u2019s financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the coronavirus pandemic. Also, high input cost is hurting refining operations.Nevertheless, ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.

        "Title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says \u2018AI is really in the air now\u2019 and is planning to train 2 million Gen Z in India with tech skills",
        "Author": "  Sunny Nagpaul ",
        "Text": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced Wednesday that he\u2019s doubling down on his commitment to train India\u2019s youth in AI skills. He\u2019s aiming high, too: The goal is to have 2 million students, job seekers, and women trained through the company\u2019s ADVANTA(I)GE INDIA initiative by 2025.\nWhile visiting Mumbai for the Microsoft CEO Connection event on Wednesday, Nadella pledged to support India\u2019s vision of a self-reliant AI workforce and the country\u2019s transformation to an AI-first nation by empowering every Indian sector, like government offices and nonprofit organizations, with the transforming tools of AI.\n\u201cIndia needs a skilled workforce that can use AI to solve complex problems and create value,\u201d Microsoft wrote in a statement. And that seems to be what Indians think, too. According to a report by PwC, around 79% of Indian employees believe acquiring more digital skills is extremely necessary over the next five years, compared with about 57% of global respondents. Of Indian workers, about 61% also said adopting green skills, or technical knowledge that supports environmentally sustainable decisions, is imperative in today\u2019s workforce, compared with just 39% of global respondents.\nNadella\u2019s renewed vigor to prepare the Indian AI workforce is inclusive across social class, gender, and income levels, too. Microsoft said it will partner with 10 Indian state governments to give basic and advanced AI training to 500,000 students and job seekers in 100 rural education institutions, a move that will expand the company\u2019s existing collaboration with the Indian ministry designated to train Gen Z in digital and cybersecurity skills.\nMicrosoft\u2019s promise to train millions adds to an earlier pledge Nadella made to train 100,000 Indian developers on how to use the platform Azure AI, create and deploy AI solutions, and learn code samples. That monthlong program is open to participants of all backgrounds and levels of experience, and requires two levels of training to complete, according to Microsoft\u2019s website. The first level will educate people on how to use and create AI, while the second will measure people\u2019s ability to solve real-world problems with the software.\nThe training will also employ 5,000 instructors at higher education institutions to teach 100,000 women in rural areas and cities that don\u2019t have massive populations like Delhi and Mumbai. These cities, classified as Tier 2 or Tier 3, include Chandigarh, Jaipur, Nagpur, and Gwalior, among many others. The company has also committed to train 400,000 students in remote, tribal, and farm regions, for which it\u2019s launched three global initiatives.\nFor Indians, the additional training is fuel to a rapidly growing AI fire. According to Microsoft\u2019s Work Trend Index, 90% of Indian leaders said they\u2019ll need to hire workers who are prepared for the growth of AI\u2014but 78% of workers say they don\u2019t have the right AI knowledge to complete their current work.\nIndia\u2019s desire to rise as an economic superpower is hindered by many things, but one important factor is the difference in wealth between the country\u2019s urbanites and rural villagers.\nAccording to Statista, more than 909 million people, or about two-thirds of India\u2019s population, live in the country\u2019s rural areas. And the villages are quite different from the green fields, fresh air, and idyllic farms that may come to mind. People who live in India\u2019s rural areas often lack basic necessities, with more than 500 million living on less than a dollar a day. Villages also tend to be riddled with caste associations and societal rules on occupations that can keep people locked into jobs as carpenters, barbers, weavers, potters, or sweepers with few other options. People in these areas face economic deprivation, like few banking or investment resources, and social neglect that continues to slow India\u2019s progress as a formidable subcontinent.\nAdvanced AI in these regions could improve some of the hardships people face. It could broaden access to financial services, improve education for children, and advance preventative health care.\nKuldip Maity, founder of Indian microfinance entity VFS Capital, says chatbots and virtual assistants can help people make informed financial decisions, manage their expenses, and improve financial literacy. In education, AI-powered software can \u201coffer personalized learning experiences\u201d to ensure that learners, \u201cregardless of their socioeconomic background, receive tailored education through which they may break out of the cycle of poverty,\u201d Maity says. AI could also revolutionize early disease diagnosis for rural Indians by filling in a critical gap where people can\u2019t access or afford diagnostic facilities.\nTo be clear, though, many rural Indians\u2014399 million, to be exact\u2014are online. About 50% of India\u2019s overall population is connected to the internet.\nThe initiatives to train more people across many different demographics and income levels is part of Microsoft\u2019s \u201cdeep commitment to enabling inclusive growth with technology,\u201d according to Puneet Chandok, the president of Microsoft India and South Asia. The country has a \u201chuge opportunity to be a global leader in AI,\u201d he said, adding that \u201ccreating AI fluency at scale is a critical step in that journey.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Productivity and Business Processes rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million.Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers, holds promise.However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings.

The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.However, exposure to catatrophic losses induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind.

        "Author": "  FRANK BAJAK ",
        "Text": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 State-backed Russian hackers broke into Microsoft's corporate email system and accessed the accounts of members of the company's leadership team, as well as those of employees on its cybersecurity and legal teams, the company said Friday.\nIn a blog post, Microsoft said the intrusion began in late November and was discovered on Jan. 12. It said the same highly skilled Russian hacking team behind the SolarWinds breach was responsible.\n\u201cA very small percentage\u201d of Microsoft corporate accounts were accessed, the company said, and some emails and attached documents were stolen.\nA company spokesperson said Microsoft had no immediate comment on which or how many members of its senior leadership had their email accounts breached. In a regulatory filing Friday, Microsoft said it was able to remove the hackers' access from the compromised accounts on or about Jan. 13.\n\u201cWe are in the process of notifying employees whose email was accessed,\u201d Microsoft said, adding that its investigation indicates the hackers were initially targeting email accounts for information related to their activities.\nThe Microsoft disclosure comes a month after a new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule took effect that compels publicly traded companies to disclose breaches that could negatively impact their business. It gives them four days to do so unless they obtain a national-security waiver.\nIn Friday's SEC regulatory filing, Microsoft said that \u201cas of the date of this filing, the incident has not had a material impact\u201d on its operations. It added that it has not, however, \u201cdetermined whether the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact\u201d its finances.\nMicrosoft, which is based in Redmond, Washington, said the hackers from Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency were able to gain access by compromising credentials on a \u201clegacy\u201d test account, suggesting it had outdated code. After gaining a foothold, they used the account's permissions to access the accounts of the senior leadership team and others. The brute-force attack technique used by the hackers is called \u201cpassword spraying.\u201d\nThe threat actor uses a single common password to try to log into multiple accounts. In an August blog post, Microsoft described how its threat-intelligence team discovered that the same Russian hacking team had used the technique to try to steal credentials from at least 40 different global organizations through Microsoft Teams chats.\n\u201cThe attack was not the result of a vulnerability in Microsoft products or services,\u201d the company said in the blog. \u201cTo date, there is no evidence that the threat actor had any access to customer environments, production systems, source code, or AI systems. We will notify customers if any action is required.\u201d\nMicrosoft calls the hacking unit Midnight Blizzard. Prior to revamping its threat-actor nomenclature last year, it called the group Nobelium. The cybersecurity firm Mandiant, owned by Google, calls the group APT29.\nIn a 2021 blog post, Microsoft called the SolarWinds hacking campaign \u201cthe most sophisticated nation-state attack in history.\u201d In addition to U.S. government agencies, including the departments of Justice and Treasury, more than 100 private companies and think tanks were compromised, including software and telecommunications providers.\nThe main focus of the SVR is intelligence-gathering. It primarily targets governments, diplomats, think tanks and IT service providers in the U.S. and Europe.\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft Is Taking Four Xbox Exclusives to PlayStation, Nintendo Switch",
        "Author": "  Dina Bass ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. will make four exclusive Xbox games available for Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch and Sony Group Corp.\u2019s PlayStation, sharing homegrown titles with rivals in the first significant way as the company looks to boost revenue in a stagnant gaming market.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade\nCapital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal \nLargest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions\nStocks Fall Before Nvidia\u2019s Must-Watch Earnings: Markets Wrap\nUS Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\nHaving more outlets to increase games sales will give Microsoft the resources to move forward with some \u201cearly plans\u201d for future consoles, as well as new devices, Gaming Chief Executive Officer Phil Spencer said Wednesday in an interview ahead of a press event.\n\u201cWe're going to be able to do more innovative things in hardware, the more the game side of the business is having success,\u201d he said. \u201cI get excited about different form factors that allow people to play in different places.\u201d\nNot all four games will be available on both rival consoles, Spencer said. He declined to name the titles.\nSubscribe to Game On, and dive deep inside the video game business with Jason Schreier\u2019s weekly newsletter.\nAfter a nearly two-year process, Microsoft completed its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October, giving Xbox a vast array of new content but also an imperative to reap financial returns.\nMicrosoft now faces choices about when to give Xbox an advantage with exclusive games. Exclusives can drive purchases of Xbox hardware. But sharing titles with Nintendo and Sony means more copies of games will be sold.\nOver the past decade, Microsoft has sweetened the appeal of owning an Xbox by making three large game acquisitions and several smaller ones, giving the tech giant access to more exclusive content. But Microsoft also has to tread carefully in making titles exclusive, since that was a major sticking point in the antitrust review of its purchase of Activision Blizzard. As a concession, Microsoft agreed to continue selling Activision\u2019s highly lucrative Call of Duty on rival platforms.\nWhen Microsoft buys a company that supplies games for Sony, for example, and then makes those games exclusively for Xbox, it\u2019s losing a revenue stream. The company has kept MineCraft, the first big acquisition under Spencer, on rival platforms and delivered on games promised exclusively to Sony after acquiring ZeniMax Inc. and its storied Bethesda Softworks in 2020. And in documents filed with Brazilian regulators in 2022, the company said it simply wouldn\u2019t be profitable for Microsoft to keep Call of Duty games off PlayStation.\nMicrosoft said Thursday the first Activision Blizzard game coming to its Game Pass subscription service will be Diablo IV on March 28. Game Pass will remain Xbox and PC-only.\n\u201cIf you're a PlayStation customer, you should not think that there's some plan that this is the beginning of all of the games coming to PlayStation or Nintendo,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cWe don't have that plan today.\u201d\nFor now, there is no intention to make the role-playing game Starfield and a new Indiana Jones game, from Microsoft\u2019s Bethesda studio, available on other consoles, Spencer said, despite speculation to the contrary.\n\u201cWe want to learn, to see what's going to happen,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI don't know if these games are going to be considered Xbox games when they hit those other platforms, and maybe they don't find an audience for some reason.\u201d\nBy not identifying the four games that will be available on Switch and PlayStation, Microsoft risks continuing to anger Xbox players, who have taken to social media to protest the move. Without exclusive games, they say, it makes no sense to buy an Xbox. Game developers, they worry, will come to the same conclusion and make their titles for PlayStation or Nintendo, which have more market share, further eroding the value of owning an Xbox and ultimately killing the possibility of any future Xbox hardware.\nBut Spencer has said in the past that the idea of games made exclusively for one device \u201cis something we\u2019re just going to see less and less of.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures\nPursuing \u2018American Dynamism,\u2019 Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC\nThe Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force\nHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars\nHow Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI released a report on Wednesday saying that hacking groups from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia are increasingly probing the use of AI large language models (LLMs) to improve their chances of successfully launching cyberattacks.\nAccording to the report, the state-affiliated groups are using AI to understand everything from satellite technology to how to develop malicious code that can evade detection by cybersecurity software.\n\"Cybercrime groups, nation-state threat actors, and other adversaries are exploring and testing different AI technologies as they emerge, in an attempt to understand potential value to their operations and the security controls they may need to circumvent,\" the companies said in the report.\nMicrosoft and OpenAI listed four different groups as using large language models in conjunction with their hacking efforts: Russia's Forest Blizzard, also known as Strontium; North Korea's Emerald Sheet, also known as Thallium; Iran's Crimson Sandstorm, also known as Curium; and China's Charcoal Typhoon, known as Chromium, and Salmon Typhoon, known as Sodium.\nIn the case of the Russian hackers, Microsoft and OpenAI say the group is using LLMs to understand satellite capabilities as well as radar technologies and getting assistance in scripting tasks and file manipulation.\nNorth Korea's Emerald Sheet has used the technology to better understand public software vulnerabilities, for scripting tasks, improving social engineering for phishing and spear-phishing email campaigns, and learning more about groups such as think tanks that deal with North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Crimson Sandstorm also used the technology for spear-phishing campaigns, developing code, and trying to get past antivirus programs.\nAs for China's Charcoal Typhoon and Salmon Typhoon, Microsoft says the groups have used LLMs for an array of reasons ranging from translations and streamlining cyber tasks to detecting coding errors and developing potentially malicious code.\nThe company said they disabled the accounts and assets of each of the groups and added that they haven't identified any \"significant attacks\" employing the LLMs they monitor.\nIt only makes sense that hackers would use AI and LLMs in an effort to launch cyberattacks. Organizations are always looking for a means to improve their chances of penetrating victims' networks, and AI is just one more means of doing so.\nMicrosoft itself has faced its share of attacks, including one it reported in January. In that intrusion Russia's Midnight Blizzard, also known as Nobelium, gained access to accounts associated with the software company's senior leadership team and its cybersecurity and legal departments, and stole emails and documents.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Atlanta\u00a0Mayor Andre Dickens has dished out a proposal for Microsoft.\u00a0\nBloomberg reports that back in 2021, the technology corporation shared it would build a new complex in Grove Park in Atlanta, GA, with a goal to create 15,000 jobs for the city. However, by 2023, it\u2019s reported that Microsoft placed the project on pause due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\nNow, Dickens is putting the spotlight back on the initial commitment from Microsoft. According to the outlet, he is set to reach out to the company about the status of the complex. What\u2019s more, if the plan isn\u2019t going to move forward, he aims to either help seize back the land for Atlanta or team up with a developer.\n\u201cWe really want them to develop their property or offer it back to us so we can develop it,\u201d Dickens told the outlet. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t know what you want to do, just let us know what you know you won\u2019t be able to do.\u201d\nWhile Bloomberg notes that Microsoft has yet to comment on Dickens\u2019 statement, the company\u2019s mission had been to transform Atlanta into one of its main hubs. In addition to an already existing office in the Atlantic Yard district, built in 2022, its plan included three data centers as well as the halted complex in Grove Park.\nIn regard to jobs, Microsoft has had its own share of layoffs as of late. As previously reported by AFROTECH\u2122, an estimated 1,900 employees were laid off from the company\u2019s gaming division.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Toyota Motor Corporation (TM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Microsoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +54.0%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues have been driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.Productivity and Business Processes revenues continues to increase due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.However, More Personal Computing revenues are suffering from continued weakness in Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. Also, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Exxon Mobil have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-7.5% vs. -3.5%). The company is lagging its peers when it comes to shareholders\u2019 returns. The energy giant\u2019s financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the coronavirus pandemic. Also, high input cost is hurting refining operations.Nevertheless, ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. In Stabroek Block, located offshore Guyana, ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook.The advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe. ExxonMobil\u2019s deal to acquire Pioneer Natural will bolster its presence in the prolific Permian Basin.(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)Toyota Motor\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+56.5% vs. +38.2%). The company\u2019s continued demand for vehicles and a robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles are set to fuel Toyota\u2019s sales volumes.The Japanese auto giant aims to generate 40% of its global sales from electric vehicles by 2025 and 70% by 2030. It plans to invest 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) for a lineup of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. For fiscal 2024, Toyota projects vehicle sales of 9.6 million units, indicating an increase from 8.82 million units sold in fiscal 2023. Its investor-friendly moves also spark optimism.However, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on the company\u2019s margins. High capex and R&D expenses on the development of electric and autonomous vehicles are likely to dent its near-term margins and cash flows.

        "Title": "Why Microsoft, Cloudflare, and Palo Alto Networks Stocks Just Dropped",
        "Author": "  Rich Smith, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tuesday dawned dark for both cybersecurity and software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, and as of 10 a.m. ET, shares of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) remain down 1.5%, 2.1%, and 4.7%, respectively.\nWhile the situation surrounding each company has its specifics (Cloudflare for instance reported strong earnings last week, Palo Alto is getting ready to report its earnings next week, and Microsoft is preparing an update on its Xbox business on Thursday), hackers appear to be the common reason behind today's declines.\nThe Hacker News reported this morning on a couple of recent high-profile hacking incidents involving two of the companies on this list. In the first, Russian (allegedly) state-sponsored hacker group Midnight Blizzard has been blamed for using \"a password spray strategy\" to break in to the OAuth app to read the emails of some Microsoft senior staff and employees. Microsoft itself described this particular hack attack as beginning in November 2023.\nThe second incident likewise appears to have taken place in November, with Cloudflare being similarly attacked by an (unidentified) state actor. This incident harkens back to the 2023 Okta breach, utilizing credentials that were stolen and not changed since then. Hackers apparently went looking for Okta's internal reports of bugs in its own systems, presumably researching vulnerabilities that it could use to make further attacks on Atlassian.\nThe common theme behind all these attacks, argues Hacker News, seems to be that certain \"nation-state actors [are] targeting SaaS service providers\" for purposes of \"espionage and intelligence gathering.\"\nSo why are Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, and Cloudflare stocks -- all companies involved in cybersecurity -- getting stung if the hackers' ultimate target is actually providers of other SaaS services? Well, not to put too fine a point on it, but the hackers seem to be finding vulnerabilities in the defenses raised by the cybersecurity companies, and winning, if not the war, then at least isolated battles. That could shake investor confidence in the cybersecurity companies' effectiveness, and their value as investments.\nThe flip side of this argument, however, is that high-profile hacking incidents still do highlight the need for good cybersecurity -- and for cybersecurity stocks. The answer to the problem of cybersecurity efforts sometimes failing certainly cannot be \"well, let's just get rid of all our cybersecurity.\"\nTo the contrary, just this morning two separate investment banks raised their price targets on Palo Alto Networks shares ahead of next week's earnings report. One of these firms, Stifel, predicted that \"ongoing secular tailwinds\" will deliver \"a strong Q2 for Palo ... and at least a reaffirmed guide,\" according to a report on The Fly this morning. Jefferies seconded the emotion, predicting that Palo Alto will report better-than-expected sales, and that annual recurring revenue will grow 50% year over year. More than just a (great) number, if that turns out to be correct, it would imply that even more customers are making cybersecurity spending an ongoing line item of their operating costs -- and that's exactly what you would expect to happen in an environment of continued and increasing hacking attempts.\nWhile I admit to having some concerns about valuations in this sector, the fact that cybersecurity remains a growth industry cannot be denied.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cloudflare right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Cloudflare, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cloudflare wasn\u2019t one of them.

You're slapping a name on something so that people go, oh, that's got AI on it, I might as well jump on board. And so you're going to see companies do that. We saw that with the Metaverse, we saw it with NFTs. Any company that even thinks about dabbling into it is going to call that out.\nAnd, I mean, obviously, the Metaverse is somewhere at this point.

        "Title": "Better Tech Stock: IBM vs. Microsoft",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are both blue-chip tech stocks, but they went in different directions over the past 10 years. IBM's shares rose just 10% as the sluggish growth of its legacy businesses offset its burgeoning cloud division. Microsoft's stock skyrocketed 986% as it successfully expanded its mobile, cloud, AI, and gaming segments.\nWhen we look at those growth trajectories, we might assume that Microsoft is still a better overall investment than IBM. However, past performance is a poor indicator of future gains, and IBM is showing flickers of life again as its revenue growth stabilizes. Over the past month, IBM's share prices jumped 16%, while Microsoft's stock climbed 11%.\nBoth companies recently impressed investors with their latest earnings reports, but could IBM's lower valuation and turnaround potential actually make it a better buy than Microsoft? Let's take a fresh look at both tech giants to decide.\nFrom 2014 to 2021, IBM's annual revenue dropped from $92.8 billion to $57.4 billion. That precipitous decline was caused by the sluggish growth of its business software, hardware, and IT services segments; its inability to expand in the booming cloud market; and a series of big divestments aimed at raising fresh cash and streamlining the company. IBM also relied too much on wasteful stock buybacks to boost its earnings per share.\nBut after IBM's cloud chief, Arvind Krishna, became its CEO in 2020, it made three sweeping changes. First, it spun off its slow-growth managed infrastructure services unit as Kyndryl in November 2021. Second, it developed more hybrid cloud and AI services that could be positioned between private and public clouds. That strategy enabled it to profit from the growth of the cloud market without going toe-to-toe against public cloud leaders like Amazon and Microsoft.\nFinally, IBM restructured its business into three simpler units (software, consulting, and infrastructure) and set a goal for generating \"sustainable mid-single digit revenue growth\" from 2022 to 2024. Its revenue rose 6% in 2022 and 2% in 2023, and analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 3% and 5%, respectively, in 2024.\nThose stable growth rates indicate IBM's turnaround efforts are paying off, but its stock still trades at 19 times forward earnings and pays a forward yield of 3.6%. That low valuation and high yield are turning Big Blue into a safe-haven stock again -- and that reputation might just help it outperform the market this year if interest rates stay elevated.\nFrom fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Microsoft's revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11%, from $77.8 billion to $211.9 billion. That growth can mainly be attributed to Satya Nadella, the company's former cloud chief who became its CEO in February 2014 and guided its transformation into a \"mobile first, cloud first\" business.\nUnder Nadella, Microsoft expanded Azure into the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS), transformed most of its desktop software into stickier cloud-based services, developed iOS and Android versions of its apps, and beefed up its Xbox gaming business with the acquisitions of several major publishers and the development of its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming platforms. It also abandoned its struggling Windows Phone segment and created new Surface devices to spark the development of more innovative Windows PCs.\nOver the past five years, Microsoft ramped up its investments in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and integrated the start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud services. That forward-thinking strategy enabled it to profit from the explosive growth of the generative AI market and drew more customers to its cloud-based ecosystem.\nAnalysts expect Microsoft's revenue and earnings to increase 15% and 19%, respectively, in fiscal 2024. Those growth rates are impressive, but its stock isn't cheap at 36 times forward earnings, and its forward dividend yield of 0.7% won't attract any serious income investors. Simply put, the market is still valuing Microsoft as a high-growth AI stock, but it could lose its luster if its cloud segment cools off or the macro situation worsens.\nIBM and Microsoft are both solid long-term investments. IBM is becoming a reliable value play again, while Microsoft is still a great way to capitalize on the growth in the cloud, AI, and gaming markets. But looking ahead, I believe IBM will outperform Microsoft through at least the end of this year as unpredictable interest rates and concerns about a brewing AI bubble drive investors toward cheaper and higher-yielding tech stocks again.\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Mark Zuckerberg explained how Meta will crush Google and Microsoft at AI\u2014and Meta warned it could cost more than $30 billion a year",
        "Author": "  Alexandra Sternlicht ",
        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg laid out Meta's gameplan for \"playing to win\" against Alphabet and Microsoft in the high-stakes AI arms race. Meta's secret weapon: its walled garden of data.\n\"There are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the common crawl data set,\u201d Zuckerberg said on Meta\u2019s earnings call on Thursday. It was a not-so-subtle jab at competitors Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which are training their AI models on the public web data crawled by their search engines every day.\nBeyond the generative AI technology that Meta already offers in its battle against the other Big Tech powers (including Apple, which teased on its earnings call Thursday that it would launch a generative AI product later this year), Zuckerberg is aiming for \u201cgeneral intelligence,\u201d the still unproven concept of a general purpose AI that can handle most tasks better than humans.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be building the most popular and advanced AI products and services. If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done,\u201d Zuckerberg said, even as his management team hinted at the hefty price tag of carrying out the project. Meta\u2019s capital expenditures could increase by as much as $9 billion this year, totalling between $30 billion to $37 billion, compared to $28.1 billion in 2023.\nAnd the company suggested this could be the new normal, noting that \u201cwe expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably no coincidence that Meta announced its first ever cash dividend to investors on Thursday. The new, 50-cent quarterly dividend, along with strong results in Meta\u2019s core advertising business, ignited Meta\u2019s stock, which shot up 14.5% in after hours trading.\nZuckerberg initially unveiled his vision for artificial general intelligence last month in an Instagram Reels video. On Thursday, he expanded on the plan, describing it as not just a far-off science project, but an effort that will incorporate AGI into Meta products like Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp.\n\u201cIt's clear that we're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan code, remember, and many other cognitive abilities in order to provide the best versions of the services that we envision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing to win here, and I expect us to continue investing aggressively in this area.\u201d\nTo realize his vision of Meta as the AI leader, Zuckerberg has yet to expand on how exactly Meta user activity will be used as training data for Meta\u2019s AI, and how the company will navigate the potential issues around user privacy.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether Zuckerberg\u2019s confidence in the value of Meta\u2019s training data compared to the vast corpus of web data used by Google is as big of an advantage as he believes. Google has the data treasure trove of YouTube, Google Office and its search engine. Still, Google AI is close-sourced so can only move as fast as engineering talent, whereas Zuckerberg pointed to his company\u2019s open source Llama model as another key advantage.\nEarnings aside, this has been a big week for Meta\u2019s head honcho. Yesterday Zuckerberg was skewered during a U.S. Senate hearing where he, most notably, stood up and apologized to families whose children died from harms inflicted by social media. (Though he did not agree to compensate the families for the harms they suffered at Senator Hawley\u2019s request.)\nWhile the apology may have been wrenching for Zuckerberg, his net worth rose by $1.6 billion (per Forbes) on Thursday with Meta\u2019s stock performance.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The projected fair value for Microsoft is US$445 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$410 suggests Microsoft is potentially trading close to its fair value\n The US$466 analyst price target for MSFT is 4.6% more than our estimate of fair value\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$66.7b\nUS$81.7b\nUS$98.5b\nUS$122.9b\nUS$146.1b\nUS$163.4b\nUS$178.0b\nUS$190.4b\nUS$201.0b\nUS$210.2b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x24\nAnalyst x26\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 11.81%\nEst @ 8.96%\nEst @ 6.96%\nEst @ 5.56%\nEst @ 4.58%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% \nUS$62.4k\nUS$71.4k\nUS$80.5k\nUS$93.9k\nUS$104.4k\nUS$109.1k\nUS$111.1k\nUS$111.1k\nUS$109.7k\nUS$107.2k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$961b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$210b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.3%) = US$4.6t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.6t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$2.3t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.3t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$410, the company appears about fair value at a 7.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.016. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

He declined to name the titles.\nSubscribe to Game On, and dive deep inside the video game business with Jason Schreier\u2019s weekly newsletter.\nAfter a nearly two-year process, Microsoft completed its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October, giving Xbox a vast array of new content but also an imperative to reap financial returns.\nMicrosoft now faces choices about when to give Xbox an advantage with exclusive games. Exclusives can drive purchases of Xbox hardware. But sharing titles with Nintendo and Sony means more copies of games will be sold.\nOver the past decade, Microsoft has sweetened the appeal of owning an Xbox by making three large game acquisitions and several smaller ones, giving the tech giant access to more exclusive content. But Microsoft also has to tread carefully in making titles exclusive, since that was a major sticking point in the antitrust review of its purchase of Activision Blizzard. As a concession, Microsoft agreed to continue selling Activision\u2019s highly lucrative Call of Duty on rival platforms.\nWhen Microsoft buys a company that supplies games for Sony, for example, and then makes those games exclusively for Xbox, it\u2019s losing a revenue stream. The company has kept MineCraft, the first big acquisition under Spencer, on rival platforms and delivered on games promised exclusively to Sony after acquiring ZeniMax Inc. and its storied Bethesda Softworks in 2020. And in documents filed with Brazilian regulators in 2022, the company said it simply wouldn\u2019t be profitable for Microsoft to keep Call of Duty games off PlayStation.\nMicrosoft said Thursday the first Activision Blizzard game coming to its Game Pass subscription service will be Diablo IV on March 28. Game Pass will remain Xbox and PC-only.\n\u201cIf you're a PlayStation customer, you should not think that there's some plan that this is the beginning of all of the games coming to PlayStation or Nintendo,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cWe don't have that plan today.\u201d\nFor now, there is no intention to make the role-playing game Starfield and a new Indiana Jones game, from Microsoft\u2019s Bethesda studio, available on other consoles, Spencer said, despite speculation to the contrary.\n\u201cWe want to learn, to see what's going to happen,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI don't know if these games are going to be considered Xbox games when they hit those other platforms, and maybe they don't find an audience for some reason.\u201d\nBy not identifying the four games that will be available on Switch and PlayStation, Microsoft risks continuing to anger Xbox players, who have taken to social media to protest the move. Without exclusive games, they say, it makes no sense to buy an Xbox. Game developers, they worry, will come to the same conclusion and make their titles for PlayStation or Nintendo, which have more market share, further eroding the value of owning an Xbox and ultimately killing the possibility of any future Xbox hardware.\nBut Spencer has said in the past that the idea of games made exclusively for one device \u201cis something we\u2019re just going to see less and less of.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures\nPursuing \u2018American Dynamism,\u2019 Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC\nThe Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force\nHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars\nHow Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is bringing big changes to its generative AI bot Bard, rebranding the software as Gemini to match the underlying AI model that powers it and announcing a new premium version for consumers.\nGemini Advanced is a paid version of the company\u2019s bot that gives users access to Google\u2019s largest AI model, Gemini Ultra, for $19.99 per month as part of the company\u2019s Google One AI Premium plan.\nIn addition to access to Gemini Ultra, the subscription includes 2TB of Google Cloud storage and, in a future update, adds Gemini in Google Docs, Gmail, Slides, and Sheets.\n\u201cWhat you're seeing is really a phase of maturation for Google's holistic approach to AI,\u201d explained Google senior product director Jack Krawczyk. \u201cAnd Gemini is really the most direct way to access it.\u201d\nGoogle launched Bard last March as an AI platform that allows users to type in text prompts and get replies as text, code, and images. In December, Google debuted its Gemini AI model, with more advanced multimodal capabilities, including the ability to recognize text, images, video, and code, and began running Bard on the software.\nNow Google is fully rebranding Bard as Gemini as the company seeks to build out an ecosystem around the platform. Gemini is available in three versions: Gemini Nano, designed to run on smartphones; Gemini Pro, for businesses; and Gemini Ultra, for high-end AI applications like the Gemini chatbot.\nAs an example of Gemini\u2019s improved capabilities, Krawczyk offered a situation in which a user got a flat tire on their car. A person could then take a photo of the tire, upload it to Gemini, and ask how to change the tire. The bot would then provide step-by-step instructions for how to put on a doughnut.\nAndroid users will be able to access Gemini via the new Gemini app through the Google Play store or by pulling up the Google Assistant and opting into using Gemini rather than Google Assistant.\nIf you want to go back to using Google Assistant, you can\u2019t opt out of Gemini.\nIf you\u2019ve got an iPhone, you\u2019ll be able to use Gemini via the Google app and use the toggle at the top of the screen to switch over to the bot. On the web you can go to Gemini\u2019s website.\nAt first, Gemini will be available in the US in English and then launch in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa.\nWhile the rebranding of Bard to Gemini is important, it\u2019s the availability of a paid version that is most intriguing. It serves as a new revenue source for Google, as it looks to monetize its increased investment in generative AI.\nThe move also puts Google\u2019s consumer offering into direct competition with Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Copilot Pro AI bot for consumers. That platform also costs $19.99.\nGoogle and Microsoft already compete in the enterprise space via their respective generative AI bots, which they attach to their productivity suits. Adding the consumer edition sets up yet another battleground for the AI giants to square off.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "Title": "Returns On Capital Are A Standout For Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Microsoft is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.29 = US$101b \u00f7 (US$471b - US$121b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\nTherefore, Microsoft has an ROCE of 29%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Microsoft compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Microsoft .\nMicrosoft is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 29%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 68%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\nA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Microsoft has. And a remarkable 283% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\nMicrosoft does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Microsoft  that you might be interested in.\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\nHave feedback on this article?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com, Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Microsoft\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+59.2% vs. +52.8%). The company\u2019s second-quarter results gained from strong Intelligent Cloud, and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million.Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers, holds promise.However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+75.9% vs. +47.6%). Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was also a positive.A robust advertising business contributed well. Notably, improving Alexa skills, along with an array of smart home products offerings remain tailwinds. Amazon\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses are positives, as well.Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are additional successes for Amazon. Also, a deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, macroeconomic challenges are among its concerns.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+35.0% vs. +29.5%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies, with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts, and is indicative of its financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels an increase in its float, driving earnings and generating maximum returns on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.However, exposure to catatrophic losses induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance.(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Abbott Laboratories and BlackRock, Inc.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Upwallstreet ",
        "Text": "Although much of the AI buzz has been somewhat saved for the magnificent seven, which are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), there are other companies successfully riding the wave. Last week, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) reported its fourth quarter earnings and it topped estimates fueled by AI demand that continues to be unrelenting in the U.S.\nFor the quarter ended on December 31st, Palantir reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $608.4 million, topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$602.4 million. Net income grew from $30.9 million, or 1 cent per share Palantir earned in 2022\u2019s comparable quarter to $93.4 million, or 4 cents per share. Adjusted earnings of 8 cents were in line with LSEG\u2019s estimate.\nPalantir reported its customer base grew 35% YoY to\u00a0497 customers it served during the fourth quarter, showing it is enjoying a surging demand in the private sector whose customer count rose 44% annually. Therefore, Palantir showed it is successfully building its business outside its legacy government sector. What\u2019s even more impressive is that Palantir used a low-cost mechanism to get customers into its pipeline.\nWhile Microsoft infused billions into OpenAI, with Amazon and Alphabet following suit by investing into Antrophic, Palantir tried to stand out with a unique lead generation strategy.\u00a0By hosting almost 600 immersive seminars that it calls \"boot camps\u201d, Palantir aimed to fuel interest in its AI platform as it gives attendees the opportunity to try out its software and understand the value of Palantir\u2019s contribution in generative AI-drive use cases. In 2023 alone, Palantir successfully hosted over 500 of those boot camps with growth of its private sector software users showing they did a good job of luring them in.\nPalantir has delivered when it comes to profitability and it passed the test of consistency.\u00a0Although its market cap of only $51 billion\u00a0doesn\u2019t place it in the\u00a0basket tech mammoths like Microsoft,\u00a0its latest jaw-dropping report had no shortage of impressive key performance indicators that sent its stock to the Moon as it rocketed by roughly 50% over the\u00a0five trading days that followed its latest report.\u00a0Like Microsoft and Amazon, Palantir showed what AI can do for business with expanding margins flowing to the bottom line, along with compounding cash flow.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Text": "Atlanta\u00a0Mayor Andre Dickens has dished out a proposal for Microsoft.\u00a0\nBloomberg reports that back in 2021, the technology corporation shared it would build a new complex in Grove Park in Atlanta, GA, with a goal to create 15,000 jobs for the city. However, by 2023, it\u2019s reported that Microsoft placed the project on pause due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\nNow, Dickens is putting the spotlight back on the initial commitment from Microsoft. According to the outlet, he is set to reach out to the company about the status of the complex. What\u2019s more, if the plan isn\u2019t going to move forward, he aims to either help seize back the land for Atlanta or team up with a developer.\n\u201cWe really want them to develop their property or offer it back to us so we can develop it,\u201d Dickens told the outlet. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t know what you want to do, just let us know what you know you won\u2019t be able to do.\u201d\nWhile Bloomberg notes that Microsoft has yet to comment on Dickens\u2019 statement, the company\u2019s mission had been to transform Atlanta into one of its main hubs. In addition to an already existing office in the Atlantic Yard district, built in 2022, its plan included three data centers as well as the halted complex in Grove Park.\nIn regard to jobs, Microsoft has had its own share of layoffs as of late. As previously reported by AFROTECH\u2122, an estimated 1,900 employees were laid off from the company\u2019s gaming division. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer shared in a memo that the layoffs occurred as part of its greater \u201cexecution plan\u201d and to \u201creduce areas of overlap.\u201d\n\u201cWe will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws,\u201d Spencer wrote. \u201cThose whose roles will be impacted will be notified, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with the respect and compassion that is consistent with our values.\u201d\n"

You see right here, it says, they say I'll never open my own business, they say they say they counted me out, they said I couldn't get a degree, or they said I couldn't code. And then it shows the actual Copilot code this thing, storyboard this movie, et cetera, et cetera. Looks pretty interesting. I mean, it kind of gives you more of an inspirational kind of vibe for AI. But in reality, I think we have a bunch of different takes here.\nThe question is, are we really going to be using this product for these said use cases?\nDAN HOWLEY: I think it's interesting because it's the bro commercial I've seen for tech stuff in a while. And I don't think it really tells you exactly what this does. I mean, Copilot is a really great product. It comes built in to--\nPRAS SABRAMANIAN: Code for my 3D open world game.\nDAN HOWLEY: There it is. All right.\nPRAS SABRAMANIAN: Brand new game. It's on Xbox store.\nDAN HOWLEY: Game developers, go get new jobs I guess. Yeah, I mean, I just think that this is the wrong marketing way to go about this.\nJOSH SCHAFER: Where it loses me is the AI pitch that I understand that sort of why you would use Copilot would be to use it to help you with your current job would make a ton of sense. Say you're writing resumes or job applications and you use AI to help you with that and make your job more efficient. And this commercial is like, well, if you never thought you could write a screenplay, you can use AI, which I think is actually maybe more the way people are scared of AI. It's like you can take screenwriters jobs by just using AI to help you and then, all of a sudden, you're going to get really good at it.\nPRAS SABRAMANIAN: I didn't see it that way. I saw it more as like an inspirational, I can do these things that are entrepreneurial or on my own. I don't need people to help me out with them. But you're absolutely right. It is sort of a thing where it's like, forget the screenwriter or forget the storyboard artist.\nHe's done, I don't need him anymore.\nDAN HOWLEY: I just I just think it's one of those things where it's-- Copilot built into Windows is awesome. Eventually, you'll be able to control your whole computer by just being like install printer and it'll, bam, do it. That's like where they're going, that's the whole idea for this. That's sick.\nSetting up a printer-- Fix that HP and Dell and everybody. It's still a monstrosity, but that's the idea. This doesn't really sell you on how easy it's going to make things. And that's the point of it.\nJOSH SCHAFER: We got to get Dan Howley on the next Microsoft ad. I think that's where-- Dan gets the AI pitch.

And this commercial is like, well, if you never thought you could write a screenplay, you can use AI, which I think is actually maybe more the way people are scared of AI. It's like you can take screenwriters jobs by just using AI to help you and then, all of a sudden, you're going to get really good at it.\nPRAS SABRAMANIAN: I didn't see it that way. I saw it more as like an inspirational, I can do these things that are entrepreneurial or on my own. I don't need people to help me out with them. But you're absolutely right. It is sort of a thing where it's like, forget the screenwriter or forget the storyboard artist.\nHe's done, I don't need him anymore.\nDAN HOWLEY: I just I just think it's one of those things where it's-- Copilot built into Windows is awesome. Eventually, you'll be able to control your whole computer by just being like install printer and it'll, bam, do it. That's like where they're going, that's the whole idea for this. That's sick.\nSetting up a printer-- Fix that HP and Dell and everybody. It's still a monstrosity, but that's the idea. This doesn't really sell you on how easy it's going to make things. And that's the point of it.\nJOSH SCHAFER: We got to get Dan Howley on the next Microsoft ad. I think that's where-- Dan gets the AI pitch. He's got to be--\nPRAS SABRAMANIAN: There's a guy with the Vision Pro out here somewhere walking around so maybe we can just have him do that.\n"

        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer and Martin Coulter\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple has won an exemption for its iMessage and Microsoft for its Bing search engine from new EU tech rules after the companies convinced antitrust regulators their services are not gateways for businesses to reach end-users.\nThe European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which takes effect in three weeks' time, requires Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Meta Platforms and ByteDance to allow third-party apps or app stores on their platforms and make it easier for people to switch to rivals.\nThe companies are also prohibited from favouring their services over rivals.\nFollowing a five-month investigation, the European Commission found iMessage, Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising \"did not qualify as gatekeeper services,\" the EU executive said in a statement.\nThe Commission said Apple's App Store, iOS operating system and Safari browser will continue to be classified as gatekeepers as will Microsoft's Linkedin social network and Windows operating system.\nIt made \"a thorough assessment of all arguments, taking into account input by relevant stakeholders\", the Commission said without providing details of the companies' arguments.\nApple had said iMessage usage is negligible, even on its devices, compared to rival messaging services in the EU and that iMessage is not an important channel for businesses to reach users in the bloc.\n\"Consumers today have access to a wide variety of messaging apps, and often use many at once, which reflects how easy it is to switch between them,\" an Apple spokesperson said.\nMicrosoft said that Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising operate as challengers in the market and are of relatively small scale, meaning they are not important gateways for business users.\n\"We will continue to engage with the Commission and industry at large to ensure Microsoft's other designated platforms comply fully with the DMA,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\nLazar Radic, an antitrust expert at the International Center for Law and Economics, said: \"It is a good sign that the Commission has considered market realities, instead of just slapping the 'gatekeeper' label on iMessage because it fulfills certain quantitative thresholds.\n\"This suggests the Commission is capable of avoiding the temptation to over-regulate.\"\nHowever, the Coalition for Open Digital Ecosystems (CODE), whose members include Google, Meta Platforms and Qualcomm, disagreed with the Commission's decision to exempt services such as iMessage.\n\"Today\u2019s surprising decision undermines the objectives of the DMA, as well as its potential to improve choice and contestability for all Europeans,\" it said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Bart Meijer and Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Barbara Lewis and Keith Weir)\n"

        "Author": "  Caleb Naysmith ",
        "Text": "Despite a booming U.S. economy and significant advancements in the tech sector, including a robust performance by companies like Nvidia Corp. and a thriving artificial intelligence (AI) industry, tech companies have continued to lay off workers at an alarming rate in 2024.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index has shown an impressive uptick and the U.S. economy added 353,000 jobs in January, outpacing economists\u2019 forecasts. However, this overall economic strength masks a wave of layoffs in the tech sector, underscoring a disconnect between the broader economy and the challenges in the tech industry.\nDon't Miss:\nA groundbreaking energy company plugs into the $400 billion EV industry and is seeking investors.\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\nIn 2024, the tech sector has already seen layoffs outpace those of the previous year, with over 42,324 tech employees laid off, averaging more than 780 layoffs each day. This follows nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, indicating a continued trend of job cuts within the industry. Major companies like Google, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp, Discord, Salesforce Inc., eBay Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. have all announced significant layoffs in January, despite the broader economic growth and job additions in other sectors\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\nSeveral factors contribute to this paradoxical situation. First, the rapid rise of AI necessitates significant investment in new technologies, leading companies to reallocate resources and trim their workforce.\nTrending: This startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.\nThe stock market\u2019s response has also played a role; companies that have announced layoffs have often seen their stock prices increase, suggesting investor approval of efforts to streamline operations and focus on profitability. This trend is compounded by pressure from Wall Street, which, following a significant sell-off of tech stocks in 2022, has pushed companies to improve their bottom lines by cutting costs, including workforce reductions\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\nThe tech sector\u2019s layoffs reflect a strategic shift toward efficiency and profitability, with companies reevaluating their workforce in light of post-pandemic operational needs and the integration of AI into their business models. Despite the layoffs, the demand for AI-related roles is expected to grow, albeit at a smaller scale, as companies continue to prioritize investments in this area\u200b\u200b.\nThis ongoing wave of layoffs, despite a supposedly booming economy, has significantly impacted the tech workforce, leading to job insecurity and a reevaluation of career paths in the industry. The narrative of tech as a stable and lucrative career choice is being challenged, pushing many to consider alternative employment opportunities or even career changes\u200b\u200b.\nIn summary, the tech industry\u2019s current state underscores a complex interplay of economic growth, technological advancement and the reconfiguration of the workforce. While the broader U.S. economy shows signs of strength, the tech sector\u2019s continued layoffs highlight the unique challenges and transitions facing one of the most dynamic industries in the global market.\nRead Next:\nFortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Despite Booming Economy And Record Profits Google, Amazon, Microsoft And More Lay Off Over 42,000 So Far In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology Inc. MU.\nThe Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4% last year, recording its best year since 2020. The index\u2019s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle last month, although finally, it closed January on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\nHowever, the tech-laden index has regained momentum in February. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 8.3% compared with 6% gain of the S&P 500 and 2.5% of the Dow. Last week, the index advanced 2.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA \u2014 the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets \u2014 raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. \u2014 the world's largest contract chipmaker \u2014 recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (\u201cWSTS\u201d) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\nOn Feb 9, the Biden administration announced an investment of $5 billion in a public-private consortium to support R&D activities in advanced computer chips. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation allots $50 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.\nThe National Semiconductor Technology Center (\"NSTC\") was funded through this act with $39 billion allocated to chip manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip R&D purposes. The newly released $5 billion will also be given to NSTC as the government recognized NSTC as the centerpiece of the administration\u2019s R&D efforts.\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 39% share of global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12% at present.\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology behemoths with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance.\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\nMETA\u2019s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\nNVIDIA Corp. is gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA\u2019s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVDA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026.\nZacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 54.7% and 64.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.9% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 30 days.\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU\u2019s chips used in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU\u2019s memory and storage.\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42.8% and 90.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.3% over the last 30 days.\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nIt\u2019s a little-known chemical company that\u2019s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.\nThis company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.\nFree: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

I think the question is what the outcome is going to potentially look like, what some of those changes could result and end up being as a result of this lawsuit. But really, this is just the latest in this ongoing strained relationship, to say the least, between Elon Musk and Sam Altman.\nSo Elon Musk here filing this lawsuit saying that the company is really just strayed from that original nonprofit mission. And we know that Musk was an early investor within the SpaceX co-founded OpenAI in 2015. Stepped down from its board in 2018. But within this lawsuit bringing up the issue that he's saying that their deal here with Microsoft for more than $10 billion, that really represents the fact that it has strayed from their initial mission.\nAnd he went on to say that OpenAI has been transformed into a closed source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company, Microsoft. So I think the question here is just where this ends up, how this ends up, and what changes could, in fact, be implemented as a result of this.\n"

Musk had also brought up that he was originally presented with this idea of an open source type of AI platform and language learning model capability by Altman here.\nLarger question, as we've seen some of these suits or allegations come forward, where this will net out, especially among some of the big investors that OpenAI has been able to take on billions of dollars from at this point.\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. I think the question is what the outcome is going to potentially look like, what some of those changes could result and end up being as a result of this lawsuit. But really, this is just the latest in this ongoing strained relationship, to say the least, between Elon Musk and Sam Altman.\nSo Elon Musk here filing this lawsuit saying that the company is really just strayed from that original nonprofit mission. And we know that Musk was an early investor within the SpaceX co-founded OpenAI in 2015. Stepped down from its board in 2018. But within this lawsuit bringing up the issue that he's saying that their deal here with Microsoft for more than $10 billion, that really represents the fact that it has strayed from their initial mission.\nAnd he went on to say that OpenAI has been transformed into a closed source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company, Microsoft. So I think the question here is just where this ends up, how this ends up, and what changes could, in fact, be implemented as a result of this.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 February 15, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Cadence Design Systems CDNS, ASML Holdings ASML and Arista Networks ANET.\nAlthough we have all become very familiar with the Artificial Intelligence darlings like Nvidia and Microsoft, there are a handful of companies that are quietly powering this revolution, creating the tools and infrastructure that enable AI's remarkable capabilities.\nWhile AI advancements grab headlines, these companies play a crucial, yet often unseen, role in its development. Here, we dive into three such companies:\nIt is also worth noting that these companies aren't overly reliant on the burgeoning technology either, as the stocks have been mega-performers in their own right. Cadence Design Systems, ASML Holdings, and Arista Networks have all trounced the broad market over the last decade, further cementing them as worthy investment considerations.\nImagine intricate blueprints for miniaturized cities teeming with billions of transistors. That's what Cadence Design Systems does, providing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software that helps design and verify complex integrated circuits (ICs), the brains powering everything from smartphones to AI supercomputers.\nCadence plays a crucial role in developing the specialized chips needed for AI applications. Their tools enable engineers to create efficient, high-performance AI chips with features like specialized processing units and optimized memory access. As AI demands grow, so too will the need for advanced EDA solutions, potentially boosting Cadence's prospects.\nCadence Design Systems currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Expectations have been upgraded across timeframes for the chip designer.\nCDNS stock is already up 10.4% YTD, showing considerable momentum.\nAt the heart of chip manufacturing lies ASML Holdings, the undisputed leader in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems. These complex machines etch minuscule circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, enabling the creation of ever-denser, more powerful chips.\nEUV lithography is crucial for producing the advanced chips needed for AI applications. ASML's dominance in this space positions them as a key player in enabling the AI revolution.\nAlthough ASML has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, signaling a mixed earnings revisions trend, it still has a lot going for.\nASML sits in the top 7% of the Zacks Industry Rank and boasts very impressive EPS growth forecasts over the next 3-5 years. Over that period, earnings are expected to climb 20.3% annually. Additionally, ASML has a near-monopoly in EUV lithography, which has incredibly high barriers of entry and recurring revenues, securing its business future.\nThe stock market has been strong since the start of the year, but ASML Holdings has been stronger. The stock is up an incredible 21.3% YTD.\nAs AI models grow larger and more complex, efficient communication between data centers becomes crucial. Enter Arista Networks, a leader in high-performance data center networking solutions.\nArista's switches and routers are specifically designed to handle the demanding workloads of AI applications, enabling efficient data transfer and communication between AI systems.\nAs can be seen in the chart below, both ANET's share price and earnings revision trend have been steadily climbing higher over the past three years. Arista Networks has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, further increasing the odds of another advance in the share price.\nANET stock has already rallied 13.7% YTD, demonstrating strong demand from investors.\nBecause none of these stocks are household names, investors who can dive a little deeper into the minutiae of the industry can gain a real edge. But don't get it twisted, just because they aren't well known doesn't mean their contributions aren't vital to technological development.\nBy enabling the creation of specialized chips, building the manufacturing foundation, and facilitating high-speed data communication, they're laying the groundwork for AI's continued advancement.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.
