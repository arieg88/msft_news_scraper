        "Author": "  Kylie Robison ",
        "Text": "Microsoft stunned the tech world on Tuesday when it announced that it has hired Mustafa Suleyman, the cofounder of $4 billion AI startup Inflection, to run Microsoft's AI operations. Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, another Inflection cofounder, is also joining Microsoft, along with an unspecified number of staffers.\nEssentially, the cloud giant, worth $3.12 trillion, has nabbed one of the most coveted teams of AI experts at a pivotal time in the evolution of the buzzy technology.\nBut the deal\u2014if that's what this arrangement can be called\u2014is highly unusual. Inflection, having recently secured a staggering $1.3 billion in funding just last year, has ranked among the most high-profile (or hyped, depending on your perspective) startups in the new crop of AI companies. As part of the deal, the company said it was shifting away from the consumer version of its Pi chatbot, launched less than one year ago. And, according to Forbes, Microsoft is not taking an equity stake in Inflection AI, and no intellectual property is changing hands.\nTo call this turn of events a head scratcher is an understatement.\nThere's a lot to unpack here, from potential conflicts with Microsoft's stake in OpenAI to Inflection cofounder Reid Hoffman sitting on Microsoft's board of directors. Could this be the pin that pops the AI bubble, or is the technology bound to be run by a select, well-funded few that can afford the compute\u2014that is, until the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission get involved?\nHere are some of the key questions raised and items to watch following Microsoft and Inflection's most unusual announcement.\nThe proverbial elephant in the room here is that Big Tech companies like Microsoft are under intense antitrust scrutiny right now. In January, the FTC said it was launching an inquiry into Microsoft's $13 billion partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT (the FTC also said it was looking at investments between Amazon and Anthropic and\u00a0Google and Anthropic).\nGiven the government's concerns about the concentration of power in the AI market, it's impossible to imagine Microsoft acquiring Inflection without facing a regulatory challenge. So what exactly is Tuesday's arrangement between the two companies? An acquihire? Microsoft's press releases describes it as an \"organizational update\" and says only that \"several members\" of the Inflection team in addition to the two cofounders are moving to Microsoft.\nMicrosoft has run this play before, although not to completion. When OpenAI's Sam Altman was fired from the startup in November, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella extended a welcoming hand to all OpenAI staff, including Altman and other executives, offering them a continuation of their work under Microsoft's umbrella. The offer, which Altman accepted, ultimately became moot when he was restored to his throne at OpenAI. As many observers at the time noted, if Microsoft had managed to onboard the entire OpenAI team, it would have effectively achieved an acquisition of OpenAI without the usual antitrust scrutiny.\nWill such a move pass muster with regulators, or will come across as a challenge that regulators feel compelled to respond to? Stay tuned.\nIt's fair to wonder why Microsoft even wants, or needs, Suleyman's AI expertise, since it already has a pricey partnership with Altman and the OpenAI team. Speculation immediately swirled on Tuesday that the move could hint at strains in the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership. According to Bloomberg, Nadella only informed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Monday about Suleyman and his team's integration into Microsoft even though the conversations with Suleyman had apparently been underway for months.\nWhile we don't really know what the current state of the relationship between Nadella and Altman looks like, this move signals that at the very least Microsoft is determined not to keep all of its AI eggs in Altman's basket. There have been other signs: In February, Microsoft made a $16 million investment in Mistral AI, a French competitor of OpenAI. And Microsoft has also taken steps to develop its own, lower-cost generative AI product that doesn't rely entirely on OpenAI technology, The Information reported in January.\nWith Tuesday's news, Inflection said that it was moving away from developing its current Pi chatbot and would instead focus on building custom chatbots for business customers. Inflection said that the soon-to-be-extinct Pi is used by millions of people a week. But that apparently is not enough in a crowded and expensive chatbot field, many of which are based on expensive LLM models (training these models requires \"eye-watering\" levels of compute, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman once said.)\nSuleyman's original vision for Inflection looked very different from the \"empathetic\" AI chatbot called Pi that it went to market with in May. The initial plan was to develop an AI \"chief of staff\" that would be capable of seamlessly managing both personal and professional aspects of life\u2014a generative AI agent poised to handle a multitude of tasks. Suleyman repeatedly insisted that it remained committed to creating this AI chief of staff, but those promises were tempered with caveats that it would require considerable time and effort.\nEven since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, the tech world has been experiencing a collective mania for AI chatbots, pouring billions of dollars into all manner of bots with friendly names (there's Claude, Rufus, Poe, and Grok \u2014 there's event a chatbot name generator). In January, OpenAI launched a GPT store that's chock full of bots. But how much differentiation and value can these bots really provide? The general concept of chatbots and copilots is probably not going away, but the demise of Pi may signal that reality is crashing into the exuberant enthusiasm that gave birth to a countless chatbots.\nThere's another curious aspect to the Microsoft-Inflection news: Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of Inflection, is a director on Microsoft's board. As Fortune reported in December, Hoffman is one of several venture capitalists, including Marc Andreessen, who sit on Big Tech boards and have potential conflicts because of the AI startups that their firms back.\nHoffman also previously served on the board of OpenAI but resigned to avoid potential conflicts of interest, citing a desire in invest in companies leveraging OpenAI's software. However, Semafor reported he was \"privately unhappy\" about being asked to leave OpenAI's board.\nIf Microsoft had acquired Inflection, Hoffman would no doubt have had to recuse himself from any involvement in the deal. But this isn't an acquisition. Still, the move, which effectively eliminates a Microsoft rival in consumer AI chatbots, raises questions about how the deal came about and the details of its terms.\nAfter publication, Hoffman posted on LinkedIn that \"this agreement with Microsoft means that all of Inflection\u2019s investors will have a good outcome today, and I anticipate good future upside.\" It's unclear whether the \"good outcome\" refers to a financial component in the deal for Inflection investors. And while the deal calls for Microsoft to license some of Inflection's technology, the future value of that technology would seem to be lower now that Inflection has lost key members of its team.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Microsoft\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nAccording to our valuation model, Microsoft seems to be fairly priced at around 6.8% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $447.00, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Furthermore, Microsoft\u2019s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 51% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? MSFT\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Microsoft at this point in time. While conducting our analysis, we found that Microsoft has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.\nIf you are no longer interested in Microsoft, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Shirin Ghaffary and Rachel Metz ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Microsoft Corp. has agreed to pay Inflection AI $650 million, largely to license its artificial intelligence software, alongside its move earlier this week to hire much of the startup\u2019s staff, according to a person familiar with the transaction.\nMicrosoft stunned the AI world on Tuesday with an announcement that it had hired Inflection\u2019s co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, along with most of the startup\u2019s 70 employees. The unusual deal, first reported by Bloomberg News, resembled an \u201cacqui-hire\u201d \u2014 but without an acquisition. Some legal and industry experts have suggested that Microsoft\u2019s Inflection deal might still spark antitrust concerns with US regulators, who are increasingly scrutinizing Big Tech\u2019s AI investments and partnerships.\nNow, with a much smaller staff, Inflection is trying to offload some of its compute capacity, or access to computing power that can be used for tasks like training AI models, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private information. The company is seeking a partial refund from its cloud computing partner CoreWeave, one of the people said. The step could reduce costs related to building AI models as Inflection shifts to an enterprise rather than consumer business model.\nAs part of the deal, Microsoft will pay $620 million to license Inflection\u2019s AI models and around $30 million for waiving any legal rights related to the mass hiring, according to one person. The financial terms were previously reported by The Information.\nMicrosoft and CoreWeave did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Inflection AI declined to comment.\nThe deal will make Inflection\u2019s investors whole, as Bloomberg previously reported, with a modest return on investment. However, those investors aren\u2019t immediately expected to reap big rewards on what once appeared to be an AI rocket ship, valued at $4 billion after raising $1.3 billion last year.\nAs investor interest in chatbots surged last year, Inflection debuted a bot named Pi \u2014 positioned as a kind of personal assistant that was nicer and more reliable than competitors. But Suleyman told Bloomberg this week that Inflection had not succeeded in finding an effective business model.\nAs the startup plots a new course, Reid Hoffman, a VC and a Microsoft board member, will stay on at Inflection as a director and co-founder. The new CEO will be Sean White, a board member who previously served as the chief research and development officer at Mozilla.\nInflection will also retain its proprietary technology. In a blog post on Tuesday, Inflection said it was well positioned to serve companies including Microsoft. \u201cOur success at training, tailoring and improving the performance of large AI models makes us uniquely well placed to be the AI platform for businesses around the world,\u201d it said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid\nBaltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each\nJustice Department to Sue Apple for Antitrust Violations as Soon as Thursday\nYemen\u2019s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won\u2019t Be Targeted\nWhat Happens If Trump Can\u2019t Post His $454 Million Bond\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Don Lemon Implosion\nWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds\nWall Street and Silicon Valley Elites Are Warming Up to Trump\nMagnificent Seven?

        "Text": "Earlier this year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) dethroned Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company. With a market capitalization of roughly $3 trillion, Microsoft is currently worth about $400 billion more than the iPhone manufacturer and stands atop the illustrious list of \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\nFollowing Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) lead, Microsoft began building its own cloud infrastructure business in 2008. In 2010, the company launched its Azure cloud platform. But Azure wasn't really in a state that would allow it to be a credible competitor to Amazon Web Services (AWS) until 2013.\nCoinciding with the appointment of Satya Nadella as CEO in 2014, Microsoft reorganized and reclassified its business segments. The company also began placing a much bigger emphasis on cloud and subscription-based businesses. While this shift helped drive substantial sales and margin growth for its productivity-and-business-processes segment, the company's intelligent cloud segment and the Azure unit within that segment have been even bigger performance drivers.\nAs the chart shows, intelligent cloud revenue has grown at a rapid pace -- and the segment is now Microsoft's biggest overall sales driver. For the company's 2023 fiscal year (ended June 30, 2023), the segment generated sales of $87.9 billion and accounted for roughly 41.5% of the business's $211.9 billion in total sales. The division also accounted for roughly 43% of the $88.5 billion in operating income that Microsoft posted that fiscal year.\nStrong performance for the Azure unit and overall intelligent cloud segment has continued in the current fiscal year and helped Microsoft become the world's most valuable company. While AWS remains the overall market leader in cloud infrastructure services, Azure continues to gain market share and it sees strong demand tailwinds in conjunction with the rise of artificial intelligence.\nEven though Apple continues to generate more revenue than Microsoft, the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business helps it have lower costs and achieve superior margins. Thanks to rapid growth and strong profits from the intelligent cloud segment, the software giant tops the list of the world's most valuable companies.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Microsoft's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership\n Recent sales by insiders \nA look at the shareholders of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nAnd last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$3.1t in market cap. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 58%.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Microsoft. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Microsoft's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Microsoft. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.9%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.1b of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. \nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Microsoft. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Microsoft has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

It did not identify those sources.\nAltman and Microsoft have spread the supercomputers across five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase. Microsoft is working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI to be launched around 2026, according to the report.\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are in the middle of the third phase of the five-phase plan, with a significant portion of the cost for the next two phases involving acquiring the needed AI chips, the report said.\nAI chips are often sold at high prices. Chip company Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC earlier in March that the latest \"Blackwell\" B200 artificial intelligence chip will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000.\nMicrosoft had also announced a duo of custom-designed computing chips in November last year.\nThe report said the new project would be designed to work with chips from different suppliers.\n\"We are always planning for the next generation of infrastructure innovations needed to continue pushing the frontier of AI capability,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

        "Text": "Microsoft's estimated fair value is US$450 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$421 share price, Microsoft appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\nOur fair value estimate is 3.8% lower than Microsoft's analyst price target of US$468\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$66.9b\nUS$81.8b\nUS$99.0b\nUS$122.9b\nUS$146.7b\nUS$164.4b\nUS$179.4b\nUS$192.1b\nUS$203.0b\nUS$212.4b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x25\nAnalyst x26\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 12.06%\nEst @ 9.13%\nEst @ 7.08%\nEst @ 5.64%\nEst @ 4.64%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% \nUS$62.6k\nUS$71.5k\nUS$80.9k\nUS$93.9k\nUS$104.8k\nUS$109.8k\nUS$112.1k\nUS$112.2k\nUS$110.8k\nUS$108.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$967b\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$212b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.3%) = US$4.7t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.7t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$2.4t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.3t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$421, the company appears about fair value at a 6.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.014. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Title": "1 Flashing Warning Signal Microsoft Investors Must Be Aware Of",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The largest company in the world, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), is also an expensive one, with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 39. This could be a massive warning sign for investors.\nSo, what is this warning sign, and what implications might Microsoft's performance have it have for the rest of the market? Let's find out.\nThe flashing warning signal for Microsoft stock is undoubtedly its valuation. With the company trading at nearly 39 times earnings, this is the most expensive Microsoft stock has been (outside of a few years when its earnings were skewed by one-time events) since the early 2000s.\nThe reason Microsoft has become so expensive is twofold: artificial intelligence (AI) and Microsoft's execution in that red-hot field. You must give Microsoft props where they're due; its rollout of AI-powered technologies has been fantastic. Compared to many other companies, Microsoft's digital assistants have integrated well into its existing products and are available for a reasonable fee (Copilot for Microsoft 365 is $30 per month with an annual commitment).\nIt also has a partner in OpenAI and its ChatGPT product, which many consider the best generative AI model available, so Microsoft is doing well in the AI game. Furthermore, its cloud computing business, Microsoft Azure, has been growing faster than its top competitors (30% year over year in its latest quarter versus 26% for Google Cloud and 13% for Amazon Web Services). This is a sign that Azure could eventually overtake Amazon as a top player in this space, which would be a huge business boost.\nBecause Microsoft products have been doing so well, the market has slapped a premium on the stock. The problem is, if you shift your focus from trailing earnings to forward earnings estimates, the stock doesn't get much cheaper.\nUsing a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a much better way to value a rapidly changing business. It uses analysts' earnings projections over the next 12 months to price the stock.\nWith Microsoft's forward P/E only slightly below its trailing P/E, Wall Street analysts don't believe Microsoft has a ton of growth left over the next year. For reference, Nvidia, a company posting unbelievable growth numbers, trades at 38 times forward earnings but 80 times trailing earnings.\nMicrosoft needs to continue posting rapid growth to keep investors happy. For the next quarter, Wall Street analysts project about 6% revenue growth and 6.4% for FY 2024, which ends June 30. They expect another 14% next year.\nIf Microsoft can't live up to investor expectations and its stock price drops, the broader market could feel the impact. Because Microsoft is so large, it makes up roughly 7% of the S&P 500. So, if Microsoft's stock falls to cheaper levels (through a price decrease, not an earnings increase), the index will be heavily swayed in a negative direction and this would have negative effects on many people's accounts since many of them own the S&P 500.\nAdditionally, if Microsoft is doing badly, it might be because a broad swath of other companies are struggling. Microsoft provides the basic productivity tools for businesses around the world. If demand for its products start to drop, it would be a sign that its customers (nearly every business in the world) are starting to slow their expansions.This could ignite a larger sell-off.\nEither way, I'd be a bit worried if I were a Microsoft shareholder. The stock is likely overvalued, but the effects of it becoming cheaper could harm the greater market. Wall Street analysts don't expect its 18% revenue growth rate to continue, although it's hard to predict the future with game-changing technologies like AI. The market is valuing Microsoft like it will have massive AI demand for a while, and any slip-up could be an issue.\nMicrosoft could continue to do well, grow at a market pace (or slightly higher), and still be far too expensive. With other stocks growing faster than Microsoft (like Nvidia), there may be better places to look to deploy your money.\nMicrosoft will likely be a successful company, but with such high expectations baked into the stock as seen in its valuation, it could be a difficult investment to make money with over the next three to five years.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 3.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nMicrosoft is expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $11.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.15 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $60.63 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.7%. The $243.6 billion and $277.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15% and +13.9%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $62.02 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.6%. EPS of $2.93 for the same period compares with $2.32 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.62%. The EPS surprise was +6.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Hammad Sadiq ",
        "Text": "In the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, OpenAI has made a name for itself as an innovator, particularly with ChatGPT. This AI chatbot, together with other tools like Dall-E and an easy to use API, has done more than just demonstrate OpenAI's technical know-how, but also its ambition to create artificial general intelligence. Within 12 months, the value of the annualized revenue of OpenAI reached $2 billion by December 2023, with demand from business customers increasing significantly and the projections for 2025 showing this figure is set to more than double. Despite OpenAI's many accomplishments, though, its private nature is a challenge for investors wishing to be part of its expansion. There are no openly traded shares to buy, and so a direct investment is not an option for the general public. This is where software giant Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a visionary stake in OpenAI through its funding, comes in.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nMicrosoft's strategic partnership and investment in OpenAI indicates it is the company that will be at the forefront of the AI revolution and makes an interesting investment opportunity. The company began with a $1 billion investment in 2019, followed by an additional $10 billion and, as such, now holds a 49% ownership stake and rights to up to 75% of profits until the time it receives back its investment. The collaboration enables the incorporation of OpenAI technologies into all Microsoft products, which thus far has led to a substantial upsurge in sales.\nThe financial performance of Microsoft shows the technology giant is not only surviving, but also benefiting from the AI revolution. With the reported increase in revenue to $62 billion in the latest quarter, which represents 18% year-over-year growth, and cloud revenue surging by 24%, Microsoft exhibits a strong financial health and an aggressive pursuit of market share, mainly in the cloud sector.\nThe successful acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, which closed in October 2023, has lifted Microsoft's gaming division and is expected to generate additional revenues, besides giving it a stronger footing in the market. Activision will give the company a strong standing in the mobile gaming segment in which historically it was lagging behind. This step not only provides Microsoft with various revenue sources, but also strengthens its competitiveness in a market worth over $250 billion. As a result of this acquisition, the company is expected to grow its top line by 4.10% ($8.84 billion) in the coming year.\nThe rapidly growing cloud infrastructure market, which reached over $68 billion worldwide (up 18 % from the previous year), has undergone some dramatic changes. Such growth points to the fifth straight quarter of significant expansion and signifies the sturdy and continuing growth of the cloud sector. Inside this flourishing market, Microsoft Azure has shown remarkable growth and the market share has increased by approximately one point to 23%. This is in contrast to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, which has consistently remained about 33%, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Cloud, which has retained its place at 11%. The amounts in terms of revenue are as follows: about $15.6 billion for Microsoft, $22.4 billion for Amazon and $7.4 billion for Google.\nIt is worth noting competitors are maintaining their market share, which is happening across the board with the revenue pie becoming bigger, meaning even stability translates into significant growth of the overall market. The fact Microsoft's market share increased by 1% to reach 23%, mainly in the period of such growth, shows it is the most bullish of the giants in the tech industry. A key factor of this success has been the company's strategic vision to implement generative AI technologies with the support of its multibillion-dollar investments in OpenAI. Microsoft Azure's incorporation of generative AI in its suite of day-to-day software products is not only riding the wave of cloud infrastructure expansion, but is also designing the future of how businesses and individuals interact with cloud services and AI technologies.\nThe expected decrease in inflation from 3% to 2.50% this year, as well as a lower probability of a recession, point to a very favorable macroeconomic background for Microsoft. Along with the strategic AI investments and the growth of the cloud infrastructure, the company, in my opinion, is well-positioned for continued growth.\nIn the coming months, the company is set to launch the Copilot chatbot for its Office 365 platform, which already has a significant user base of 345 million paid subscribers. Microsoft will offer the Copilot subscription for an extra $30 per month in addition to the existing fees. By assuming that 100 million users will subscribe, the company could see its annual revenue growth by at least $36 billion. This increase will represent an approximate 17% growth from the current annual revenue figures of $212 billion.\nMicrosoft has been beefing up its expenses, particularly with its cloud, AI and gaming platforms, but managed to expand its operating margin to 490 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2024, registering 43.60%. In view of this, the operating margin for the full year is expected to expand from 42.30% in 2023 to 43.70%, which will directly improve the bottom line.\nInvestors still have to pay attention to the issues of regulations and the related security risks. The AI market is dependent on ongoing demand, which is also influenced by technological advances, so investors need to balance opportunity with unpredictability. Microsoft's stock is not a bargain selling at forward price-earnings ratio of 35. In comparison, Alphabet, which is expected to achieve a similar rate of growth in earnings per share over the next three years, trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21. The higher valuation of Microsoft could limit its upside potential if Azure's growth suddenly declines.All in all, I think Microsoft is a company that shares its values with me personally and that is why I am sure of buying the stock. It is not just doing its best, but has grown its business and seems to be getting ahead of the competition in the cloud and AI sectors. The stock could experience some ups and downs in the short term, but should surge over the next couple of years.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) share price has soared 250% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. The last week saw the share price soften some 2.2%.\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Microsoft achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 21% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 29% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nWe know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Microsoft, it has a TSR of 268% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nIt's nice to see that Microsoft shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 65% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 30% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Microsoft better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Microsoft has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.\nWe will like Microsoft better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Microsoft has appointed DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman as the head of a newly created consumer AI unit and hired several employees of his Inflection AI startup, seeking to defend its lead against rising competition from Google.\nSuleyman will be CEO of the unit, Microsoft AI, the company said on Tuesday, bringing under one roof its consumer AI efforts such as its Copilot chatbot and the new Bing browser that uses the technology.\nThe Copilot, built using technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, is the lynchpin of Microsoft's efforts to generate revenue from its AI efforts and can write emails, summarize documents and make presentations.\n\"This infusion of new talent will enable us to accelerate our pace yet again,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a blog post.\n\"As part of this transition, Mikhail Parakhin and his entire team, including Copilot, Bing, and Edge; and Misha Bilenko and the GenAI team will move to report to Mustafa,\" he said.\nIt comes when Microsoft has been partnering with other startups including France's Mistral AI against the backdrop of heightened regulatory scrutiny of its tie-up with OpenAI.\nNadella said on Tuesday that Microsoft is \"very committed\" to its OpenAI partnership.\nKaren Simonyan, who co-founded Inflection AI along with Suleyman and Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman, will join as chief scientist.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's Google unit is expanding its AI-related efforts. Bloomberg News reported on Monday that Apple was in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone.\nInflection AI has emerged as one of the most high-flying names in the genAI race after raising $1.3 billion from Microsoft and Nvidia in a mix of cash and cloud credit at a valuation of $4 billion last June.\nThe startup behind the chatbot Pi said on Tuesday Sean White, former head of research and development at Mozilla, will be its new CEO and that it plans pivot to serving models to commercial customers, instead of focusing on consumers.\nIt also added that its Inflection-2.5 will be available on Microsoft Azure.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Sriraj Kalluvila)\n"

        "Author": "  Sunny Nagpaul ",
        "Text": "Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer turns 68 years old today, and the sixth richest person in the world has a lot to celebrate.\nWith a net worth of about $148 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Ballmer is now just shy of overtaking his old boss, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who sits at $154 billion.\nA look back at Ballmer\u2019s illustrious career reveals the secrets behind his success, but it wasn\u2019t always so glamorous. At 24, Ballmer dropped out of Stanford Business School to join Microsoft and Gates, his former Harvard classmate. As the company\u2019s 30th employee, Ballmer netted a base salary of $50,000.\nThe small tech startup quickly became one America\u2019s fastest-growing companies, overtaking the incumbent Apple and dominating the growth of personal computers in the 1990s by developing Windows, an easy-to-use operating system. Ballmer took over for Gates during a key moment of transition, in 2000, managing through the aftermath of a famous antitrust case that dated back to 1998, as well as the aftermath of the dot-com crash and the emergence of fierce competition from rivals both new and old: Google and Apple.\nBallmer tripled Microsoft\u2019s annual revenue to nearly $78 billion during his tenure, and profits swelled to $22 billion during his last full fiscal year as CEO, but the stock didn't reflect its dominance. In retrospect, Ballmer set the stage for a stunning comeback in the decades since. Microsoft now ranks 13th on the Fortune 500, while its market capitalization has conquered all others: It\u2019s the most valuable company in the world, at $3.2 trillion.\nBallmer still holds an estimated 4.5% stake in Microsoft, and has seen its value soar even further, following his successor Satya Nadella\u2019s bet on OpenAI. In 2021, Ballmer became the ninth person in the world to report a net worth of more than $100 billion, and Ballmer is the only centibillionaire to make his fortune as an employee, not as an entrepreneur.\nAfter thanking employees for the \u201ctime of my life\u201d in an emotional farewell presentation in 2014, Ballmer set his sights on other entrepreneurial adventures. The same year, he bought the NBA\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion (Forbes now values the franchise at over $4.5 billion).\nSince leaving Microsoft, Ballmer has leaned heavily into philanthropy. He donated nearly $2 billion to a donor-advised Goldman Sachs Philanthropy fund focused on economic mobility in 2018. More recently, he invested $400 million to support Black-owned businesses in 2022; $43 million in the early childhood education workforce in Washington State last March; and last September he announced a $175 million investment over the next seven years, aimed at helping 4 million young people, especially in communities of color who face systemic inequalities, along the path to economic mobility.\nIn one of his final interviews as Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2013, Ballmer sat down with Fortune to share some of his biggest tips for success.\nTake a look at the big picture\n\u201cIf the CEO doesn\u2019t see the playing field, nobody else can,\u201d Ballmer said in the 2013 interview with Fortune. \u201cThe team may need to see it too, but the CEO really needs to be able to see the entire competitive space.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s variety of products, like cloud services and personal computing, touch a lot of different markets and competition seems to lurk around every corner. During his stint as CEO, he faced criticism for not adapting quickly enough to changing market trends. Competitors in mobile devices, like Samsung and Nokia, and cloud computing services, like Google and Apple, were on the rise. Microsoft\u2019s stock was stagnating in the years leading to his retirement in 2014. Still, Microsoft\u2019s revenue nearly quadrupled under his watch.\nAlways look for talent\u00a0\nWhile at Microsoft, Ballmer hired some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley, like Steven Sinofksy, who headed Windows; J Allard, who served as chief technology officer of Xbox; and Ray Ozzie, Microsoft\u2019s chief software architect.\nIn a 2009 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Ballmer said in order \u201cto be dynamic,\u201d companies should aim to promote internal workers \u201c70% or 80% of the time,\u201d and when a company wants to take on outside hires, they should be \u201copen-minded\u201d and ask for references.\nIn interviews for potential new hires, the two biggest qualities he looks for are passion that he \u201ccan see in the eyes,\u201d and someone he can relate to. One of his favorite questions to ask is \u201ctell me about something you're proud of.\u201d\nAlways reconsider\u2013that\u2019s how to find the most successful business model\u00a0\nAt Microsoft, the name of Ballmer\u2019s game was rethink, rethink, rethink.\n\u201cThere was a day when people said all the money is in software; get out of hardware,\u201d he told Fortune in 2013. Hardware was what Apple and Samsung, Microsoft\u2019s biggest rivals at the time, were also profitable in. In 2013, Apple recorded 170.9 billion in revenue. Google recorded $55.5 billion. \u201cThen somebody will say, \u2018oh, it\u2019s all about advertising,\u2019\u201d which is what its rival, Google, was making bank on.\n\u201cThe playing field is always changing,\u201d he said, and the sentiment holds true in his current endeavors on the basketball court.\nA decade after buying the Clippers, Ballmer is still thinking creatively about how to revamp the franchise. He\u2019s been signing\u2013and retaining\u2013superstars like Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and Russell Westbrook to form a quartet of stars in preparation for the Intuit Dome grand opening in August, Forbes reported, the team\u2019s future home court and the setting of the 2026 NBA All-Star weekend.\nThis month, he launched a new brand, Halo Sports and Entertainment, which will feature the new dome, the LA Clippers, their G-league affiliate team called the Ontario Clippers, and KIA Forum, a music and entertainment arena in Inglewood, which he purchased in 2020.\nPlan for the short term and long term\n\u201cGetting the big things right that make all the money, that\u2019s long cycle,\u201d Ballmer told Fortune in 2013, emphasizing that \u201creally executing in a way that allows you to do it, that\u2019s short cycle.\u201d\nOne of the long-term projects he\u2019s chipped away at is USAFacts, a database that collects and analyzes how federal, state and local governments generate revenue and spend money. The database also includes reports users can run to gather information on topics ranging from tax rates to rates of overdoses and crime across the country.\nThe site brands itself as a \u201cnon-partisan, not-for-profit civic initiative,\u201d with no \u201cpolitical agenda or commercial motive.\u201d\nKnow where you fall short\u00a0\n\u201cI obviously understand the business stuff better than the technology stuff,\u201d Ballmer concluded in the 2013 interview, but adding, \u201cI\u2019ve grown, and when you grow, you say, \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know.'\u201d\nOne joke theory related to his limitations has cropped up: it\u2019s what Urban Dictionary calls the Ballmer Peak, or the \u201ctheory that computer programmers obtain quasi-magical, superhuman coding ability when they have a blood alcohol concentration percentage between 0.129% and 0.138%.\u201d The theory is loosely tied to Ballmer\u2014but has inspired a San Francisco organization, Originate, to organize a Ballmer Peak-A-Thon: an open bar event where people have \u201c5 hours to find the elusive Ballmer peak, and build the best worst business possible.\u201d The bar provides \u201cplenty of sill domain names\u201d to kick off the party.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

In 2021, Ballmer became the ninth person in the world to report a net worth of more than $100 billion, and Ballmer is the only centibillionaire to make his fortune as an employee, not as an entrepreneur.\nAfter thanking employees for the \u201ctime of my life\u201d in an emotional farewell presentation in 2014, Ballmer set his sights on other entrepreneurial adventures. The same year, he bought the NBA\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion (Forbes now values the franchise at over $4.5 billion).\nSince leaving Microsoft, Ballmer has leaned heavily into philanthropy. He donated nearly $2 billion to a donor-advised Goldman Sachs Philanthropy fund focused on economic mobility in 2018. More recently, he invested $400 million to support Black-owned businesses in 2022; $43 million in the early childhood education workforce in Washington State last March; and last September he announced a $175 million investment over the next seven years, aimed at helping 4 million young people, especially in communities of color who face systemic inequalities, along the path to economic mobility.\nIn one of his final interviews as Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2013, Ballmer sat down with Fortune to share some of his biggest tips for success.\nTake a look at the big picture\n\u201cIf the CEO doesn\u2019t see the playing field, nobody else can,\u201d Ballmer said in the 2013 interview with Fortune. \u201cThe team may need to see it too, but the CEO really needs to be able to see the entire competitive space.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s variety of products, like cloud services and personal computing, touch a lot of different markets and competition seems to lurk around every corner. During his stint as CEO, he faced criticism for not adapting quickly enough to changing market trends. Competitors in mobile devices, like Samsung and Nokia, and cloud computing services, like Google and Apple, were on the rise. Microsoft\u2019s stock was stagnating in the years leading to his retirement in 2014. Still, Microsoft\u2019s revenue nearly quadrupled under his watch.\nAlways look for talent\u00a0\nWhile at Microsoft, Ballmer hired some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley, like Steven Sinofksy, who headed Windows; J Allard, who served as chief technology officer of Xbox; and Ray Ozzie, Microsoft\u2019s chief software architect.\nIn a 2009 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Ballmer said in order \u201cto be dynamic,\u201d companies should aim to promote internal workers \u201c70% or 80% of the time,\u201d and when a company wants to take on outside hires, they should be \u201copen-minded\u201d and ask for references.\nIn interviews for potential new hires, the two biggest qualities he looks for are passion that he \u201ccan see in the eyes,\u201d and someone he can relate to. One of his favorite questions to ask is \u201ctell me about something you're proud of.\u201d\nAlways reconsider\u2013that\u2019s how to find the most successful business model\u00a0\nAt Microsoft, the name of Ballmer\u2019s game was rethink, rethink, rethink.\n\u201cThere was a day when people said all the money is in software; get out of hardware,\u201d he told Fortune in 2013. Hardware was what Apple and Samsung, Microsoft\u2019s biggest rivals at the time, were also profitable in. In 2013, Apple recorded 170.9 billion in revenue. Google recorded $55.5 billion. \u201cThen somebody will say, \u2018oh, it\u2019s all about advertising,\u2019\u201d which is what its rival, Google, was making bank on.\n\u201cThe playing field is always changing,\u201d he said, and the sentiment holds true in his current endeavors on the basketball court.\nA decade after buying the Clippers, Ballmer is still thinking creatively about how to revamp the franchise. He\u2019s been signing\u2013and retaining\u2013superstars like Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and Russell Westbrook to form a quartet of stars in preparation for the Intuit Dome grand opening in August, Forbes reported, the team\u2019s future home court and the setting of the 2026 NBA All-Star weekend.\nThis month, he launched a new brand, Halo Sports and Entertainment, which will feature the new dome, the LA Clippers, their G-league affiliate team called the Ontario Clippers, and KIA Forum, a music and entertainment arena in Inglewood, which he purchased in 2020.\nPlan for the short term and long term\n\u201cGetting the big things right that make all the money, that\u2019s long cycle,\u201d Ballmer told Fortune in 2013, emphasizing that \u201creally executing in a way that allows you to do it, that\u2019s short cycle.\u201d\nOne of the long-term projects he\u2019s chipped away at is USAFacts, a database that collects and analyzes how federal, state and local governments generate revenue and spend money. The database also includes reports users can run to gather information on topics ranging from tax rates to rates of overdoses and crime across the country.\nThe site brands itself as a \u201cnon-partisan, not-for-profit civic initiative,\u201d with no \u201cpolitical agenda or commercial motive.\u201d\nKnow where you fall short\u00a0\n\u201cI obviously understand the business stuff better than the technology stuff,\u201d Ballmer concluded in the 2013 interview, but adding, \u201cI\u2019ve grown, and when you grow, you say, \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know.'\u201d\nOne joke theory related to his limitations has cropped up: it\u2019s what Urban Dictionary calls the Ballmer Peak, or the \u201ctheory that computer programmers obtain quasi-magical, superhuman coding ability when they have a blood alcohol concentration percentage between 0.129% and 0.138%.\u201d The theory is loosely tied to Ballmer\u2014but has inspired a San Francisco organization, Originate, to organize a Ballmer Peak-A-Thon: an open bar event where people have \u201c5 hours to find the elusive Ballmer peak, and build the best worst business possible.\u201d The bar provides \u201cplenty of sill domain names\u201d to kick off the party.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft's estimated fair value is US$450 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$421 share price, Microsoft appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\nOur fair value estimate is 3.8% lower than Microsoft's analyst price target of US$468\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$66.9b\nUS$81.8b\nUS$99.0b\nUS$122.9b\nUS$146.7b\nUS$164.4b\nUS$179.4b\nUS$192.1b\nUS$203.0b\nUS$212.4b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x25\nAnalyst x26\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 12.06%\nEst @ 9.13%\nEst @ 7.08%\nEst @ 5.64%\nEst @ 4.64%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% \nUS$62.6k\nUS$71.5k\nUS$80.9k\nUS$93.9k\nUS$104.8k\nUS$109.8k\nUS$112.1k\nUS$112.2k\nUS$110.8k\nUS$108.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$967b\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$212b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.3%) = US$4.7t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.7t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$2.4t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.3t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$421, the company appears about fair value at a 6.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.014. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Text": "There are just five U.S. companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. These five companies, along with Tesla and Meta, make up the group known as the Magnificent Seven. To give you a sense of their scale, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s total market cap is larger than the entire Chinese stock market, and over four times the size of the total U.K. market.\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead Next: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024\nApple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are competitors, although perhaps not as directly as they once were \u2014 remember the \u2018I\u2019m a PC\u2019 commercials? Investors that have held either, or both, stocks over the years have been richly rewarded. There\u2019s no doubt that these two are among the most successful companies ever, but which one is the better investment in 2024?\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nTejas Dessai, AVP and research analyst at GlobalX ETFs, said that both stocks are very well positioned this year, but also acknowledged that there are some risks.\n\u201cApple clearly has a growth problem,\u201d Dessai said. \u201cThe iPhone business is pretty mature, China presents major headwinds and the company is viewed as a late entrant to artificial intelligence. But valuation is quite attractive, and the services and wearables business could continue to cut deeper. Meanwhile Microsoft is in a remarkable position to grow utilizing AI as a tailwind, but we think valuation is quite rich at this point and the immediate upside could be limited.\u201d\nSee More: Warren Buffett Sold His Apple Stock \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nWinner: Microsoft\nA company\u2019s ability to grow its earnings over time is an important factor in its suitability as an investment, so knowing whether Apple or Microsoft is likely to grow faster will be a key consideration. Dessai isn\u2019t the only one concerned with Apple\u2019s growth prospects. The analyst consensus growth rate over the next five years for Apple is 11% per year, the lowest five-year growth rate of any Magnificent Seven stock. Compare that to Microsoft\u2019s consensus growth rate of 16.3% and it\u2019s clear which company is better positioned to grow in the near to mid term.\nWinner: Apple\nWhile growth potential is important when evaluating a potential investment, valuation is equally if not more important. At the end of the day, price is what determines your return on investment, meaning even the very best companies can be a bad investment if you overpay.\nOne of the most common ratios used to measure valuation of publicly traded stocks is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. The higher the ratio, the more richly a stock is being valued. As Dessai noted, Microsoft is trading at a higher multiple. Its trailing 12-month P/E ratio is 36.76, while Apple is trading at a ratio of 26.51, significantly lower. In simple terms what this means is that Microsoft must grow earnings much faster than Apple to achieve a similar return on investment.\nWinner: Apple\nUnderstanding a company\u2019s financial strength is a good way to help you know how risky of an investment the stock will be. While both Apple and Microsoft are massive companies and enjoy the financial stability that comes with size, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re on equal footing. There are a million ways to measure financial strength, so it can be helpful to pick a measure that incorporates multiple factors. One such measure is the Piotroski F-score, named after its creator, Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski.\nThe F-score looks at nine different metrics to assign a score between zero and nine. Scores of eight and nine are considered strong. Microsoft currently rates an F-score of seven, which is solid if not spectacular. Apple, however, receives an eight, indicating better overall fundamentals as a business.\nObviously, as members of the Magnificent Seven, both Apple and Microsoft are outstanding businesses, and investors are unlikely to have a bad result investing in either. Right now, though, Apple appears to be the top choice to invest in based on the underlying fundamentals and cheaper valuation.\nHowever, things can change quickly in the stock market, so be sure to review your investments on a regular basis to make sure you feel good about continuing to hold them.\nIt may also be worth your while to consider other investment options. Given the incredible run that the Magnificent Seven have been on over the last few years, there is a legitimate question of how long they can continue to outperform on that level. The tide may already be going out \u2014 Tesla, for example, is trading around $175, well below its 2023 high of almost $300 per share.\n\u201cBoth [Microsoft and Apple] remain remarkable bets in the long run as we witness a moment of mass disruption unfold with AI,\u201d Dessai noted. \u201cBut chances are most investors are also significantly exposed to both the names through their core S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 exposure. We think growth in 2024 is going to favor companies benefiting from investments going into artificial intelligence, and we\u2019d suggest investors look at non-Magnificent Seven stocks to capture maximum upside.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\nDownsizing for Retirement?

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two of the market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nvidia's high-end GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks in data centers, while Microsoft is a leading investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been integrating OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into its cloud, search, and productivity tools.\nOver the past three years, Nvidia's stock has soared more than 600% while Microsoft's stock has rallied just over 70%. Nvidia was clearly the better play on the booming AI market, but will it continue to outperform Microsoft over the next few years?\nIn fiscal 2024, which ended this January, Nvidia's revenue surged 126% to $60.9 billion as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 288%. That marked a dizzying acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% decline in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2023.\nThe company struggled in fiscal 2023 as the PC market's post-pandemic slowdown throttled its sales of gaming GPUs. The crypto market's meltdown exacerbated that pressure as disillusioned miners flooded the market with secondhand GPUs.\nThe macro headwinds also drove some companies to rein in their purchases of new data center GPUs.\nBut in fiscal 2024, the soaring popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms sparked a buying frenzy in its data center GPUs. Its sales of gaming GPUs also stabilized in the second half of the year as the PC and crypto markets recovered.\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in fiscal 2024, and the market's demand is still outstripping its supply by a wide margin. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 39%. Those growth rates are astonishing, but its stock still doesn't look terribly expensive at 39 times forward earnings.\nNvidia seems like a simple way to profit from the growth of the generative AI market, which Fortune Business Insights estimates will have a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030. But investors shouldn't overlook its longer-term challenges.\nAMD is rolling out cheaper data center GPUs, its top cloud customers are developing their own first-party chips, and start-ups like Groq are creating faster dedicated chips to process natural language queries. Chinese chipmakers could also launch alternative AI chips to counter the export curbs on Nvidia's top-tier chips.\nMicrosoft is more diversified. Its sprawling ecosystem houses its Windows operating system, Office productivity software, Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Bing search engine, Xbox gaming business, and Surface hardware devices.\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both rose 7% as the expansion of its cloud business -- which includes Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 -- offset the slower growth of its Windows, Surface, and Xbox divisions, which all faced fierce headwinds as the PC and gaming markets cooled off in a post-pandemic world.\nBut for fiscal 2024, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 15% and 19%, respectively, as the growth of its cloud business accelerates again. That acceleration was driven by the integration of OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into Microsoft's cloud-based services.\nAs result, Microsoft's Azure -- the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform -- has been growing faster than the market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as its third-place competitor, Alphabet's Google Cloud.\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to have a CAGR of 14% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 16%. Those estimates assume its cloud business will continue to expand, the PC market will recover, and its acquisition of Activision Blizzard will significantly strengthen its Xbox gaming division.\nThose growth rates suggest Microsoft is still a sound way to profit from the expansion of the cloud, AI, and gaming markets -- but its stock isn't cheap at 30 times next year's earnings. If Microsoft's cloud business loses its momentum or antitrust regulators challenge its investments in OpenAI, its valuations could decline and drive its stock lower.\nNvidia and Microsoft are both promising plays on the AI market, but Nvidia's simpler business model, higher growth rates, and more reasonable valuations make it the better buy. Nvidia's investors should keep an eye on the competitive and regulatory headwinds, but it could be years before any of those challenges limit its growth.\nUntil then, Nvidia will continue to sell the market's best shovels for the AI gold rush -- and it could even eclipse Microsoft's market cap in just a few years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "1 Flashing Warning Signal Microsoft Investors Must Be Aware Of",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The largest company in the world, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), is also an expensive one, with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 39. This could be a massive warning sign for investors.\nSo, what is this warning sign, and what implications might Microsoft's performance have it have for the rest of the market? Let's find out.\nThe flashing warning signal for Microsoft stock is undoubtedly its valuation. With the company trading at nearly 39 times earnings, this is the most expensive Microsoft stock has been (outside of a few years when its earnings were skewed by one-time events) since the early 2000s.\nThe reason Microsoft has become so expensive is twofold: artificial intelligence (AI) and Microsoft's execution in that red-hot field. You must give Microsoft props where they're due; its rollout of AI-powered technologies has been fantastic. Compared to many other companies, Microsoft's digital assistants have integrated well into its existing products and are available for a reasonable fee (Copilot for Microsoft 365 is $30 per month with an annual commitment).\nIt also has a partner in OpenAI and its ChatGPT product, which many consider the best generative AI model available, so Microsoft is doing well in the AI game. Furthermore, its cloud computing business, Microsoft Azure, has been growing faster than its top competitors (30% year over year in its latest quarter versus 26% for Google Cloud and 13% for Amazon Web Services). This is a sign that Azure could eventually overtake Amazon as a top player in this space, which would be a huge business boost.\nBecause Microsoft products have been doing so well, the market has slapped a premium on the stock. The problem is, if you shift your focus from trailing earnings to forward earnings estimates, the stock doesn't get much cheaper.\nUsing a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a much better way to value a rapidly changing business. It uses analysts' earnings projections over the next 12 months to price the stock.\nWith Microsoft's forward P/E only slightly below its trailing P/E, Wall Street analysts don't believe Microsoft has a ton of growth left over the next year. For reference, Nvidia, a company posting unbelievable growth numbers, trades at 38 times forward earnings but 80 times trailing earnings.\nMicrosoft needs to continue posting rapid growth to keep investors happy. For the next quarter, Wall Street analysts project about 6% revenue growth and 6.4% for FY 2024, which ends June 30. They expect another 14% next year.\nIf Microsoft can't live up to investor expectations and its stock price drops, the broader market could feel the impact. Because Microsoft is so large, it makes up roughly 7% of the S&P 500. So, if Microsoft's stock falls to cheaper levels (through a price decrease, not an earnings increase), the index will be heavily swayed in a negative direction and this would have negative effects on many people's accounts since many of them own the S&P 500.\nAdditionally, if Microsoft is doing badly, it might be because a broad swath of other companies are struggling. Microsoft provides the basic productivity tools for businesses around the world. If demand for its products start to drop, it would be a sign that its customers (nearly every business in the world) are starting to slow their expansions.This could ignite a larger sell-off.\nEither way, I'd be a bit worried if I were a Microsoft shareholder. The stock is likely overvalued, but the effects of it becoming cheaper could harm the greater market. Wall Street analysts don't expect its 18% revenue growth rate to continue, although it's hard to predict the future with game-changing technologies like AI. The market is valuing Microsoft like it will have massive AI demand for a while, and any slip-up could be an issue.\nMicrosoft could continue to do well, grow at a market pace (or slightly higher), and still be far too expensive. With other stocks growing faster than Microsoft (like Nvidia), there may be better places to look to deploy your money.\nMicrosoft will likely be a successful company, but with such high expectations baked into the stock as seen in its valuation, it could be a difficult investment to make money with over the next three to five years.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Bloomberg News reported on Monday that Apple was in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone.\nInflection AI has emerged as one of the most high-flying names in the genAI race after raising $1.3 billion from Microsoft and Nvidia in a mix of cash and cloud credit at a valuation of $4 billion last June.\nThe startup behind the chatbot Pi said on Tuesday Sean White, former head of research and development at Mozilla, will be its new CEO and that it plans pivot to serving models to commercial customers, instead of focusing on consumers.\nIt also added that its Inflection-2.5 will be available on Microsoft Azure.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Sriraj Kalluvila)\n"

The software leader is expected to benefit tremendously over the next several years from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria recently maintained a buy rating on the stock with a $500 price target -- that's 22% higher than the current share price of $408. There was a key theme from last quarter's earnings report that explains why Wall Street analysts across the board are bullish on Microsoft's future.\nMicrosoft isn't just talking about AI, they are implementing across the business and monetizing it. This was the key theme from the company's December-ending fiscal second quarter, in which revenue grew 18% year over year (16% on a constant-currency basis).\nWhat seemed to impress analysts the most was the company's margin performance. Despite investments in AI, gross profit margin increased one point driven by the Azure cloud business and Office 365. Overall, this contributed to stellar growth on the bottom line where adjusted earnings soared 26% over the year-ago quarter (23% in constant currency).\nMicrosoft is working hard to deliver the AI improvements that customers are demanding, but they are also focused on delivering profitable growth to benefit shareholders. It's this reason that explains why Wall Street is bullish on Microsoft. Out of 55 analysts that cover the stock, 52 rate it a buy, and the remaining three rate it a hold.\nMicrosoft's ability to roll out AI features in a timely manner and still keep earnings growing at high double-digit rates is why the stock can hit new highs in 2024 and beyond.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Earlier this week, Microsoft Corp. named artificial intelligence pioneer Mustafa Suleyman chief of its consumer AI business and hired most of the staff from his Inflection AI startup. A day before, Bloomberg reported that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google was in talks to license its Gemini AI engine to Apple Inc.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBiden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows\nTrump\u2019s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World\u2019s 500 Richest People\nJapan Amps Up Intervention Threat as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990\nTrump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million\nUsing Your Premium Credit Card May Cost More After Visa-Mastercard Deal\nThe moves suggest that despite pouring billions of dollars into partnerships, investments and product development, Microsoft and Google are struggling to figure out how to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence. Neither company is moving fast enough to field consumer products that generate revenue and grab market share, and, despite their size and power, they remain vulnerable to being disrupted.\nEven as engineers labor to perfect the large language models undergirding the technology, the companies are forming alliances and scouring the world for talent and promising startups.\nForging a leading position in generative AI requires each of the tech giants to assemble various ingredients\u2014computing power, top-of-the-line AI models, trustworthy and easy-to-use products and ways of getting them to people. None of the tech giants has all of the ingredients. Google, once the pioneer in large language models, keeps releasing products with worrying errors and biases. Microsoft got a head start with exclusive access to many of OpenAI\u2019s ground-breaking models, but has never been skilled at building exciting consumer products besides video games.\nApple is years behind in artificial intelligence and, to shore up its capabilities in China, the company is in exploratory talks with Baidu Inc. about using the Chinese company\u2019s AI technology in devices sold there, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. On the plus side, Apple sells the world\u2019s most popular smartphone, and its App Store serves as a distribution platform for millions of apps. The company plans to announce an AI comeback strategy in June.\n\u201cEven large tech companies and cloud providers, with their vast resources, cannot innovate the entire generative AI ecosystem single handedly,\u201d said Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs. \u201cCompanies must constantly be on the lookout for the best talent and technology to fill gaps in their portfolios.\u201d\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella isn\u2019t satisfied with his team\u2019s efforts to create consumer products, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Over the past year, the company has baked AI into the Bing search engine, Windows, Office and other products\u2014creating various digital assistants under the new Copilot brand. Yet Bing has made few gains against search market leader Google, and the other products are works in progress. Though OpenAI has given Microsoft a first mover advantage, the startup is focused on the underlying technology not developing products for the software giant.\nThat\u2019s why Nadella recruited Suleyman to be executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft AI, along with Inflection AI co-founder Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, who will become chief scientist of the new unit. Nadella wanted someone to unify and oversee product development and believes he found that person in Suleyman, with whom he bonded during conversations about how AI could be tailored to individual users.\n\u201cReally all we\u2019re trying to do is craft a true end-to-end product experience, so the user feels that there is a seamless, fluid, human-like conversational interaction,\u201d Suleyman said in an interview Monday. He likened the work to sculpting and said \u201cthat art requires you to know the real sweet spot of when a piece of technology is ready and how to dress the experience so that it has an essence and a character which is familiar and accessible and trusted.\u201d\nNadella also knows that because AI will completely transform the industry, even Microsoft\u2019s flagship products aren\u2019t immune to disruption\u2014whether by a peer like Google or a startup that hasn\u2019t even been invented yet. \u201cThese businesses are big and they\u2019re all going to get re-litigated, right?\u201d Nadella said in an interview. \u201cSo even the incumbents can\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d\nNadella\u2019s faith in Suleyman isn\u2019t universally shared. During his time at Google\u2019s DeepMind, Suleyman wasn\u2019t focused on consumer products. At Inflection AI, he oversaw the development of a chatbot called Pi that was designed to interact with users in a more human and supportive fashion. But despite attracting a million active daily users, the startup never found a business case. Suleyman was also accused of treating DeepMind employees poorly. He has acknowledged making mistakes and says he learned from the experience. Still, it\u2019s unclear how well he\u2019ll mesh with Microsoft\u2019s existing team.\nThe proposed partnership between Google and Apple is still being worked out so there are few details of how exactly it would work. But assuming the deal comes to fruition, it could help each company with their AI efforts.\nSince early last year, Apple has been testing its own large language model codenamed Ajax, according to people familiar with the situation. Some employees also have been trying out a basic chatbot dubbed Apple GPT. But Apple\u2019s technology remains inferior to tools from Google and other rivals, according to the people, making a partnership look like the better option. Apple could ultimately team up with another company, including OpenAI, or several.\nGoogle has raced to weave AI into its products, but the company has been dogged by concerns that it\u2019s been too slow to capitalize on the shift in the market and has been playing catch up to Microsoft. Last month, the company pulled an image generator amid a flurry of criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race. A deal with Apple would be Google\u2019s highest-profile partnership for Gemini to date and could be a major boon for the company\u2019s AI efforts. Apple has more than 2 billion devices in active use that could potentially become home to Google Gemini later this year.\nPushing Google\u2019s AI tools to as many devices as possible could help make them the ones users turn to reflexively, as they do with the company\u2019s search engine, creating a virtuous cycle whereby the programs become sharper and sharper with additional user data. Earlier this year, Google struck a deal with Samsung Electronics Co. to incorporate its Gemini technology into the South Korean company\u2019s phones, offering a glimpse of how Google could leverage its relationships with Android device manufacturers in the age of generative AI.\nIndustry observers expect tech companies to continue collaborating and investing in startups to augment their services and avoid being disrupted. \u201cThey need each other, especially in a space like AI which requires engineering expertise and lots of computing power,\u201d said Dan Wang, a Columbia Business School professor who teaches innovation and entrepreneurship. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensible way for the large tech companies to spread out the risk.\u201d No one, he added, \u201chas really found a killer application just yet that people are willing to pay for.\u201d\n--With assistance from Mark Bergen, Mark Gurman and Julia Love.\n(Updates with report that Apple is in talks to use Baidu\u2019s AI technology.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley\nIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving\nHong Kong\u2019s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China\nTesla\u2019s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue\nIn This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn\u2019t Classified\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 3.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share, indicating a change of +15.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.63 points to a change of +18.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.15 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Microsoft.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $60.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.8%. The $243.69 billion and $277.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15% and +13.9%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $62.02 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.6%. EPS of $2.93 for the same period compares with $2.32 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.62%. The EPS surprise was +6.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "In the last year, many Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$412 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$429, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 8.7% of Bradford Smith's stake.\nIn the last year Microsoft insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Microsoft. Specifically, insiders ditched US$33m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$1.1b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nInsiders haven't bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Microsoft makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Microsoft that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "(This March 14 story has been corrected to say 15 million euros and not 15 billion euros, in paragraph 11)\nBy Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet unit Google enjoys a competitive edge in generative artificial intelligence due to its trove of data and AI-optimised chips, Microsoft has told EU antitrust regulators, underscoring the rivalry between the two tech giants.\nThe comments by Microsoft were in response to a consultationlaunched by the European Commission in January on the level of competition in generative AI.\nThe growing popularity of generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts and is exemplified by Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's chatbot Gemini, has triggered concerns about misinformation and fake news.\n\"Today, only one company - Google - is vertically integrated in a manner that provides it with strength and independence at every AI layer from chips to a thriving mobile app store. Everyone else must rely on partnerships to innovate and compete,\" Microsoft said in its report to the Commission.\nIt said Google's self-supply AI semiconductors will give it a competitive advantage for the years to come, while its large sets of proprietary data from Google Search Index and YouTube enable it to train its large language model Gemini.\n\"YouTube provides an unparalleled set of video content; it hosts an estimated 14 billion videos. Google has access to such content; but other AI developers do not,\" Microsoft said.\nIt said AI-powered voice assistants such as Google's Google Assistant and Apple's Siri give both companies an advantage.\n\"They are well positioned to evolve and leverage their respective existing voice assistants into leadership positions in generative AI. New entrants and competitors of Google and Apple will not enjoy the same advantages,\" Microsoft said.\nMicrosoft, whose more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI is now in EU antitrust regulators' crosshairs, also sought to fend off regulatory worries about such partnerships between Big Tech and start-ups.\n\"All of these start-ups relied on different forms of investments and partnerships that enabled them to enter and expand in the space,\" it said.\nIt pointed to Anthropic which has Google and Amazon as investors, France's Mistral in which Microsoft has invested 15 million euros and Canada's Cohere which has Salesforce and Nvidia as investors.\n\"Encouraging pro-competitive partnerships in the AI space is an effective way to prevent companies from becoming vertically integrated in a manner that would result in an anticompetitive advantage,\" Microsoft said.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n"

        "Text": "(This March 14 story has been corrected to say 15 million euros and not 15 billion euros, in paragraph 11)\nBy Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet unit Google enjoys a competitive edge in generative artificial intelligence due to its trove of data and AI-optimised chips, Microsoft has told EU antitrust regulators, underscoring the rivalry between the two tech giants.\nThe comments by Microsoft were in response to a consultationlaunched by the European Commission in January on the level of competition in generative AI.\nThe growing popularity of generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts and is exemplified by Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's chatbot Gemini, has triggered concerns about misinformation and fake news.\n\"Today, only one company - Google - is vertically integrated in a manner that provides it with strength and independence at every AI layer from chips to a thriving mobile app store. Everyone else must rely on partnerships to innovate and compete,\" Microsoft said in its report to the Commission.\nIt said Google's self-supply AI semiconductors will give it a competitive advantage for the years to come, while its large sets of proprietary data from Google Search Index and YouTube enable it to train its large language model Gemini.\n\"YouTube provides an unparalleled set of video content; it hosts an estimated 14 billion videos. Google has access to such content; but other AI developers do not,\" Microsoft said.\nIt said AI-powered voice assistants such as Google's Google Assistant and Apple's Siri give both companies an advantage.\n\"They are well positioned to evolve and leverage their respective existing voice assistants into leadership positions in generative AI. New entrants and competitors of Google and Apple will not enjoy the same advantages,\" Microsoft said.\nMicrosoft, whose more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI is now in EU antitrust regulators' crosshairs, also sought to fend off regulatory worries about such partnerships between Big Tech and start-ups.\n\"All of these start-ups relied on different forms of investments and partnerships that enabled them to enter and expand in the space,\" it said.\nIt pointed to Anthropic which has Google and Amazon as investors, France's Mistral in which Microsoft has invested 15 million euros and Canada's Cohere which has Salesforce and Nvidia as investors.\n\"Encouraging pro-competitive partnerships in the AI space is an effective way to prevent companies from becoming vertically integrated in a manner that would result in an anticompetitive advantage,\" Microsoft said.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n"

        "Title": "Better AI Buy: Microsoft vs. Alphabet Stock",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman and Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After the launch of ChatGPT, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) emerged as top rivals, and that battle has persisted. Microsoft has aligned itself with ChatGPT parent OpenAI, while Alphabet has sought to challenge its leadership with products like Bard and later Gemini. So which artificial intelligence (AI) stock is the better buy?\nJeremy Bowman (Microsoft): The question of whether to build or buy is a common one in technology, and in generative AI, Microsoft and Alphabet have largely gone in different directions in this regard.\nMicrosoft has tied its fortunes to OpenAI, the ChatGPT parent, through a reported $13 billion investment, and that has enabled Microsoft to essentially use OpenAI's technology as its own. As a result, the tech giant has been able to implement OpenAI's technology in products like its Azure cloud infrastructure services, GitHub code repository, Office productivity suite, and Bing search engine.\nThose moves are already having an impact as Microsoft said that AI added 6 percentage points to Azure's growth in the most recent quarter.\nMicrosoft's diversification also acts as a competitive advantage here. Unlike Alphabet, which makes a majority of its revenue from search advertising, Microsoft has a wide array of products that span enterprise software, video games, cloud computing, social media, and more, and that gives it more opportunities to leverage the power of AI.\nMicrosoft has also been more aggressive in AI than Alphabet has. CEO Satya Nadella has apparently been planning for this moment for years, as Microsoft first invested in back in 2019.\nAlphabet has also been investing in AI for several years, but the company has been more hesitant to release new products, and when it has it hasn't always gone well. The initial presentation for Bard was sloppy and widely panned, and Gemini has been criticized for historical inaccuracies.\nMicrosoft shows no intention of slowing down in AI; it just hired Deepmind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who also co-founded the recently shuttered Inflection AI. Microsoft stock may be expensive, but it deserves to trade at a premium. It will be hard to catch the AI leader.\nAnders Bylund (Alphabet): I have nothing but respect for Microsoft, but Redmond's finest can't measure up to Alphabet's ultimate long-term planning.\nAlphabet's visionary approach and unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation make it a compelling choice for investors seeking long-term growth. The company's core business -- online search and advertising under the Google banner -- dominates the search engine market. However, Alphabet's ambitions extend far beyond search, with the company consistently investing in cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to reshape entire industries.\nOne such area is artificial intelligence, where Alphabet's research and development efforts have produced groundbreaking advancements. From natural language processing to computer vision, Alphabet's AI technologies are being applied in diverse fields, from healthcare research to self-driving vehicles.\nMoreover, Alphabet's commitment to moonshot projects through its X division showcases its willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of revolutionary innovations. Projects like Intrinsic, Alphabet's industrial robotics project, and Loon, which aims to provide internet access to remote areas via high-altitude balloons, exemplify the company's audacious vision and long-term thinking.\nLong story short, Alphabet is ready to roll with the punches as the tech market evolves. Furthermore, the stock is much more affordable than Microsoft, whose stock has soared on the wings of its deep OpenAI partnership. You can pick up Alphabet shares at the reasonable price of 6 times sales or 27 times free cash flow today. Double those numbers to get an estimate of Microsoft's ratios.\nIn my view, Microsoft's stock looks overdue for a correction while Alphabet is getting ready to run higher. That's an easy choice.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two of the market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nvidia's high-end GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks in data centers, while Microsoft is a leading investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been integrating OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into its cloud, search, and productivity tools.\nOver the past three years, Nvidia's stock has soared more than 600% while Microsoft's stock has rallied just over 70%. Nvidia was clearly the better play on the booming AI market, but will it continue to outperform Microsoft over the next few years?\nIn fiscal 2024, which ended this January, Nvidia's revenue surged 126% to $60.9 billion as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 288%. That marked a dizzying acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% decline in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2023.\nThe company struggled in fiscal 2023 as the PC market's post-pandemic slowdown throttled its sales of gaming GPUs. The crypto market's meltdown exacerbated that pressure as disillusioned miners flooded the market with secondhand GPUs.\nThe macro headwinds also drove some companies to rein in their purchases of new data center GPUs.\nBut in fiscal 2024, the soaring popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms sparked a buying frenzy in its data center GPUs. Its sales of gaming GPUs also stabilized in the second half of the year as the PC and crypto markets recovered.\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in fiscal 2024, and the market's demand is still outstripping its supply by a wide margin. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 39%. Those growth rates are astonishing, but its stock still doesn't look terribly expensive at 39 times forward earnings.\nNvidia seems like a simple way to profit from the growth of the generative AI market, which Fortune Business Insights estimates will have a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030. But investors shouldn't overlook its longer-term challenges.\nAMD is rolling out cheaper data center GPUs, its top cloud customers are developing their own first-party chips, and start-ups like Groq are creating faster dedicated chips to process natural language queries. Chinese chipmakers could also launch alternative AI chips to counter the export curbs on Nvidia's top-tier chips.\nMicrosoft is more diversified. Its sprawling ecosystem houses its Windows operating system, Office productivity software, Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Bing search engine, Xbox gaming business, and Surface hardware devices.\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both rose 7% as the expansion of its cloud business -- which includes Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 -- offset the slower growth of its Windows, Surface, and Xbox divisions, which all faced fierce headwinds as the PC and gaming markets cooled off in a post-pandemic world.\nBut for fiscal 2024, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 15% and 19%, respectively, as the growth of its cloud business accelerates again. That acceleration was driven by the integration of OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into Microsoft's cloud-based services.\nAs result, Microsoft's Azure -- the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform -- has been growing faster than the market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as its third-place competitor, Alphabet's Google Cloud.\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to have a CAGR of 14% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 16%. Those estimates assume its cloud business will continue to expand, the PC market will recover, and its acquisition of Activision Blizzard will significantly strengthen its Xbox gaming division.\nThose growth rates suggest Microsoft is still a sound way to profit from the expansion of the cloud, AI, and gaming markets -- but its stock isn't cheap at 30 times next year's earnings. If Microsoft's cloud business loses its momentum or antitrust regulators challenge its investments in OpenAI, its valuations could decline and drive its stock lower.\nNvidia and Microsoft are both promising plays on the AI market, but Nvidia's simpler business model, higher growth rates, and more reasonable valuations make it the better buy. Nvidia's investors should keep an eye on the competitive and regulatory headwinds, but it could be years before any of those challenges limit its growth.\nUntil then, Nvidia will continue to sell the market's best shovels for the AI gold rush -- and it could even eclipse Microsoft's market cap in just a few years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock has been on a tear, gaining 50% over the past year as it comes within striking distance of a new all-time high. The company is reaping the rewards of its early pivot to embrace artificial intelligence (AI), a move that's expected to pay dividends for years to come.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives recently maintained a buy rating on the stock and boosted his price target to $500 -- up from $475. The latest price target is 19% higher than Tuesday's closing price. There's one key reason analysts and investors alike should be bullish on Microsoft stock.\nWhile many businesses are talking about AI, Microsoft is actually doing something about it. The company has integrated AI tools across a great many of its products and services. In Microsoft's fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), the company grew revenue 18% year over year to $62 billion.\nA major driver of that growth, according to Ives, is the rapid adoption of Copilot, the company's AI-powered suite of digital assistants. \"We strongly view this as Microsoft's 'iPhone Moment',\" the analyst wrote. He went on to say that \"AI [is] set to change [Microsoft's] cloud growth trajectory\" for years to come.\nThere's evidence to suggest this is already happening. Azure has been the fastest-growing of the \"Big Three\" cloud providers for two consecutive quarters, outpacing Alphabet's Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS), suggesting Microsoft is taking market share from the competition.\nBeyond the AI opportunity, Microsoft has demonstrated a consistent ability to invest in future growth and increase sales while keeping a watchful eye on the bottom line. Second-quarter gross margin expanded 151 basis points from the year-ago period, and net income surged 33% year over year.\nThat's why Wall Street is firmly behind Microsoft. Of the 55 analysts that rated the stock in February, 93% rated it a buy or strong buy, while none recommended selling.\nMicrosoft's ability to lean into AI while maintaining its focus on profitability is why the stock could continue to reach new heights.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "Google's AI blunder shows risks in scramble to catch up to Microsoft",
        "Author": " Hamza Shaban    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "The market buzz around generative AI comes with heightened scrutiny, as Google (GOOG, GOOGL) was painfully reminded for the second time.\nThe search giant said this week that it plans to relaunch its Gemini AI image generator after some users on social media showed how prompts for historical images of people generated inaccurate or unexpected results, in what critics called anti-White bias.\nOne viral post appeared to show a Gemini result for \"a portrait of a Founding Father of America\" that included a Black man and a Native American man. Other examples of image and text results prompted disapproval from prominent figures, including X owner Elon Musk, who has previously criticized the perceived liberal bias of AI tools.\nThe incident marks the latest misstep from Google as it scrambles for positioning in the blossoming market for AI products and plays catch up to Microsoft (MSFT) and its AI partner OpenAI. Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, fell almost 5% this week after the announcement that it hit pause on the tool.\nIn a memo to staff on Tuesday, CEO Sundar Pichai said, \"I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias \u2014 to be clear, that\u2019s completely unacceptable, and we got it wrong.\"\nRob Sanderson, managing director at Loop Capital, said the PR blunder suggests that Google is trailing and misperforming in the high-stakes space for generative AI and that questions surrounding its standing and search dominance will pressure its valuation.\n\"Google seems to be handling product introduction in a way unlike Google of the past,\" he said. \"We think that Google is in the unfamiliar position in not being the leader in a core, [machine learning]-driven technology. Google is trying hard to catch up and now needs to go backward to repair a core technology component while dealing with a major PR blunder, or possibly something worse.\"\nGoogle's first AI fumble came a year ago when the company released a demo of its AI chatbot, Bard, a few months after ChatGPT exploded onto the scene. Google's chatbot spit out an inaccurate response in a promotional video that was widely circulated online. In the immediate aftermath, skittish investors wiped $100 billion from Google's market value just as Microsoft's fortunes climbed.\nGoogle explained in a recent blog post that it tuned its Gemini image generation tool to show a range of people of different ethnicities and other characteristics but that it failed to account for cases that should not depict diversity.\nSome observers noted that the company's long-held supremacy in search might have fostered a stifled culture among employees that ultimately showed up in the tool.\n\"Many suggest that a cultural bias toward social issues is so deeply entwined in Google\u2019s engineering that it\u2019s being reflected in its most advanced AI products,\" said Sanderson.\nAlison Taylor, a professor at New York University whose research focuses on business ethics and social impact, said the apparent overcorrection of injecting diversity initiatives into the tech also highlights the awkward position Google and others find themselves in.\n\"Do these AI tools reflect the accurate fact that society is racist, or do they try to correct and the result is the absurdity that we see?\" she said.\nLike prior episodes involving Bud Light (BUD) and Target (T), Google has attracted the ire of a subset of conservatives who see corporate America's attempts at inclusivity as antagonistic and ham-fisted.\nLast year, conservative outcry aimed at Target and Bud Light's support of the LGBTQ community damaged the brands' financials. Experts said the companies inflamed the fierce negative publicity by appearing to back down, which drew criticism from the customers who opposed the company's actions and those that the brands were originally trying to appeal to.\nThe two companies, at least for a time, served as cautionary tales within marketing circles for seeming to not know their audience and for bumbling corporate responses to political boycotts. But Wall Street has largely moved on. Both stocks have recovered from earlier losses.\nThe market may not be as forgiving toward Google, however.\nFor those opposed to diversity initiatives, the recent incident looks like inclusivity run amok. For AI critics, it highlights the mad dash to deliver a product and the clumsy attempts to fix the biases of AI models. And for Wall Street it highlights another danger of Google playing from behind.\n\"We think that Google\u2019s uncertain position in [generative] AI and long-term implications will be a growing 'wall of worry' for investors at a minimum and the beginning of secular decline in the worst case,\" Sanderson said.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: AMD or Microsoft?",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "A boom in artificial intelligence (AI) kicked off last year and has shown no signs of slowing. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT near the end of 2022 reignited interest in the technology and forced many to rethink what was currently possible with AI.\nAs a result, demand for AI services has skyrocketed across multiple industries alongside soaring stock prices for those pivoting their businesses toward the technology. However, the industry appears to be nowhere near hitting its ceiling, with the AI market projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030.\nSo it's not too late to see big gains from AI over the long term. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are attractive ways to invest in the industry, with both investing heavily in AI.\nLet's examine AMD and Microsoft's businesses more closely and determine which is the better AI stock this month.\nShares in AMD climbed 160% since last March, rallying investors with growing prospects in AI.\nAMD was slightly overshadowed by Nvidia last year, as its rival got a head start and achieved an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI chips. However, AMD is gearing up to challenge the chipmaker this year and could see big gains from its efforts long into the future.\nLast December, AMD unveiled its new MI300X AI graphics processing unit. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients. \nAMD's earnings have yet to reflect its heavy investment in AI. However, its recent quarterly earnings suggest it's moving in the right direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted 38% revenue growth. Meanwhile, improvements in the PC market boosted AMD's client segment by 65% year over year.\nIn addition to AI chips, AMD is diversifying its position in the market by expanding into AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled. \nAMD is likely to have a bright future in AI, and it could be worth investing in its stock now while the company is still at the start of its venture into the industry. \nMicrosoft was an early investor in AI, sinking billions into OpenAI in 2019. The lucrative partnership has granted Microsoft access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry and seen its stock rise more than 59% year over year.\nMicrosoft has used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup and get ahead of competitors including Amazon and Alphabet. In 2023, the company added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite by adding AI features.\nOpenAI's models and Microsoft's massive user base from services such as its Office productivity software and Azure could make the company unstoppable in AI. Meanwhile, Microsoft hit more than $67 billion in free cash flow last year, suggesting it has the resources to continue investing in its business and keep up with its rivals.\nIn its Q2 2024, ended December 2023, Microsoft posted 18% year-over-year revenue growth, with much of its growth owed to a 20% jump in revenue from its AI-focused intelligent cloud segment. The company is on a promising trajectory in AI, making this stock a compelling buy right now.\nAMD and Microsoft are at different stages in their AI journeys, with one at the beginning of its venture into AI chips and the other having made a heavy investment in the market nearly five years ago\nBoth companies are likely to have bright futures in AI over the long term. However, AMD's market cap of $342 billion compared to Microsoft's $3 trillion could mean AMD has more room to run in the coming years.\nMoreover, this chart shows AMD's earnings could hit $7 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Microsoft's may reach close to $16. When multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios displayed in the chart, you get a stock price of $412 for AMD and $549 for Microsoft.\nThese projections would see AMD's stock rise 95% and Microsoft's 34% by 2026. And with that, AMD's stock is a no-brainer over Microsoft's this month and a screaming buy alongside its outlook in AI.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "Microsoft initiated, Broadcom upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "Author": "The Fly ",
        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\u00a0Top Upgrades: \nTD Cowen upgraded Broadcom (AVGO) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $1,500, up from $1,400, following the company's artificial intelligence infrastructure event. The firm sees potential upside from both Broadcom's custom silicon and back-end AI networking, as well as from synergies as VMWare is integrated.\nArgus upgraded Micron (MU) to Buy from Hold with a $140 price target. The company posted a \"solid\" Q2 profit against expectations of losses, while its revenue was \"well above\" the high end of prior guidance range, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nNorthland upgraded Fabrinet (FN) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $220, up from $200. The firm views the recent pullback as \"overdone\" and believes the company remains well positioned to benefit from growth in AI data center at top customer Nvidia (NVDA) and more broadly at 800G and eventually 1.6T given increasing AI driven throughput.\nRosenblatt upgraded Paramount (PARA) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $13, up from $9. The Ellison family's Skydance is reported to be in talks to buy the Redstone family's National Amusements, which owns 10% of Paramount equity but 77% of Paramount's voting rights, while Apollo's (APO) reported studio offer highlights the studio asset value, the firm tells investors.\nRosenblatt upgraded Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $10, up from $7. If Paramount is broken up, Warner Bros. Discovery would be perceived as likely to, as well, with similar puts/takes, the firm tells investors.\nTop Downgrades:\nStephens downgraded Centene (CNC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $85, down from $92. The business and stock performance have been \"firmly locked into a largely repetitive 'one-step forward, one-step back' cycle\" over the past two years, says the firm, which adds that the disappointing Texas STAR and CHIP Medicaid RFP outcome \"continued this trend into 2024.\"\nRoth MKM downgraded JinkoSolar (JKS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $25, down from $50. The firm states that its rating change is pending the company improving its profitability profile, adding that while the industry is struggling through an oversupply situation, JinkoSolar is in a strong position to consolidate share with its leading TOPCon/cost structure. \nTop Initiations: \nKeyBanc initiated coverage of Microsoft (MSFT) with an Overweight rating and $490 price target. Microsoft \"sits in the catbird seat in two of the three main ways software vendors can monetize the AI wave,\" with Azure and the suite of copilots being rolled out across Office and elsewhere in the product portfolio, the firm tells investors.\nKeyBanc initiated coverage of ServiceNow (NOW) with an Overweight rating and $1,000 price target, citing a belief it is \"the best platform play in a sector that continues to search for platforms.\"\nKeyBanc initiated coverage of Oracle (ORCL) with an Overweight rating and $150 price target. While Oracle is in the \"unenviable situation where its entire quarter is defined by a single number,\" namely Oracle Cloud Infrastructure growth in constant currency, the firm believes it \"can build a legitimate fourth\" U.S.-based public cloud of scale and expects standalone OCI growth to remain above 50% this year and into next.\nKeyBanc initiated coverage of Salesforce (CRM) with a Sector Weight rating and no price target. While noting that the firm's estimates are above consensus on \"a few metrics in the near term\" and giving the company credit for \"living under a totally new operating regime,\" the firm thinks that to be more bullish investors are going to have to assume that incremental margins will sustainably be \"some of the best in software,\" the data cloud can remain in hypergrowth for the next several years, that the buyback authorization is drained in the next 18-24 months, and that the multiple will expand.\nKeyBanc initiated coverage of Adobe (ADBE) with an Underweight rating and $445 price target. The firm expects competitive pressure to rise in the coming years and to slow Creative Cloud growth to the high single digits due to both generative AI and the emergence of strong low-end tools. \n"

        "Title": "Which Stock Is the Better Investment in 2024: Apple or Microsoft?",
        "Author": "  James Holbach ",
        "Text": "There are just five U.S. companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. These five companies, along with Tesla and Meta, make up the group known as the Magnificent Seven. To give you a sense of their scale, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s total market cap is larger than the entire Chinese stock market, and over four times the size of the total U.K. market.\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead Next: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024\nApple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are competitors, although perhaps not as directly as they once were \u2014 remember the \u2018I\u2019m a PC\u2019 commercials? Investors that have held either, or both, stocks over the years have been richly rewarded. There\u2019s no doubt that these two are among the most successful companies ever, but which one is the better investment in 2024?\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nTejas Dessai, AVP and research analyst at GlobalX ETFs, said that both stocks are very well positioned this year, but also acknowledged that there are some risks.\n\u201cApple clearly has a growth problem,\u201d Dessai said. \u201cThe iPhone business is pretty mature, China presents major headwinds and the company is viewed as a late entrant to artificial intelligence. But valuation is quite attractive, and the services and wearables business could continue to cut deeper. Meanwhile Microsoft is in a remarkable position to grow utilizing AI as a tailwind, but we think valuation is quite rich at this point and the immediate upside could be limited.\u201d\nSee More: Warren Buffett Sold His Apple Stock \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nWinner: Microsoft\nA company\u2019s ability to grow its earnings over time is an important factor in its suitability as an investment, so knowing whether Apple or Microsoft is likely to grow faster will be a key consideration. Dessai isn\u2019t the only one concerned with Apple\u2019s growth prospects. The analyst consensus growth rate over the next five years for Apple is 11% per year, the lowest five-year growth rate of any Magnificent Seven stock. Compare that to Microsoft\u2019s consensus growth rate of 16.3% and it\u2019s clear which company is better positioned to grow in the near to mid term.\nWinner: Apple\nWhile growth potential is important when evaluating a potential investment, valuation is equally if not more important. At the end of the day, price is what determines your return on investment, meaning even the very best companies can be a bad investment if you overpay.\nOne of the most common ratios used to measure valuation of publicly traded stocks is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. The higher the ratio, the more richly a stock is being valued. As Dessai noted, Microsoft is trading at a higher multiple. Its trailing 12-month P/E ratio is 36.76, while Apple is trading at a ratio of 26.51, significantly lower. In simple terms what this means is that Microsoft must grow earnings much faster than Apple to achieve a similar return on investment.\nWinner: Apple\nUnderstanding a company\u2019s financial strength is a good way to help you know how risky of an investment the stock will be. While both Apple and Microsoft are massive companies and enjoy the financial stability that comes with size, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re on equal footing. There are a million ways to measure financial strength, so it can be helpful to pick a measure that incorporates multiple factors. One such measure is the Piotroski F-score, named after its creator, Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski.\nThe F-score looks at nine different metrics to assign a score between zero and nine. Scores of eight and nine are considered strong. Microsoft currently rates an F-score of seven, which is solid if not spectacular. Apple, however, receives an eight, indicating better overall fundamentals as a business.\nObviously, as members of the Magnificent Seven, both Apple and Microsoft are outstanding businesses, and investors are unlikely to have a bad result investing in either. Right now, though, Apple appears to be the top choice to invest in based on the underlying fundamentals and cheaper valuation.\nHowever, things can change quickly in the stock market, so be sure to review your investments on a regular basis to make sure you feel good about continuing to hold them.\nIt may also be worth your while to consider other investment options. Given the incredible run that the Magnificent Seven have been on over the last few years, there is a legitimate question of how long they can continue to outperform on that level. The tide may already be going out \u2014 Tesla, for example, is trading around $175, well below its 2023 high of almost $300 per share.\n\u201cBoth [Microsoft and Apple] remain remarkable bets in the long run as we witness a moment of mass disruption unfold with AI,\u201d Dessai noted. \u201cBut chances are most investors are also significantly exposed to both the names through their core S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 exposure. We think growth in 2024 is going to favor companies benefiting from investments going into artificial intelligence, and we\u2019d suggest investors look at non-Magnificent Seven stocks to capture maximum upside.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\nDownsizing for Retirement?

So Microsoft moving higher in today's trade. Hits highest level on record. There is news around the company's so-called Secure event, which mostly focused on a tool called Copilot for Security. It sounds like they were kind of updates on availability, use cases, monetization.\nAnd the team at JPMorgan checked out the event, liked what they heard.

And now they are doing this broader release.\nAnd a couple things stood out to me. You know, how is this thing being used? It basically sounds like it's helping cybersecurity professionals be more efficient, see threats better.\nJOSH LIPTON: Right.\nJULIE HYMAN: And there's something that stood out to me in JPMorgan's note because as we talk about AI, right, we always want more concrete information about how it's being used. So this is what Microsoft-- what JPMorgan highlighted from Microsoft, that Microsoft said experienced security analysts were 22% faster and 7% more accurate across all tasks with that Copilot product. 97% said they want to use it the next time they do the same task.\nNow, and that's for experienced analysts. JPMorgan says the number must certainly be higher for more junior analysts. So that's-- I mean, if those are accurate numbers, those are pretty impressive numbers.\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and I think broadly it's, you know, kind of part and parcel what we see CEO Satya Nadella kind of doing here, right, just integrating his portfolio with his AI tools.

Target $440.\nJULIE HYMAN: So I guess they released this Copilot for Security a year ago sort of as a pilot. Forgive the repeat there, Copilot, pilot. And now they are doing this broader release.\nAnd a couple things stood out to me. You know, how is this thing being used? It basically sounds like it's helping cybersecurity professionals be more efficient, see threats better.\nJOSH LIPTON: Right.\nJULIE HYMAN: And there's something that stood out to me in JPMorgan's note because as we talk about AI, right, we always want more concrete information about how it's being used. So this is what Microsoft-- what JPMorgan highlighted from Microsoft, that Microsoft said experienced security analysts were 22% faster and 7% more accurate across all tasks with that Copilot product. 97% said they want to use it the next time they do the same task.\nNow, and that's for experienced analysts. JPMorgan says the number must certainly be higher for more junior analysts. So that's-- I mean, if those are accurate numbers, those are pretty impressive numbers.\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and I think broadly it's, you know, kind of part and parcel what we see CEO Satya Nadella kind of doing here, right, just integrating his portfolio with his AI tools. Hopefully get more customers excited by those subscriptions.\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, so we'll see what happens there, but obviously the stock is moving up today.\n"

        "Text": "Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) rallied Thursday morning, climbing as much as 3.1%, despite a downturn in the broader market. As of 1:59 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 2.4%.\nThe catalyst that sent the tech giant higher was commentary issued by a Wall Street analyst suggesting the latest version of Copilot will boost Microsoft's cloud growth.\nMicrosoft just announced that its Copilot for Security will be generally available beginning April 1. This latest addition to the company's lineup of generative AI assistants \"will help security and IT professionals catch what others miss, move faster, and strengthen team expertise.\" The system has been trained on threat intelligence to help guard against unauthorized intrusions.\nAnalysts at Wells Fargo believe this latest offering will result in incremental growth for Azure, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure service, during its fiscal fourth quarter (which ends Jun. 30) and into fiscal 2025. The analysts cite the service's consumption-based pricing, which they believe will drive greater adoption. The analysts maintained their overweight (buy) rating and price target of $460, which represents roughly 11% upside potential compared to Wednesday's closing price.\nMicrosoft has moved quickly to capitalize on the opportunity represented by generative AI. The company has integrated AI into a broad cross-section of its widely used suite of productivity tools while launching a growing number of industry- and job-specific Copilots.\nEvercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne recently updated his estimates, suggesting Microsoft's generative AI efforts could generate between $83 billion and $143 billion in incremental revenue by 2027.\nMicrosoft stock is currently selling for 36 times forward earnings, which is a bit of a premium compared to a valuation of 28 for the S&P 500. That said, given the opportunity represented by AI and the company's pole position in the space, I'd argue that Microsoft is a strong buy.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 11, 2024\nWells Fargo is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

        "Text": "Atlanta\u00a0Mayor Andre Dickens has dished out a proposal for Microsoft.\u00a0\nBloomberg reports that back in 2021, the technology corporation shared it would build a new complex in Grove Park in Atlanta, GA, with a goal to create 15,000 jobs for the city. However, by 2023, it\u2019s reported that Microsoft placed the project on pause due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\nNow, Dickens is putting the spotlight back on the initial commitment from Microsoft. According to the outlet, he is set to reach out to the company about the status of the complex. What\u2019s more, if the plan isn\u2019t going to move forward, he aims to either help seize back the land for Atlanta or team up with a developer.\n\u201cWe really want them to develop their property or offer it back to us so we can develop it,\u201d Dickens told the outlet. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t know what you want to do, just let us know what you know you won\u2019t be able to do.\u201d\nWhile Bloomberg notes that Microsoft has yet to comment on Dickens\u2019 statement, the company\u2019s mission had been to transform Atlanta into one of its main hubs. In addition to an already existing office in the Atlantic Yard district, built in 2022, its plan included three data centers as well as the halted complex in Grove Park.\nIn regard to jobs, Microsoft has had its own share of layoffs as of late. As previously reported by AFROTECH\u2122, an estimated 1,900 employees were laid off from the company\u2019s gaming division. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer shared in a memo that the layoffs occurred as part of its greater \u201cexecution plan\u201d and to \u201creduce areas of overlap.\u201d\n\u201cWe will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws,\u201d Spencer wrote. \u201cThose whose roles will be impacted will be notified, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with the respect and compassion that is consistent with our values.\u201d\n"

But had these young hopefuls not gained the respect\u2014and financial backing\u2014of their older peers early on, society might never have known the iPhone, Excel or the 'like' button.\nTwenty years later and for the first time, Gen Z founders have reached the age\u2014at the upper end of the 11-to-27-year-old spectrum\u2014where they have the experience and ability to launch the first wave of disruptors for their own generation.\nYet in a post-pandemic world, the workforce is facing inter-generational friction. Just ask actress Jodie Foster, who said younger peers can be \"annoying\" to work with or the managers who say they're \"difficult.\"\nSo it's perhaps no wonder that the GenZ bosses Fortune spoke to said they have received something of a mixed reaction to their own forays into entrepreneurship.\nThe phenomenon of being dunked on by older generations isn't new\u2014ask the millennials accused of missing out on affordable housing because they spent all their spare cash on avocados and oat milk lattes.\nBut while Gen Z can wait for time to dispel the notion that they're social media-obsessed and work-shy, investors may already have missed out on the next big thing.\nWhen Nicole Rechtszaid sits down with prospective clients for her L.A.-based social commerce company it's a \"coin toss\" as to whether they'll believe she has the experience she claims to.\nThe founder of Ghost Agency already has a raft of major clients under her belt, having worked with TikTok for a number of years before taking on the likes of Alo Yoga, G Fuel Energy and a wide range of content creators.\nRechtszaid's CV is unusual\u2014after all, she has more than a decade's worth of experience working with streaming platforms since landing her first salaried contracts on Twitch at the age of 14.\nBut even with her wealth of knowledge, her meetings are often sprinkled with a dose of distrust.\nShe explained: \"About half the time a prospective client will say to me: \u2018But you look so young? I don\u2019t believe that you actually did all this.\u2019 Or \u2018You look like a child, are you sure?\u2019 They think it\u2019s funny.\"\n\"I try and make a joke out of it because I don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable,\" the 24-year-old told Fortune. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s usually done with malintent but they definitely are saying to themselves: \u2018This person is less professional or less experienced than competitors that I\u2019m meeting with.\u2019\"\nBeing a Gen Z boss at the moment is out of the ordinary: less than 10% of the entire U.S. workforce fell into this demographic in 2020 according to Purdue Global, but this figure is expected to rise to around 30% by 2030.\nIn cases where Nicole and her 37-year-old co-founder Jenny Woo need to \"convince\" partners of their abilities, they've realized it simply isn't worth it: \"There are going to be companies that get it, and companies that absolutely do not understand.\"\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, Meagan Loyst has unique insight into the brightest minds of her generation courtesy of her organization, GenZ VCs, and its 28,000 members.\nLoyst, a New Yorker currently studying at the University of Oxford, created the platform three years ago to bring together like-minded individuals wanting to gain advice on investing, as well as entrepreneurs looking to expand their networks.\nThe CEO born in 1997 said the marketplace's preoccupation with millennial-era college hotshot founders is now giving way to investors more concerned with derisking.\n\"This notion of funding young, smart founders coming out of elite universities has been perpetuated for a long time,\" Loyst said, citing Mark Zuckerberg and Snap's Evan Spiegel.\nYet in the current macroeconomic environment, Loyst echoed Rechtszaid's belief that youth is no longer seen as a guarantee for innovation\u2014it's a red flag.\n\"This is not everyone but investors are going back to repeat founders, those who have already seen success, because it helps derisk,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s negatively impacting young founders who have less experience: the onus falls on them to establish their credibility early and be able to articulate that in a very serious way.\n\"If you\u2019re already seeing investors pulling back\u2026 and you know that the odds are stacked against you, you have to go above and beyond.\"\nAnother dynamic between Gen Z bosses and their inter-generational teams is at play: social media.\nGen Z is a group who have never known a world without Facebook, born in the era of the baby influencer with everything from their day of birth to their high school graduation snapped online.\nThough battling loneliness and isolation, they're a generation accustomed to being highly visible, with Loyst saying this can work \"for you, towards you or against you.\"\nAn influencer herself, she echoed Rechtszaid: \"People can come to a conversation with preconceived notions around what you know vs what you don\u2019t.\"\nAt Ghost Agency, Rechtszaid said the sunnier side to the age debate is that some clients acknowledge her company simply knows more about the subject.\nWhether it's because she's got more experience with the platform, understands the demographic her client is trying to reach, or has a team built to achieve these aims, Rechtszaid wants to make sure the reasons her clients trust her are exemplified in the make-up of her team.\nWith six full-time staff expected to be on the books by the end of spring, Rechtszaid said her hiring technique was centered around individual growth.\n\"Determination, motivation and really an understanding of the space is all that we care about,\" when looking for staff, she said. \"At that point, we feel people can be trained and molded into understanding how to take on a manager role or a director role.\n\"It\u2019s not that challenging to understand how to shift from something you\u2019ve done before to learning how to communicate it with other people, as long as you have the desire.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.\nWhile each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.\nWhether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.\nApple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.\nBoth Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.\nBut most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.\nI find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.\nSince SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.\nConsidering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku and Sonnet models became available on Google's cloud Tuesday. \nAt the same time, Microsoft struck a significant deal with another AI startup, Inflection. \nEarlier in March, Google  (GOOG)  announced that Anthropic's new family of artificial intelligence models \u2014 dubbed Claude 3 \u2014 will be made available to paying customers on Google's cloud-based Vertex AI platform.\nAnthropic said Tuesday that two of the three members of that family \u2014 Claude 3 Haiku and Sonnet, both smaller and faster than its largest, highest-performer Claude 3 Opus \u2014 are now generally available on the platform.\nRelated: No, Elon Musk, AI self-awareness is not 'inevitable'\nAnthropic said that Opus will be made available on the platform in the coming weeks.\n\"This collaboration enables businesses to quickly prototype and scale generative AI solutions with enterprise-grade data privacy and security,\" Anthropic said in a blog post.\nThis latest evolution of the partnership between the two companies, which began right at Anthropic's founding in 2021, comes several months after Google pledged to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic. Part of that agreement involved a $500 million cash infusion, with the remaining $1.5 billion to be invested over time.\nRelated: Microsoft CEO hedges OpenAI bet, launches new AI organization\nOn the same day that two-thirds of the Claude 3 family became available on Google's Vertex platform, fellow tech giant Microsoft  (MSFT)  completed what seems to be a soft acquisition of another well-known AI startup: Inflection, the company behind the free, personal chatbot it calls Pi.\nMicrosoft said in a memo Tuesday that it is launching a new organization \u2014 Microsoft AI \u2014 which will bundle all of Microsoft's consumer-facing AI efforts, including copilot, together under one roof. That new organization, Microsoft said, will be led by Mustafa Suleyman, the DeepMind founder who later co-founded Inflection.\nKar\u00e9n Simonyan, another Inflect co-founder, is joining Suleyman as Microsoft AI's chief scientist.\n\"Several members\" of Inflection's team, including engineers and researchers, are coming with their two founders, according to Microsoft. According to Bloomberg, however, Microsoft, as part of the arrangement, is \"hiring most of\" Inflection's staff.\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding this point.\nAt the same time as Microsoft announced the hollowing-out of this once-promising startup, Inflection announced a few changes itself; the company is abandoning its consumer-facing personal AI assistant efforts and is instead pivoting to the enterprise side of things, offering its latest model \u2014 Inflection 2.5 \u2014 on Microsoft Azure.\nInflection, according to The Information, told investors that it will fully recoup its investment in the startup, which has raised more than $1.5 billion from investors including Microsoft.\nThis semi-acquisition from Microsoft comes as the latest in a lengthening list of similar partnerships and deals. Microsoft in February announced a partnership with French startup Mistral that included a $16 million investment.\nThe company is also, of course, OpenAI's largest benefactor, having invested more than $10 billion in the startup behind ChatGPT, earning itself a non-voting board seat (and access to OpenAI's technology) in the process.\nIn the midst of all these deals, the European Commission said in January that it is investigating Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI.\n\"There's no such thing as an AI startup, just guys with models competing to be absorbed by one of the three actual AI companies,\" Meredith Whittaker, president of Signal, said in a post on X.\nIn the midst of inflating valuations and soaring stock prices, the tech giants continue to focus on pushing more and more AI, even as global regulatory efforts remain both nascent and tentative, and as concerns over the ethical implications of the tech continue to swirl.\n\"AI startups,\" Clement Delangue, the CEO of AI platform Hugging Face, warned in a post on X, \"be careful not to fall into the same trap.\"\nContact Ian with tips and AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.\nRelated: Here are all the copyright lawsuits against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI\n"

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Earlier this month, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood sat down for a podcast conversation hosted by former NBA stars Andre Iguodala and Evan Turner. While Iguodala may be best known for his NBA accolades, the athlete has a prolific career off the court as a start-up investor.\nDuring the podcast, Wood spoke at length about major themes fueling the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative. One of the emerging players in AI is big data analytics company Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR).\nWood has a large position in Palantir through her exchange-traded funds (ETFs). During her conversation, she put forth the idea that Palantir could end up being one of the largest AI companies in the world and even pose a threat to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).\nHere's why I agree with Wood, and how Palantir could become one of the most lucrative investment opportunities in the AI realm.\nBig tech took the spotlight in 2023. Microsoft kicked off the AI revolution with a multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT developer\u00a0OpenAI. Alphabet and Amazon both swiftly followed, with each investing in a competing platform called Anthropic. Moreover, chipmaker Nvidia invested in the world's most valuable privately held software start-up, Databricks.\nWith so much money flowing into high-profile AI businesses, it was easy for investors to overlook Palantir's moves. Last April, the company launched its fourth software application: the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\nIn an effort to commercialize the product in a low-cost, efficient way, Palantir began hosting immersive seminars called bootcamps. During these events, prospective customers have an opportunity to demo Palantir's various products and identify a use case centered around AI.\nI find this lead generation strategy to be quite creative and effective. By showing customer leads exactly how Palantir can help bolster their AI ambitions, the company has experienced an acceleration in client growth.\nIn 2023, Palantir grew its overall customer base by 35% annually. But more importantly, the company increased its commercial customer count by 44%. This is important as skeptics have expressed doubt that Palantir will ever truly grow beyond its legacy government business and could fail to penetrate commercial enterprises.\nI'd say that Microsoft is primarily concerned with dethroning Amazon as the leader in cloud computing -- which it hopes to achieve by unlocking more value through ChatGPT. While this might not seem like a direct threat to Palantir, I'd caution investors against assuming Palantir has an economic moat.\nPalantir does have some fierce competition -- and I've expressed previously that I see Microsoft's Fabric software platform as Palantir's primary threat.\nRight now, the biggest risk surrounding Palantir is whether the company can keep up its momentum. Microsoft is a much larger, diversified company with a bigger balance sheet and budget.\nThe popularity of bootcamps has directly impacted Palantir's revenue growth. However, a more subtle feature of these seminars is that they've allowed Palantir to keep sales and marketing expenses relatively low.\nNot only are sales moving in the right direction, but profits and free cash flow are, too. Palantir has reported positive net income on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for five consecutive quarters.\nDespite the reality of intense competition, I'm not worried about Palantir. In fact, I see the competition with Microsoft as a positive thing -- one that could reap further innovation down the road.\nBut at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.3, Palantir stock has gotten pricey. However, if you consider that the stock is trading approximately 35% below its all-time high, there's an argument to be made that Palantir's valuation is simply rightsizing from prior lows.\nGiven Palantir's focus on helping customers unlock data-driven insights to make more informed, impactful decisions at the enterprise level across a variety of industry sectors, I see it as a more prolific artificial intelligence (AI) platform than Microsoft.\nIn other words, AI is just a portion of Microsoft's overall conglomerate -- along with gaming, personal computing, and more. Palantir is relentlessly focused on furthering AI development, and has the technology engrained in its DNA.\nWhile Microsoft's size and brand recognition shouldn't go overlooked, the long-term picture still looks encouraging for Palantir. For this reason, I think Palantir's premium valuation is warranted, and see much more room for upside over the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The chatbot wars have arrived, and there are plenty of companies vying to dominate the space. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has invested $13 billion into OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. \nThe tech company has been bolstering its Bing browser and Office applications with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in an effort to win over more customers and generate an early lead.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), through its Google segment, has long been a rival of Microsoft, and it has been trying to keep up, launching its chatbot Bard last year, which ended up morphing into Gemini this year.\nGoogle's rollout hasn't exactly been smooth, however, as the company has now fumbled multiple times with its AI, the latest problem being that it is generating inaccurate images.\nBut Microsoft hasn't exactly been unscathed in this period of early growth, either. It, too, might have problems with its AI, particularly with its image generator.\nAn engineer at Microsoft, Shane Jones, says he has been testing the company's AI image generator via Copilot Designer, which uses OpenAI technology. And he has been so concerned with the images that the company's AI image generator created that he has sent a letter to the company's board and alerted the Federal Trade Commission.\nHe said he believes it runs afoul of the company's AI responsibility principles, claiming that it created controversial images, including ones that were violent, sexual, involved underage drinking, and which also appeared to violate copyright laws.\nAI-image generators can create virtually anything out of just text inputs. The concept involves a user entering some text and the AI then creating an image based on that.\nBut with the technology in its early stages, it appears that not enough safeguards and restrictions have been put into place to prevent a wide range of potentially disturbing images from being generated. And Jones is also concerned that there isn't a way to easily report and rectify these issues.\nThe public is likely more aware of the well-publicized issues relating Google's AI chatbot Gemini. The issues have been concerning enough that the company decided to pull the AI image generator last month, with the promise of relaunching it after addressing the issues.\nCritics have accused Gemini of getting images wrong, especially when it comes to generating pictures of historical figures where the race, ethnicity, and gender might not appear to be accurate.\nCEO Sundar Pichai admits that the AI needs to be fixed, but also reminds users that the technology is in its early stages. \"No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry's development, but we know the bar is high for us,\" Pichai said.\nUnfortunately, this is not new territory for Google. Last year, in Bard's first public appearance, it made a factual mistake in a promotional video.\nIt might be tempting to assume that after two blunders, Google's chatbot isn't going to catch up to OpenAI and Microsoft. But AI chatbots are likely to go through multiple iterations and enhancements over the years, and trying to declare a winner at this point would be premature at best.\nAlthough Microsoft has the early advantage thanks to its investment in OpenAI, by no means does that guarantee success for the company. And the concerns relating to its AI image-generating capabilities are a reminder that investors and consumers should expect bumps along the way, particularly when it comes to new products and services.\nInvestors are clearly more willing to pay a premium for Microsoft's stock than they are for Alphabet's, with the former trading at 37 times its trailing earnings and the latter trading at just 24. Alphabet's AI has struggled out of the gate, and that's likely a big reason why its valuation is lower than Microsoft's.\nAlphabet, however, still has a strong business, which generated $74 billion in profit last year on revenue of more than $307 billion. With solid assets such as YouTube and Google Search, AI can enhance those products even further. Investors should be careful not to assume that Alphabet can't recover from this recent bad press.\nMicrosoft might be the more polished AI stock to buy right now, but Alphabet could end up being the better investment. It has a lower valuation and is a bit of an underdog right now, so the bar is set fairly low. And with a good track record for innovation and growing its business, Alphabet could make for an underrated AI stock to own for the long haul.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Allow Nvidia to Crush Apple and Microsoft, and Become the Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock?",
        "Author": "  Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the hottest player in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most important hardware element of the servers that run advanced AI applications.\nIn the particularly high-margin category of GPUs tailored to run AI and other accelerated computing applications, Nvidia currently commands roughly 90% of the market. While competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are making moves to ramp up their capabilities in the ultra-high-performance GPU space, many analysts expect Nvidia to retain its incredible strength in the category.\nWith incredible performances behind it and management guiding for further explosive growth, Nvidia stock has risen by 240% over the last year and is up 82% so far in 2024.\nThese gains have pushed Nvidia's market cap to roughly $2.27 trillion. It now ranks as the world's third-most valuable company and the third-most valuable member of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Apple, currently sitting in second place, has a market cap of $2.65 trillion, while top dog Microsoft is valued at approximately $3.12 trillion.\nCould Nvidia soon be the world's most valuable company?\nStarting late in 2022, incredible leaps forward in artificial intelligence technologies began to emerge at a rapid pace. That progress ramped up dramatically in 2023, and it has shown no sign of slowing down this year.\nAs businesses and institutions have made moves to gain exposure to the AI space, demand has soared for Nvidia's most advanced processors. Its sales and earnings have shot through the roof.\nIn last year's fourth quarter, the company's sales grew 265% year over year to $22.16 billion. Thanks to dramatic performance acceleration in 2023's second half, Nvidia's annual sales increased by 126% to $60.9 billion.\nNvidia posted $29.76 billion in net income last year -- equal to 49% of its total sales. That's an incredible net income margin for a hardware-oriented business; those often have lower margins compared to software-oriented businesses due to the higher incremental costs associated with producing physical goods.\nBut the company's incredible margins reflect just how highly in demand its GPUs are right now. It's reasonable to expect that Nvidia's incredible growth will moderate, but the business looks poised to grow at a much faster rate than Apple and Microsoft for the next few years at least.\nApple and Microsoft still generate far more revenue and net income than Nvidia. On the other hand, the chip powerhouse looks well positioned to continue being the biggest winner in the AI revolution, and has been growing at a far faster rate than those larger tech giants.\nFor comparison, Microsoft\u00a0 grew its sales roughly by 10% over the trailing-12-month period and increased its net income by 20%. Meanwhile, Apple's revenue was flat across that stretch, though its net income rose by 7%.\nIf demand for AI services continues to rise dramatically, there's a good chance that Nvidia will surpass Apple's market cap and take the title of world's most valuable company from Microsoft within the next five years. While the GPU leader's business has historically been shaped by cyclical trends, it still appears to be in the early stages of benefiting from the unfolding AI revolution.\nRight now, Nvidia is benefiting from the emergence of an unprecedented new technology -- and that means forecasting its performance over the next five years involves a heavy dose of speculation. But given its incredible sales and earnings momentum and the overall market excitement for artificial intelligence applications, it wouldn't be shocking to see Nvidia claim the title of world's most valuable business.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Bloomberg\u2019s story found that Bing in China is removing an increasing amount of information about human rights, democracy, climate change and other topics to satisfy Beijing.\n\u201cEvery company doing business in China makes concessions to a genocidal, authoritarian regime,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAmerican companies try to rationalize their choices to US lawmakers and regulators, but there is no defending censorship at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party. It comes down to this: every American company that chooses to work in China gives the Chinese Communist Party another opportunity to achieve its goal of overpowering the United States. It really is that simple.\u201d\nLast week, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, called on Microsoft to consider shutting down its Bing platform in the country.\nA Microsoft spokesperson reiterated an earlier statement that the Chinese version of Bing is \u201cthe least censored search engine\u201d in the country and that leaving the market there \u201cwould only serve to cut people off from information they otherwise have through Bing.\u201d\n\u201cWe only censor a result in response to a narrow legal order that we conclude obligates us to do so,\u201d the spokesperson said, \u201cand we regularly push back when we believe an order doesn\u2019t comply with proper interpretation of Chinese rules.\u201d\nRubio\u2019s comments reflect bipartisan unease about US corporations\u2019 relationship with the Chinese government amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over a variety of political and economic issues.\nMeanwhile, human rights groups are voicing their own concerns.\nMaya Wang, interim China director at Human Rights Watch, called on Microsoft to make transparent its content removal policies following Chinese government requests and to consider pushing local partners to better protect human rights.\n\u201cBut if such a review suggests that it cannot reasonably act to avoid being complicit in human rights abuses, then the company should consider withdrawing from China,\u201d like Google did in 2010, Wang said.\nGoogle and Yahoo! shut down their China operations thanks in part to government crackdowns on freedom of expression. Microsoft\u2019s Bing platform is now the only Western search engine accessible on China\u2019s heavily restricted version of the internet.\nTo operate in the country, Microsoft has configured Bing to incorporate a blacklist of thousands of websites, words and phrases, including those related to \u201chuman rights,\u201d \u201cclimate change China\u201d, \u201cdemocracy,\u201d and \u201cNobel Peace Prize,\u201d Bloomberg Businessweek reported.\nSearches for information on alleged abuses of the minority Uyghur population in China\u2019s Xinjiang region return results that exclude news reports about the topic. Users searching for censored content are notified that \u201cresults are removed in response to a notice of local law requirement.\u201d\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that China\u2019s internet was \u201cfree, open, and orderly.\u201d He added that \u201cforeign-\u00adinvested enterprises in China should abide by China\u2019s laws and regulations.\u201d Beijing has previously denied committing abuses in Xinjiang.\nOmer Kanat, executive director at the Uyghur Human Rights Project, said that it was an \u201coutrage\u201d for Microsoft to be involved in removing information about what he said were atrocities against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims.\n\u201cBing should be deeply ashamed of helping the government suppress that reporting,\u201d he said, adding that Microsoft should \u201clift all censorship and donate the profits from Bing\u2019s China operations to the victims of the coverup.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHong Kong\u2019s Elderly Increasingly Opt to Retire in Mainland China\nWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds\nMagnificent Seven?

        "Text": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been on a hot streak over the past year or so, and that trend shows little signs of slowing.\nIt isn't just average investors that are bullish on these developments. Billionaires, venture capital firms, and some of the world's biggest tech companies have AI fever -- and one start-up in particular is attracting a lot of attention.\nFigure AI is working on a humanoid robot -- dubbed Figure 01 -- that has attracted a lot of attention. It was founded by serial entrepreneur Brett Adcock, who also founded Archer Aviation -- an aerospace company working on an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.\nIn its most recent funding round, the start-up attracted financing from billionaire Jeff Bezos and Ark Investment Management's Cathie Wood, as well as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and AI wunderkind OpenAI -- the start-up that arguably kicked off the AI revolution. Figure AI raised roughly $675 million, which valued the start-up at roughly $2.6 billion.\nFigure AI developed an autonomous robot that can help alleviate labor shortages in warehouses, transportation, and retail. Just last week, Figure released a video to demonstrate its progress. It says these fields have 7 million unfilled jobs and not enough workers to fill them. Figure recently announced its first commercial agreement to supply BMW with general-purpose robots for automotive production.\nIt might be difficult for investors to invest directly in Figure AI, as the start-up is privately held, but they can invest indirectly. For example, Microsoft is among the largest investors at $95 million, so buying shares of Microsoft will get you indirect exposure to Figure AI, though a very small amount.\nHowever, there are plenty of other reasons to buy Microsoft to take part in the AI revolution.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Apple antitrust suit mirrors strategy that beat Microsoft, but tech industry has changed",
        "Author": "  Mike Scarcella ",
        "Text": "By Mike Scarcella\n(Reuters) - The U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Apple draws on the watershed 1998 case that broke Microsoft's stranglehold on desktop software, but that may prove to be an imperfect blueprint for addressing smartphone competition.\nThe market for the iPhone today looks very different from the near-monopoly enjoyed by Microsoft's Windows operating system two decades ago, and the government as a result may face a tougher time in taking on Apple, legal experts said.\nThe Department of Justice, along with 15 state governments, accused Apple of unlawfully monopolizing the smartphone market through restrictions on app developers that curb choice and innovation, which it said forces consumers to pay higher prices.\nApple said the government is wrong on the facts and law.\nThe government has to prove that Apple\u2019s business practices were \u201cexclusionary\u201d and harmed consumers by degrading the quality of rival products, according to several legal experts.\nThe government accused Apple of suppressing technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones in five areas: so-called \"super apps,\" cloud streamed gaming apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets.\nOne example the government gave is familiar to anyone who texts from an iPhone to a user of an Android phone \u2014 the dreaded \"green bubble\" that results in hindrances such as grainy photos sent by text that don't apply when texting between two phones using Apple's iOS operating system.\nAntitrust enforcers said Apple was rapidly expanding its influence and power in industries including content creation and financial services.\nBy comparison, Microsoft was accused of abusing its market dominance to impede users from freely installing software on computers using the company\u2019s operating system.\nThat might sound similar to Apple's control over the app store, but legal experts said there are important differences.\nApple can contract with whom it wants and design products as it sees fit, legal experts said.\nIt becomes a problem when a company with monopoly power takes steps to lessen short-term profit in order to keep rivals out in the longer term, said Douglas Ross, an antitrust scholar at University of Washington\u2019s law school.\n\u201cThe fundamental assumption DOJ seems to have is that Apple must cooperate with its rivals to allow rivals to compete with Apple,\" Ross said. \"That has antitrust law backwards.\"\nMARKET SHARE\nMicrosoft was forced to open its operating system because it controlled 95% of desktop operating systems in the 1990s. By comparison, Apple had 55% of the North American market for smartphones at the end of September based on shipments, with the rest largely made up of phones using Google's Android operating system, according to Canalys, a market analysis firm.\nThe Justice Department seeks to define the market as that of smartphones in the United States. Apple representatives said they will try to persuade the court to define the market as the global smartphone market.\nApple and rival Samsung Electronics each had about a 20% market share globally in 2023, though Apple beat Samsung slightly on shipments, Canalys data showed.\nMicrosoft \"clearly was a monopolist and there were no effective competitors in the PC operating system space,\" Ross said. On the other hand, Android \u201cis very popular, especially in the rest of the world, and is a very effective competitor with iOS.\u201d\nRoss predicted it would be harder for the Justice Department to prevail against Apple than it was in the Microsoft case.\nSome of these allegations have been touched upon before in court.\nIn 2021, in an antitrust case brought by \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games, a federal judge found after a trial that Epic failed to prove that Apple users were \"locked-in\" to their iPhones and would not switch to Android devices.\nOf course, government attorneys know these differences and still brought the case.\nLegal experts said that reflects the viewpoint within the DOJ and the Biden Administration's Federal Trade Commission about challenging cases.\n\u201cThey are happy to take on the risk of a really big case,\u201d said plaintiffs' lawyer Patrick McGahan, whose firm is involved in litigation against Apple.\nLitigator Melissa Maxman in Washington said the Microsoft case changed the tech landscape and lauded the government's lawsuit as a step toward greater competition in the smartphone market.\n\"If you open up the market for other competitors to get in you will see prices go down and quality go up,\" Maxman said. \"That's exactly what was said in Microsoft \u2014 and guess what, it was true.\"\n(This story has been refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 11)\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by Tom Hals and Jamie Freed)\n"

The company\u2019s last quarterly results benefited from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +3.5% over the past year against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry\u2019s gain of +7.9%.

        "Author": "  John Csiszar ",
        "Text": "President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have already clinched the presidential nominations of their respective parties, making a rematch in the 2024 election a reality. Regardless of your own political views, as an investor, it\u2019s a good idea to take note of who the next president will be, as it can affect your investments.\nRead Next: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t SellLearn More: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024\nWhile the president doesn\u2019t directly control the stock market, everything from tax changes, trade policies and even casual comments made while on the political trail can affect stock prices. And when big tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft comprise nearly 13% of the market cap of the S&P 500 all on their own, how tech stocks react to the president can have a big effect on the overall market.\nHere\u2019s a look at how tech stocks have done under President Biden and his predecessor, and what the implications might be for Apple, Microsoft and other tech stocks if Biden doesn\u2019t win a second term.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nWhile the Nasdaq-100 index is often used as a proxy for the technology market, that index is also filled with non-tech stocks, such as healthcare and consumer products companies.\nTo compare the performance of tech stocks under the Trump and Biden presidencies, this analysis used the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which is an exchange-traded fund with the symbol XLK. This $65 billion ETF is a true tech index that only includes stocks in technology hardware, storage, and peripherals; software; communications equipment; semiconductors and semiconductor equipment; IT services; and electronic equipment, instruments and components.\nOn the day Trump was inaugurated, Jan. 20, 2017, the XLK closed at 45.92. When Biden took office four years later, on Jan. 20, 2021, the ETF closed at 128.26. That translates to a gain of 179%.\nDiscover More: 8 Best Cryptocurrencies To Invest In for 2024\nIn a nutshell, tech stocks performed much better during Trump\u2019s presidency than Biden\u2019s. Even though Biden still has 10 months left in his presidency, the performance gap of tech stocks between the two presidents is vast.\nSince the XLK closed at 128.26 on the day that Biden took office, it has posted a return of 64.5%, closing at 211.02 on Mar. 13, 2024. This means that the performance of the XLK under Trump was nearly triple what it earned so far under Biden.\nThe S&P 500 index is often used as a proxy for the stock market as a whole, but it\u2019s also heavily weighted towards technology. As of Feb. 20, 2024, the information technology sector comprised 29.4% of the entire S&P 500, more than the next two sectors \u2014 financials and healthcare \u2014 combined. Thus, analyzing the performance of the entire S&P 500 over a president\u2019s term incorporates how both tech stocks and the general market are doing.\nBiden\u2019s first term is not yet complete \u2014 he still has at least 10 months in office \u2014 but as of year-end 2023, the S&P 500 was up 25.9%. This makes it highly unlikely that his four-year performance will match Trump\u2019s, as the S&P 500 returned 67% under the former president.\nWho resides in the White House should just be one of the considerations you factor into your investment analysis when it comes to stocks like Apple and Microsoft. Other factors, like earnings, interest rates, inflation and geopolitical turmoil can all drive stock prices up or down even more than who the president is.\u00a0And let\u2019s not forget \u2014 both presidents have dealt with the ramifications of a pandemic.\nBut there\u2019s no denying that presidential policies can play a role as well. For example, according to Lee Munson, president of Portfolio Wealth Advisors, \u201cBiden has not been friendly to China, but Trump\u2019s going to be even worse \u2026 When you look at Trump, he\u2019s mercurial and could just cut off the tap \u2026 and tell Nvidia they can\u2019t sell anything.\u201d\nChina is important for American tech stocks both due to its demand and its role in the supply chain, so a president\u2019s policy towards China can move markets. However, again, this is just one factor that will affect big tech under the next president.\nWhile Trump might cause more trouble in China, TD Securities analysts note that corporate and personal taxes will likely remain higher under Biden than Trump. This could affect both demand for products and corporate earnings. Of course, this effect might be more than balanced out by falling inflation and interest rates, which may very well become tailwinds for stocks in the second half of 2024 and into 2025.\nThe best course of action is to continue to do your own research and due diligence and look to the long term. Apple and Microsoft will likely far outlast the next four years. If you believe in these specific stocks, tech stocks in general or the market at large, continuing to add to your positions \u2014 especially if they temporarily fall \u2014 is likely the best course of action.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nDownsizing for Retirement?

        "Author": "  Sheryl Estrada ",
        "Text": "Good morning. CoreWeave is positioning itself for the generative AI boom as a top cloud provider, and the Nvidia-backed startup just added a finance chief whose experience among the sector's biggest players can help his new firm, well, compete against the sector's biggest players.\nCoreWeave, which provides cloud GPUs crucial for high-powered AI computing, announced on Tuesday that Nitin Agrawal is taking over as CFO. He previously was VP of finance for Google Cloud.\nWhy join the startup? \u201cCoreWeave is filling a void in the high-performance computing space left unaddressed by the legacy cloud providers,\u201d Agrawal told me. \u201cI think we have a unique opportunity to build the next generation of cloud infrastructure alongside the best team in the industry.\"\nAgrawal replaces Evan Meagher, who stepped down, according to the company. At Google, Agrawal said he and his team helped bring Google Cloud to profitability and developed its AI and machine-learning investment strategy. Before that, he served as CFO of Mapbox and held leadership roles at Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.\n\u201cAll of those roles have helped me learn the intricacies of operating a cloud business at scale and scaling new businesses in high-growth environments,\u201d Agrawal said.\nNew Jersey-based CoreWeave was cofounded in 2017 by current CEO Michael Intrator; Brannin McBee, the firm's chief development officer; and Brian Venturo, the chief strategy officer. It began as a crypto-mining company that used GPUs to verify blockchain transactions before pivoting to AI.\nThe startup announced in December it closed a $642 million round led by Fidelity Management & Research Co., with additional participation from Investment Management Corporation of Ontario, Jane Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Nat Friedman & Daniel Gross, Goanna Capital, Zoom Ventures and others. (That transaction values the company at $7 billion, but the firm declined to comment on that figure when asked by Fortune.)\nCoreWeave announced in August that it had secured $2.3 billion in debt financing led by Magnetar Capital and Blackstone, with participation from Coatue, DigitalBridge Credit, and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, PIMCO, and Carlyle. The company also announced in April that it had raised $221 million in Series B funding led by Magnetar Capital, with contributions from Nvidia, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, and a month later secured $200 million in a Series B extension, also led by Magnetar Capital.\nCoreWeave uses Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips for data centers, and for building out data centers for AI computing, including a cloud-native AI supercomputer.\nBut what actually separates CoreWeave's AI infrastructure from that of competitors? It supports \u201cthe most demanding workloads, using purpose-built cloud infrastructure, to perform at the highest possible level for GPU-accelerated compute workloads, rather than using commoditized infrastructure,\" Agrawal explained. \u201cThat helps it to deliver both speed and reliability.\u201d\nAs CFO, Agrawal said he's focused on sustaining profitable growth, and \"the best way to accomplish it is by keeping customer priorities at the forefront\" and \"disciplined execution.\u201d\nGiven everything he's helped build, and everything he still plans to build, I asked Agrawal to share his favorite piece of career advice. He offered two.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it's the people that matter, so make sure you take people along with you in your journey,\" he said. And you should \u201calways keep a healthy disregard for the impossible while being grounded in reality.\u201d\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nMar\u00eda Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today\u2019s newsletter.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, Microsoft has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Microsoft shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 41% to 45%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Microsoft's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\nOwing to the size of Microsoft, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.1b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.03% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Microsoft's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Microsoft's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Microsoft that you need to be mindful of.\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nTotal S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up +2.4% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues. This follows the +6.7% earnings growth on +3.8% higher revenues in 2023 Q4.\nAs was the case in the preceding two quarters, the Tech sector remains a key growth driver in 2024 Q1. Had it not been for the robust Tech sector earnings growth, total earnings for the rest of the index would be modestly in negative territory.\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings season has not officially ended, as 7 S&P 500 member companies have yet to report quarterly results.

Excluding the Mag 7 contribution, 2024 Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -3.3% from the year-earlier period (vs. +2.4% growth otherwise).\nAs we gear up for the March-quarter reporting cycle, whose early results will start coming out in the next few days, it is useful to summarize what we learned in the Q4 earnings season (only seven companies are still to report Q4 results at this stage).\nWhile no major surprises emerged from the Q4 earnings season, the earnings and revenue growth pace showed modest acceleration from recent periods, and the tone and substance of management guidance remained largely favorable.\nThe Tech sector was a material contributor to the aggregate growth picture in Q4. The sector struggled in the post-COVID period, resuming its traditional growth-driver status just in 2023 Q3. This came after six consecutive quarters of underwhelming Tech sector earnings growth, starting in 2022 Q1 when the sector was a drag on the aggregate growth picture.\nEarnings growth for the S&P 500 index would have been modestly in negative territory on an ex-Tech basis.\nThe \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks, including Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Nvidia NVDA, were again significant contributors to growth in 2023 Q4. Please note that two of the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; these two are Amazon (part of the Zacks Retail sector) and Tesla (part of the Zacks Autos sector).\nGiven the expected moderation in the U.S. economy\u2019s growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down. But the +4.9% revenue growth expectation is hardly aggressive, considering that the U.S. economy produced a nominal GDP growth rate in excess of +6% last year.\nThe rest of the 2024 earnings growth is coming from margin expansion, with 2024 net margins for the index going up to +12.4% from last year\u2019s 11.7%. Embedded in this margin expectation is the view that the inflation cycle has run its course, with easing cost pressures letting net margins return to the 2022 level.\nWe don\u2019t see this margin (or revenue) outlook as unreasonable or out-of-sync with the economic ground reality.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia stock rose 239% on the back of incredible demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia is now worth more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.\u00a0Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) are also members of the $1 trillion club, and each company is working on AI in its own unique way.\nBut I think AI could soon propel Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to a $1 trillion valuation, too. It operates industry-leading AI data center infrastructure, and the company is building capacity at a record pace because it simply can't keep up with demand. As of this writing, Oracle is valued at $350 billion, so investors who buy the stock today will see roughly a 185% gain if the company joins the $1 trillion club.\nFounded in 1977, Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. It developed revolutionary database management software back then, before helping its business customers prepare for the internet age in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The company created Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 and has since delivered hundreds of digital services to those businesses to migrate their operations online.\nNow, using Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs), Oracle is focused on delivering the best data center infrastructure for AI workloads. Three months ago, Oracle told investors it was expanding 66 of its existing data center regions and building 100 more to meet demand.\nChairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology allows businesses to develop generative AI models twice as fast and for half the cost of other cloud providers. As a result, demand for its latest Gen2 Cloud capacity is skyrocketing. Oracle is able to keep costs down because its data centers rely on automation, which means there is little difference in operating costs between running 10 data centers and running 100. That also enables the company to build and scale them quickly.\nIn a conference call with investors for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), CEO Safra Catz said Oracle has at least 40 new AI bookings worth more than $1 billion each that haven't even come online yet.\u00a0In other words, they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during Q3, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%. While that sounds like a sluggish growth rate, revenue for OCI surged 49% to $1.8 billion, and revenue for Gen2 Cloud specifically (within OCI) grew by 53%.\nWhile OCI only accounts for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue right now, those growth rates will ensure it becomes a much larger piece of the pie in the near future.\nOracle's total AI bookings across its business topped a record $80 billion in Q3, marking a 29% increase from the year-ago period. As you can see, bookings grew four times faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which is evidence of the enormous demand for computing capacity the company is struggling to fill.\nAt the bottom line, Oracle's Q3 earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85, which also outpaced revenue growth. It was thanks, in part, to careful cost management, with operating expenses increasing just 4% year over year. But it was also thanks to a substantial increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side, which is a natural consequence of scale. Oracle expects continued improvement as more of its new data centers come online.\nAI is the main point of focus for Oracle at the moment, but there's another opportunity worth mentioning. The company now has two Oracle Alloy data center regions online, which organizations can use to deliver their own cloud services to their customers -- without having to manage the infrastructure.\nOracle has planned five more Alloy data center regions, meaning capacity could soon triple. It's just another example of this company's long-standing commitment to innovation.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is on track to generate $53.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending May 31), placing its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6. That falls between the valuations of other cloud giants, like Amazon (P/S ratio of 3.1) and Microsoft (P/S ratio of 13.2).\nAssuming Oracle's P/S ratio remains constant, the company would have to generate $151.5 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could get there within a decade if its revenue grows by 11% annually.\nWhile Oracle is growing more slowly on a quarterly basis right now, its revenue increased by 22% last fiscal year. Plus, Ellison believes OCI revenue will increase by more than 50% for years to come, which could drive an acceleration in the company's top line overall as the segment grows larger.\nRemember, Oracle is in the process of more than doubling its data center footprint, and its bookings just soared by 29% in a single quarter. Bookings are expected to convert into revenue eventually, implying revenue growth will likely accelerate in the near future.\nAI is the greatest financial opportunity Oracle has ever pursued, and I think it's the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 7, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ and CBIZ CBZ.\nMany similarities exist between the internet boom of the late 1990s and the AI revolution that is taking place today, including blistering growth, soaring stock prices, and lots of hype. However, significant differences exist as well. For example, Wall Street and the biggest AI winners thus far are already proven companies with massive cash hoards and well-established businesses like Microsoft and Alphabet.\nAt the same time, the AI buildout has buoyed the stock prices of these companies and led to robust earnings, it\u2019s difficult to move the needle on a multi-trillion-dollar business like GOOGL or MSFT. Furthermore, many of these companies have broad and diverse businesses that stretch beyond AI.\nSeveral data points suggest that the AI boom is in its 1995 moment rather than its 1999 moment. For instance, stock valuations are relatively inexpensive (at least compared to 99\u2019), and the Nasdaq 100 ETF is just now breaking out to all-time highs. Still, the most significant divergence between then and now is the IPO market. In 2023, there were 154 IPOs on the U.S. stock market. Conversely, in 1999, a staggering 473 IPOs went public. Quite the difference!\nIPOs, or Initial Public Offerings, serve as the lifeblood of the stock market by infusing it with new, publicly traded companies. These offerings provide opportunities for investors to buy shares in promising, often innovative enterprises, fostering market growth. In the late 1990s, the IPOs provided the most significant gains because many were agile, had blistering growth expectations, and were pure plays in the space.\nObviously, investors cannot change the fact that there are few pure-play AI avenues on Wall Street. Presently, they can invest in the aforementioned dominant big tech juggernauts.\nNevertheless, the best investors prepare for and study non-public companies ahead of time. They watch early-stage innovators early so that they fully understand the industry and can pounce when the opportunity comes.\nAn example of an AI start-up worth watching is Propense.ai. Today, Propense.ai announced a successful seed funding round. The Miami-based company combines AI technology with data science, user psychology, human behavior, and industry insights to anticipate client needs. Propense.ai streamlines the sales experience for accounting and legal professionals by providing them with highly probable cross-selling recommendations for existing customers, making it the first platform of its kind to maximize revenue opportunities for professional services firms.\nIn recent comments, Propense.ai CEO and Co-Founder Timothy Keith said,\n\u201cThe most successful professional service firms are actively engaged in adding service offerings to help their clients, but often struggle with educating their teams on when to offer new services. Propense.ai solves this challenge, elevating client satisfaction while also driving revenue. Behavior is one of the most difficult factors to change in the workplace, especially when sales professionals are expected to cross-sell services they don\u2019t understand nearly as well as their core lines of business. That\u2019s where Propense.ai and its revenue automation capabilities come into play. Using generative AI, accounting and legal professionals can propel new revenue by anticipating and supporting their client\u2019s needs ahead of time.\u201d\nThe best ideas are ones that solve issues. Propense.ai is an example of a company that solves the issue of employee education while adding efficiency and revenue growth. Though the company is still young, it already counts public companies such as public consulting juggernaut CBIZ as clients.\nWhile the AI buildout is in motion, Wall Street and the AI industry have yet to experience the IPO frenzy that took place in the mid-to-late 1990s. Though many private AI start-ups still need to be bigger to enter public markets, I expect that will change in the coming years. In the interim, investors should take the time to investigate and study up-and-coming AI companies such as Propense.ai to educate themselves about the industry and prepare for the eventual influx of IPOs. These IPOs will likely provide the best opportunities because of their industry tailwind, high-growth potential, and asymmetric investment potential.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 20, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Carlisle Companies CSL, Microsoft MSFT, W.W. Grainger GWW and Adobe ADBE.\nIf you are looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks offering the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.\nThe strategy helps investors gain exposure to undervalued stocks with impressive prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best value and growth investing. Carlisle Companies, Microsoft, W.W. Grainger and Adobe are some GARP stocks that hold promise.\nThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.\nGrowth Metrics\nA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 30% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.\nAnother metric that growth and GARP investors consider is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.\nValue Metrics\nGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics \u2014 the price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.\nUsing the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.\nHere are four of the six stocks that made it through the screen:\nCarlisle is engaged in the designing, manufacturing and selling of a wide range of roofing and waterproofing products, engineered products and finishing equipment. CSL currently flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nCarlisle has gained 68.1% year to date. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.55%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSL's 2024 earnings has moved 2.3% north to $18.44 per share over the past 30 days.\nMicrosoft is a broad-based technology provider whose offerings comprise operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools and video games. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nMicrosoft has gained 54.5% over a year. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.82%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft\u2019s fiscal 2024 earnings has moved 0.3% north to $11.63 per share in the past 30 days.\nW.W. Grainger is a broad-line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating products and services primarily in North America, Japan and the U.K. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nW.W. Grainger has gained 49% over a year. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.5%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2024 earnings has moved 0.03% north to $39.22 per share over the past 30 days.\nAdobe is a diversified software company that offers a wide range of products and services through the Software-as-a-Service model, managed services model, and term subscription and pay-per-use models. ADBE currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nAdobe has gained 41.6% over a year. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.03%, on average.

        "Author": "  Foo Yun Chee ",
        "Text": "(This March 14 story has been corrected to say 15 million euros and not 15 billion euros, in paragraph 11)\nBy Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet unit Google enjoys a competitive edge in generative artificial intelligence due to its trove of data and AI-optimised chips, Microsoft has told EU antitrust regulators, underscoring the rivalry between the two tech giants.\nThe comments by Microsoft were in response to a consultationlaunched by the European Commission in January on the level of competition in generative AI.\nThe growing popularity of generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts and is exemplified by Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's chatbot Gemini, has triggered concerns about misinformation and fake news.\n\"Today, only one company - Google - is vertically integrated in a manner that provides it with strength and independence at every AI layer from chips to a thriving mobile app store. Everyone else must rely on partnerships to innovate and compete,\" Microsoft said in its report to the Commission.\nIt said Google's self-supply AI semiconductors will give it a competitive advantage for the years to come, while its large sets of proprietary data from Google Search Index and YouTube enable it to train its large language model Gemini.\n\"YouTube provides an unparalleled set of video content; it hosts an estimated 14 billion videos. Google has access to such content; but other AI developers do not,\" Microsoft said.\nIt said AI-powered voice assistants such as Google's Google Assistant and Apple's Siri give both companies an advantage.\n\"They are well positioned to evolve and leverage their respective existing voice assistants into leadership positions in generative AI. New entrants and competitors of Google and Apple will not enjoy the same advantages,\" Microsoft said.\nMicrosoft, whose more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI is now in EU antitrust regulators' crosshairs, also sought to fend off regulatory worries about such partnerships between Big Tech and start-ups.\n\"All of these start-ups relied on different forms of investments and partnerships that enabled them to enter and expand in the space,\" it said.\nIt pointed to Anthropic which has Google and Amazon as investors, France's Mistral in which Microsoft has invested 15 million euros and Canada's Cohere which has Salesforce and Nvidia as investors.\n\"Encouraging pro-competitive partnerships in the AI space is an effective way to prevent companies from becoming vertically integrated in a manner that would result in an anticompetitive advantage,\" Microsoft said.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n"

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The chatbot wars have arrived, and there are plenty of companies vying to dominate the space. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has invested $13 billion into OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. \nThe tech company has been bolstering its Bing browser and Office applications with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in an effort to win over more customers and generate an early lead.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), through its Google segment, has long been a rival of Microsoft, and it has been trying to keep up, launching its chatbot Bard last year, which ended up morphing into Gemini this year.\nGoogle's rollout hasn't exactly been smooth, however, as the company has now fumbled multiple times with its AI, the latest problem being that it is generating inaccurate images.\nBut Microsoft hasn't exactly been unscathed in this period of early growth, either. It, too, might have problems with its AI, particularly with its image generator.\nAn engineer at Microsoft, Shane Jones, says he has been testing the company's AI image generator via Copilot Designer, which uses OpenAI technology. And he has been so concerned with the images that the company's AI image generator created that he has sent a letter to the company's board and alerted the Federal Trade Commission.\nHe said he believes it runs afoul of the company's AI responsibility principles, claiming that it created controversial images, including ones that were violent, sexual, involved underage drinking, and which also appeared to violate copyright laws.\nAI-image generators can create virtually anything out of just text inputs. The concept involves a user entering some text and the AI then creating an image based on that.\nBut with the technology in its early stages, it appears that not enough safeguards and restrictions have been put into place to prevent a wide range of potentially disturbing images from being generated. And Jones is also concerned that there isn't a way to easily report and rectify these issues.\nThe public is likely more aware of the well-publicized issues relating Google's AI chatbot Gemini. The issues have been concerning enough that the company decided to pull the AI image generator last month, with the promise of relaunching it after addressing the issues.\nCritics have accused Gemini of getting images wrong, especially when it comes to generating pictures of historical figures where the race, ethnicity, and gender might not appear to be accurate.\nCEO Sundar Pichai admits that the AI needs to be fixed, but also reminds users that the technology is in its early stages. \"No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry's development, but we know the bar is high for us,\" Pichai said.\nUnfortunately, this is not new territory for Google. Last year, in Bard's first public appearance, it made a factual mistake in a promotional video.\nIt might be tempting to assume that after two blunders, Google's chatbot isn't going to catch up to OpenAI and Microsoft. But AI chatbots are likely to go through multiple iterations and enhancements over the years, and trying to declare a winner at this point would be premature at best.\nAlthough Microsoft has the early advantage thanks to its investment in OpenAI, by no means does that guarantee success for the company. And the concerns relating to its AI image-generating capabilities are a reminder that investors and consumers should expect bumps along the way, particularly when it comes to new products and services.\nInvestors are clearly more willing to pay a premium for Microsoft's stock than they are for Alphabet's, with the former trading at 37 times its trailing earnings and the latter trading at just 24. Alphabet's AI has struggled out of the gate, and that's likely a big reason why its valuation is lower than Microsoft's.\nAlphabet, however, still has a strong business, which generated $74 billion in profit last year on revenue of more than $307 billion. With solid assets such as YouTube and Google Search, AI can enhance those products even further. Investors should be careful not to assume that Alphabet can't recover from this recent bad press.\nMicrosoft might be the more polished AI stock to buy right now, but Alphabet could end up being the better investment. It has a lower valuation and is a bit of an underdog right now, so the bar is set fairly low. And with a good track record for innovation and growing its business, Alphabet could make for an underrated AI stock to own for the long haul.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.
