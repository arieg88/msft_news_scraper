        "Title": "The cold war between Google and Microsoft has 'gone hot'",
        "Author": " Alexis Keenan    \u00b7 Senior Legal Reporter",
        "Text": "A long-standing feud between Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) is spilling into public view once again.\nThe latest shot from Google came in a complaint filed with the European Commission Wednesday, accusing Microsoft of violating the European Union\u2019s antitrust law.\nGoogle said in a document provided to Yahoo Finance that Microsoft illegally leveraged its dominant enterprise server software \u201cWindows Server\u201d licenses to force customers to stick with Microsoft for cloud computing.\nMicrosoft predicted Google would \"fail\" in this instance, saying it had already settled similar concerns raised by European cloud providers.\n\"Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\nThe new dispute demonstrates \"this is a cold war that's gone hot,\" Adam Kovacevich, CEO and Founder of the tech policy advocacy group Chamber of Progress, told Yahoo Finance.\nThe two tech giants have spent the last two decades battling for supremacy in technologies ranging from online search and cloud computing to the markets for operating systems, gaming software, online advertising \u2014 and now artificial intelligence, or AI.\nThe feud began in the first decade after Microsoft settled a landmark antitrust case brought by the US Justice Department alleging it boxed out rivals by making its browser free and the default on its dominant Windows operating system.\nA 2002 settlement opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market and created an opportunity for Google, then a startup formed by Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to begin its period of meteoric growth in the 2000s.\nMicrosoft defended its reestablished territory in a series of videos first released in 2011, in which Microsoft skewered Google with parodies suggesting that Google\u2019s competing Gmail service, Chrome browser, and accompanying software lacked quality and privacy.\nA video titled \u201cGmail Man\u201d questioned Google's ethics by accusing it of mining every word within its Gmail customers' private emails in order to target them with advertisements.\nIn other videos titled \"Scroogled\" and \"Googlighting\" \u2014 a spoof on the 1980s hit television series \"Moonlighting\" \u2014 Microsoft questioned whether consumers should trust Google with handling their private information.\nIn 2016, the companies entered into a ceasefire with an agreement to end regulatory complaints against each other globally as two new CEOs \u2014 Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella \u2014 took over.\nThe pact came to an end in 2021 as regulators in the US and EU stepped up pressure on both companies, and Microsoft complained that Google used unfair tactics to compete in online search and advertising.\nThings really got uncomfortable last year during a high-profile antitrust trial that pitted Google against the US Justice Department \u2014 a case that alleged Google illegally monopolized the online search engine market and had echoes of the case the DOJ filed against Microsoft in the 1990s.\nThe most prominent witness to testify against Google was Nadella, who did not hesitate to take a shot at his rival while on the stand.\n\u201cYou get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google,\u201d Nadella said, emphasizing Google\u2019s overwhelming dominance in the search engine market.\nNadella said Microsoft\u2019s own search engine, Bing, failed to gain traction because Google had negotiated for Google Search to get default placement on browsers, desktops, and mobile devices like Apple's iPhones and iPads and Android-based smartphones made by Samsung and others.\nNadella went on to describe the imbalance as a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d that he worried would intensify with the development of AI.\nGoogle lost the case in a judge\u2019s ruling that labeled its search business an illegal monopoly. The resolution is now pending a remedies phase that could result in a breakup of Google\u2019s empire.\nMicrosoft certainly had a lot to gain from a Google defeat, Kovacevich said.\n\u201cThey were probably the main instigator of the US Justice Department's antitrust suit over Google,\u201d Kovacevich said. \u201cAnd the guilty verdict against Google probably stands to benefit Microsoft's Bing most of anyone.\u201d\nMicrosoft is taking a similar approach in yet another antitrust lawsuit against Google that is still in its initial trial phase. It argues there that Google\u2019s control of online advertising technologies has harmed the success of its Bing browser.\nIt's unknown if the EU will take up Google's most recent attack against Microsoft's cloud computing rules.\nGoogle is arguing that Microsoft imposed a 400% markup on customers to migrate their Windows Server licenses to a competing cloud service, while customers who chose Microsoft's cloud services, Azure, could migrate for \u201cessentially nothing.\u201d\nIn making its case, Google is using the same sort of \"bundling\" or \"tying\" claims used in the 1998 case against Microsoft brought by the DOJ.\nBack then, US prosecutors alleged that Microsoft illegally monopolized the market for personal computing operating systems by using its Windows operating system to give away its browser, Internet Explorer, for free.\nThe move bundled the browser along with Windows, eventually putting rival browser Netscape Navigator out of business.\nMicrosoft was eventually required to open up Windows to third party software, which paved the way for companies including Google to \"interoperate\" or run their browser and search software using Microsoft-powered computers.\nNow, in the market for cloud computing, Google is arguing that Microsoft leveraged \"dominance in one market to prevent competition on the merits in a separate, unrelated market,\" according to the document shared with Yahoo Finance.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is pouring more of its AI-powered Copilot technology into its Microsoft 365 productivity products, including Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The updates, which include the ability to use Copilot to draft PowerPoint presentations and a feature that prioritizes your emails in Outlook, are a part of what the tech giant refers to as its Copilot Wave 2 rollout.\nIn addition to the improvements to its Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft also announced a new collaborative tool called Copilot Pages, which lets teams of workers access, edit, and manipulate data on a single page using information pulled from Copilot.\nThe company also debuted a new agent builder option that lets users easily create Copilot-powered agents, AI assistants designed to automate and executive business processes.\nThe moves are all a part of Microsoft\u2019s broader efforts to infuse its vast portfolio of business software products with AI capabilities as it seeks to outpace rivals in the space ranging from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Salesforce (CRM) and monetize its enormous investments in AI technology.\nMicrosoft says the number of customers using Copilot increased more than 60% quarter over quarter and that the number of people who use it daily at work doubled. What\u2019s more, the Windows maker says Vodafone is purchasing 68,000 Copilot licenses for its 100,000 employees after it found that the software helped workers save an average of three hours per week per person.\nThe new Copilot features for Microsoft\u2019s 365 apps are all designed to help improve worker efficiency, whether that means tracking meeting transcripts and chats to make it easier to catch up or quickly adding references to documents, PDFs, and emails in a Word document.\nThe Copilot agent builder for Copilot Studio, meanwhile, is designed to help put together an AI-powered agent that fits your company\u2019s needs without needing much technical know-how.\n\u201cOne of the things which we heard very consistently was ... it's not one size fits all when it comes to Copilot,\u201d Charles Lamanna, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot, told Yahoo Finance.\n\u201cIf you have this company and this company, say, Disney versus Novartis, what they want to do in Microsoft 365 with Copilot is going to be slightly different. They have different data sources, they have different workflows, they have different processes. They have just \u2026 different ways of working.\u201d\nThat\u2019s where Microsoft\u2019s agent builder comes in. Say, for example, you want to make it easier for new employees to better understand their health benefits. You can use Copilot Studio to tell an agent to answer questions about your company\u2019s healthcare offerings and point it to any relevant documents.\nWhen a worker uses the agent, it will automatically pull data from those documents, providing them with the information they need without having to scour multiple microsites and digital pamphlets.\n\u201cEveryone in a company will be able to create agents and to use agents,\u201d Lamanna said.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot software is a major part of its broader push into the generative AI space, which includes investing in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and is at least part of the reason the company\u2019s stock price is up more than 30% over the last 12 months. Rival and Google parent Alphabet\u2019s stock is up 14% in the same period.\nDuring its most recent earnings report, Microsoft announced that its Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, which includes Azure services, was $28.5 billion. That was just short of Wall Street\u2019s expectation of $28.7 billion. And while that was a 19% year-over-year revenue increase, investors reacted negatively to the news, sending shares lower following the earnings announcement.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is set to finally release its long-delayed Recall feature for Windows 11. The software option, which the company debuted back in May, saves screenshots of virtually everything you do on your computer allowing you to search for and interact with them later on.\nFor instance, if you were booking a hotel room but forgot the website you were using or need to find an old document and can\u2019t remember what you named it, you can use Recall to describe the site or document and it will find them for you by searching through those screenshots.\nIt\u2019s a helpful concept, but security researchers quickly raised concerns about the potential for hackers or malware software to gain access to those screenshots, steal users' data, and view some of their most sensitive information.\nIn response, Microsoft put the feature on hold and instead chose to launch its Copilot+ PCs without Recall. Now, after reworking the software, Microsoft says it\u2019s ready to go and that users\u2019 data will be as secure as it could possibly be. Microsoft has yet to reveal the official launch date however.\n\u201cI think this is really a statement from Microsoft saying we're going to put our full power into making AI secure,\u201d David Weston, Microsoft vice president of Enterprise and OS Security, told Yahoo Finance.\nOne of the biggest changes to Recall is that it is now opt-in, meaning if you want to use it, you\u2019ll need to select a specific box that says as much. Recall was previously enabled by default.\nMicrosoft also says that users' screenshots, or Snapshots, as the company calls them, are encrypted and that the only way to access them is using Microsoft\u2019s Windows Hello, which requires you to authenticate that you are who you say you are using your laptop\u2019s fingerprint reader or facial recognition capabilities.\nIf a user\u2019s laptop is infected with malware, Microsoft says it uses rate-limiting and anti-hammering to prevent the malicious software from accessing your information. Rate-limiting and anti-hammering detect when someone or something is trying to log into a program too many times in a short amount of time and require them to reauthenticate via their fingerprint or face ID.\nRead more: How to create a strong password and protect your financial accounts\nMicrosoft also says that Recall is now using the company\u2019s Purview software, which helps protect enterprise systems, to ensure the platform doesn\u2019t save things like users\u2019 passwords, national ID numbers, or credit card numbers. According to Weston, Purview contains a database that allows it to recognize what those types of numbers might look like and prevents Recall from capturing images of them.\nWhat\u2019s more, Microsoft says users will be able to choose what kind of screenshots Recall can take. You can, for instance, tell Recall not to capture Snapshots of specific apps or web browsers or certain types of documents. You can also fully disable or uninstall Recall if you don\u2019t want it on your computer at all.\nAdditionally, the software will recognize when you\u2019re using private browsing or incognito mode with your web browser and stop capturing images of what you\u2019re looking at.\nTo prove its security chops, Microsoft says it conducted months of security reviews using its Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering team and third-party security experts to ensure the software is safe.\nRecall is one of the marquee features of Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PCs, which is a designation for laptops that meet a specific threshold of power and capabilities and are running the latest version of Windows 11. Launching the software without Recall, however, meant that while users still had access to the Copilot assistant software, they weren\u2019t able to access one of the capabilities that Microsoft hoped would be a major selling point for its AI push.\nNow Microsoft just has to ensure the software is as secure as it says.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is investing heavily in building out data centers to support the growth of its cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) operations. Those facilities require tremendous power, especially when used for AI. For example, AI applications like ChatGPT require 10 times the electricity to process a search query compared to a typical Google search.\nThat's leading Microsoft to secure power to support its growth ambitions. It recently signed a deal to buy nuclear energy produced by Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG). It also signed a massive renewable energy deal with Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP). These agreements will help ensure Microsoft has the power it needs to thrive in the future.\nMicrosoft recently signed a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with leading nuclear energy producer Constellation Energy. The deal will help launch the Crane Clean Energy Center by restarting Three Mile Island Unit 1. The company had shut down that unit five years ago for operational and economic reasons. It will now bring it back online to supply Microsoft's data centers with carbon-free energy for decades to come.\nConstellation Energy expects the restarted nuclear-generating unit, renamed after its former CEO, to begin producing power by 2028. It will mark the country's first-ever restart of a previously retired nuclear power plant. The company plans to invest about $1.6 billion to bring the plant back online.\nIt would have the capacity to generate 835 megawatts (MW) of carbon-free electricity and could operate through at least 2054. The 20-year agreement for capacity at the revamped Crane Clean Energy Center is the largest-ever PPA signed by Constellation Energy. It will supply the power company with steady income for the next two decades.\nThree Mile Island Unit 1 is next to the notorious Unit 2, which shut down in 1979 after a partial meltdown. That accident, the most famous one in the country, didn't impact Unit 1. Constellation Energy won't restart that second unit.\nConstellation Energy isn't the only company benefiting from Microsoft's need for power. The tech titan signed a massive collaboration agreement with Brookfield Renewable in May. The deal will see the leading global renewable energy producer deliver over 10.5 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable power capacity by 2030.\nThat agreement is the largest corporate PPA ever signed, nearly eight times bigger than the prior record. It provides a pathway for Brookfield to build and deliver 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity in the U.S. and Europe to support Microsoft's cloud and AI expansions while helping it achieve its goal of having 100% of its power come from zero-carbon energy by 2030. It builds on their existing agreements where Brookfield is supplying Microsoft with nearly 1 GW of power capacity.\nWhile that deal initially covers renewable energy in the U.S. and Europe, it could expand to other regions, like Asia-Pacific, India, and Latin America, where Brookfield also has a strong operating presence. Further, it will focus beyond wind and solar to include new or impactful carbon-free energy-generation technologies.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's support for nuclear energy could also benefit Brookfield. While it doesn't operate nuclear power facilities, it has investments in Westinghouse, a leading global nuclear services business. Westinghouse could help restart dormant nuclear power plants and build new nuclear capacity, such as small modular reactors.\nThe next two decades will be an unprecedented period for electricity buildout globally to support the growth of cloud computing, AI, electric vehicles, and other demand drivers. Microsoft is ensuring it stays ahead of this curve by grabbing as much power as possible to support its growth ambitions. That's fueling growth for Constellation Energy and Brookfield Renewable, which should expand briskly for years to come, making them great stocks to buy for those seeking to capitalize on the coming power boom. \nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is bringing major updates to its Copilot artificial intelligence platform for Windows, expanding the software's capabilities with a number of new features, and introducing the ability to speak directly to the AI helper.\nThe announcements, which the company made at a press event at its Microsoft Experience Center in New York on Tuesday, also include a context-aware Click to Do option that provides you with tools and actions to complete tasks related to what you see on your screen, a refreshed version of Windows Search, the ability to upscale your old photos to up to 8K resolution, and an AI-powered edit tool for erasing or adding objects to your images.\nThe company also said it's working on a feature called Copilot Vision, which is able to view your Edge browser screen and understand questions you ask about what you're looking at.\nAll of these options come as Microsoft continues its AI push on both the consumer and enterprise sides of its business. The company launched its first wave of Copilot+ PCs in May, including its own Surface line of laptops and devices from partner companies including Dell, HP, and Lenovo.\nShares of Microsoft were off more than 1% on the day, in line with Tuesday's broader market trend.\nIn addition to its announcements on Tuesday, Microsoft also said it's preparing to roll out its previously delayed Recall feature for Windows 11. Recall is designed to capture screenshots of what you're doing on your computer, providing you with a kind of continuously updated visual library of the apps you've used and websites you've visited.\nSecurity researchers, however, objected to the app saying hackers could exploit it to steal user information. Microsoft has since updated the offering, saying it's improved its overall security and made it an opt-in service.\nThe new Click to Do feature provides you with a context-aware set of options to complete tasks for what you're looking at on your screen. Press the Windows key, and then click the mouse, and you'll get a pop-up toolbox that will let you do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing. Microsoft says the feature will also work with text, helping you to rewrite or summarize what you've written.\nThe improved Windows Search feature now allows you to search for files and photos using descriptions of what they may include rather than their actual names. So, if you're looking for a file about an article you've written about new Microsoft features, you can search using something like \"new Microsoft updates\" and Search should pull up the right file.\nMicrosoft's improved photo editing and image upscaling will help you take out unwanted objects from your photos, while Super resolution in Photos will improve the look of your older images, so you can grab those old shots you took on your first-generation iPhone and make them look like you shot them on the latest iPhone 16.\nThen there's Copilot Vision, which Microsoft says will only be available to a select set of Pro subscribers through Copilot Labs for now. During a pre-recorded demo, Microsoft showed how a user could speak to Copilot about shows they might want to watch while browsing the Rotten Tomatoes web page. The AI is able to look at the screen and make suggestions about what it sees, explaining to the user why they might enjoy certain TV shows or movies.\nMicrosoft says nothing is saved from your conversations with Copilot Vision after you end the session and the company won't train its AI using your chats.\nAll of these updates come ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. Adding new AI features just as PC sales are beginning to take off again should help drive consumers to Microsoft Copilot+ PCs. But Apple's (AAPL) own Apple Intelligence is also set to land on its Mac line of computers in the coming months, setting up an AI showdown for both company's laptop and desktop businesses.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "I loved my job at Microsoft, but I had to resign on principle. Here\u2019s why",
        "Author": "  Holly Alpine ",
        "Text": "In Microsoft\u2019s own words on climate change, \u201cthose of us who can afford to move faster and go further should do so.\u201d So why is Microsoft going backwards?\nNo matter how we vote, what generation we belong to, or what part of the world we live in, many of us have sweltered this summer. During one week in June, the world broke 1,400 temperature records\u2014with 1,300 people dying in the Hajj heatwave alone. That should remind us of our shared reality: Climate issues are among our most urgent challenges worldwide.\nI am a Seattle-based, 32-year-old, plant-powered mountain athlete and climate activist who resigned earlier this year from Microsoft, a company hailed by one media outlet as the best ESG company of 2023. Now, I am co-leading a campaign to advocate for effective policy, inform standards, and build a cross-industry coalition to drive change. Before you dismiss me as an idealist tech worker disconnected from our oil-dependent economy, I want you to hear the backstory. \nI painfully quit a job I loved leading multiple global sustainability programs primarily because, after years of organizing internally to make change, I could no longer reconcile Microsoft\u2019s strong public environmental sustainability stance with its assistance to the oil and gas industry\u2014a partnership that was\u00a0dramatically increasing global emissions. I realized that internal pressure alone wasn\u2019t going to shift the incentives; the public and shareholders needed to know what was happening.\nCorporations play a role in many of the greatest challenges of our time, and many have made strong pledges around labor and human rights, conflict minerals, or privacy. Over almost a decade at Microsoft, the challenge I devoted my career to was environmental sustainability. I was in good company, with Microsoft\u2019s laudable sustainability commitments backed by thousands of world-class employees and programs. \nMicrosoft is extremely outspoken on the ethics of technology and sustainability. President Brad Smith has ardently emphasized the need to control whether technology is used \"for good or ill,\" and has made strong statements on Microsoft\u2019s role in climate change. Similarly, CEO Satya Nadella has stated to shareholders, \"As we pursue our mission, we also recognize our enormous responsibility to ensure the technology we build benefits everyone on the planet, including the planet itself.\" \nI\u2019m proud that the employee group I cofounded played a part in strengthening Microsoft\u2019s environmental pledges. But even as the tech giant promulgates the urgency to act on climate for \u201ca shared future,\u201d its core business activities directly contribute to the climate crisis.\nAs outlined in an explosive new article in the Atlantic, in truth, Microsoft's advanced technology is enabling a substantial increase in global emissions. The company dominates as the largest cloud provider of advanced technology (e.g. AI) to the fossil fuel industry, surpassing all other vendors combined. Its digital technology is contributing to staggering fossil fuel industry profits, with companies like Chevron last year producing \u201cmore oil and natural gas than any year in the company\u2019s history.\"\nBetween 2018-19, Microsoft publicized explicit goals\u2014including \u201cexpand production\u201d with Exxon, \u201cgenerate new exploration opportunities\u201d with Chevron, and accelerate \u201cextracted and refined\u201d hydrocarbons with BP. In one Microsoft customer case study, Staale Gjervik, president of ExxonMobil subsidiary XTO Energy, revealed, \u201cOver the coming decade, we plan to drill thousands of new wells and build dozens of new facilities. It\u2019s challenging to keep up with that pace, but with [Microsoft] Azure, we have the digital technology to help support our growth\u2026\u201d\nIn 2020, following Microsoft's major carbon announcements and scrutiny from Greenpeace's \"Oil in the Cloud\" report, the company shifted the tone of its public communications, largely omitting such references from its public-facing materials. However, inside the company, the focus on increasing extraction flourished. Over the past four years, fossil fuel companies became among the top consumers of Microsoft's cloud and AI services\u2014and now, generative AI has supercharged the problem.\nAnalyst reports suggest that advanced technologies\u2014such as AI or machine learning (ML)\u2014have the potential to increase fossil fuel yield by 15%, contributing to a resurgence of oil and potentially delaying the global transition to renewable energy. The real-world impacts are staggering: A single such deal between Microsoft and ExxonMobil could generate emissions that exceed Microsoft\u2019s 2020 annual carbon removal commitments by over 600%. I saw dozens of such deals during the time I was employed at Microsoft.\nInternally, discussions highlighted the most significant application of generative AI for the oil and gas industry: optimizing exploration activities. AI was celebrated as a \"game changer\" and the key for the fossil fuel industry to continue to be competitive.\nMicrosoft makes billions of dollars from helping fossil fuel companies accelerate all phases of oil and gas production. This makes their claims of facilitating the transition to a decarbonized economy and establishing AI guardrails toward a \u201cnature-positive future\u201d seem to me to be misleading for shareholders, employees, and customers who trust and invest in Microsoft due to its strong sustainability reputation. While Microsoft\u2019s public statements and reports highlight the beneficial applications of AI for sustainability, they crucially omit the fact that a substantial part of Microsoft\u2019s business is providing technology to fossil fuel companies to increase production.\nEven if AI reduces emissions per barrel, its role in boosting overall production leads to a net increase in global emissions. Enhanced efficiency translates into more drilling, which undermines the transition to renewables, as the additional fossil fuels brought to market far outweigh any modest extraction-related emission cuts.\nMicrosoft\u2019s dual approach\u2014promoting sustainability publicly while aiding fossil fuel expansion privately\u2014creates a misleading narrative that can obscure the true environmental impact of their business practices.\nTo be clear: While we were at Microsoft, my colleagues and I never advocated for the company to sever its ties with the fossil fuel industry; we understood we were still operating in a world dependent on oil. But we did argue that Microsoft needed to align its AI policies with broader global climate aims. The company needed to work to change the system, not capitulate to it.\nMicrosoft, and other AI companies, can do this by ensuring they are aligning their work in a way that supports climate policies. They can conduct audits of their impact, disclose the climate risks the application of their technologies pose, and actively shift revenue to renewable energy. Most importantly, doing these things and being transparent about the progress they are making\u2014and the challenges they are facing\u2014will encourage competitors to follow.\nRelying on fossil-fuel companies to lead the clean-energy transition is risky, as their interests fundamentally remain tied to high-carbon activities. We can leverage their expertise without supporting their entire business, while public investment and green innovators drive the real shift to sustainable infrastructure.\nMicrosoft's influence can reshape market dynamics and set an industry precedent, akin to its decisions on facial recognition and Google\u2019s moratorium on custom AI for the oil and gas sector. As stated by Microsoft, \u201cIf the world is going to meet net zero goals by 2050, companies need to use their entire ecosystem and all of their positions of influence.\u201d But this will only happen if they are transparent with the public about the progress they are making.\nWe presented these carefully considered recommendations to top Microsoft leadership, who enthusiastically agreed with us, but failed to follow through with implementation.\nMicrosoft has the capacity to do better than unfulfilled promises to employees and energy principles\u2014their response to our internal pressure\u2014that fail to address the core issues. Microsoft, and the tech industry at large, must take responsibility for the emissions enabled by their technology and lead the way toward a truly sustainable future for all.\n(Microsoft had no comment when contacted by Fortune.)\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of\u00a0Fortune.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft: Cloud and AI Will Bring the Stock to New Highs",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Microsoft has regularly outpaced the stock market, more than tripling over the past five years. The stock is\u00a0a little\u00a0less than 10% removed from its all-time high, but it won\u2019t be like that for long. Microsoft Cloud and the company\u2019s AI initiatives prompt me to be bullish on the stock. These two parts of Microsoft\u2019s business can help the stock reach a new high.\nTo begin with, Microsoft isn\u2019t the only cloud giant in town, but it\u2019s gaining ground on the largest cloud provider, warranting a bullish stance. Microsoft now has a 25% market share in the cloud computing industry. It\u2019s an improvement that narrows the gap with Amazon (AMZN). AWS is currently the largest cloud platform and has 31% of the market. Alphabet (GOOGL) is in a distant third place, with 11% of the total market share.\nMoreover, Microsoft gained even more ground in the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. Cloud revenue grew by 21% year-over-year in Q4 FY24, while AWS revenue only increased by 19% year-over-year in Q2 2024. If Microsoft maintains an elevated growth rate compared to AWS, it can continue to gain market share.\nIn addition, more market share is good in any industry, but it\u2019s even better in a growing industry. Artificial intelligence should result in more demand for cloud platforms. These platforms offer a pathway for many businesses to use generative AI. Microsoft also regularly updates its cloud platform with new AI features that help it stand out from the competition.\nThe unique angle with Microsoft compared to other tech giants in the cloud industry is that most of Microsoft\u2019s revenue comes from cloud computing. That\u2019s another reason for my bullishness since cloud computing is a promising industry.\nWhat\u2019s important to note\u00a0is that cloud revenue makes up less than 20% of total revenue for Amazon (as seen below in the TipRanks Revenue Breakdown tool) and Alphabet. Investors in those stocks are getting limited exposure to cloud computing since the other components of those companies generate most of the revenue.\nOn the other hand, Microsoft regularly pulls in more than half of its revenue from cloud computing \u2013 as seen in the TipRanks Revenue Breakdown tool below. The tech giant generated $64.7 billion in Q4 FY24, which was up by 15% year-over-year. Diving deeper into the numbers, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in the quarter, up by 21% year-over-year. That\u2019s almost 60% of total revenue.\nMicrosoft Cloud gave the company a head start in artificial intelligence, but the cloud platform isn\u2019t the only AI catalyst. Microsoft\u2019s investments in OpenAI and the release of Copilot are\u00a0some of the\u00a0reasons I\u2019m bullish. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the Q4 FY24 results to emphasize Microsoft\u2019s desire to ensure it is leading the AI era.\nAdditionally, while tech giants have been catching up, Microsoft has done a good job at incorporating AI across its offerings. For instance, you can find autogenerated suggestions underneath LinkedIn posts. Microsoft Copilot also helps boost productivity by simplifying repetitive tasks across Microsoft products. The tech giant also revealed Copilot for Security earlier this year, which makes cybersecurity more accessible to small businesses.\nAlthough\u00a0Microsoft was always bound to cede some of its market share to rivals, the tech giant\u2019s first-mover advantage suggests that it can maintain its current position. As the AI pie continues to grow, Microsoft should report elevated revenue and net income growth.\nWhile AI and cloud computing are the main reasons to be bullish about Microsoft, it also has other business segments that continue to perform well. For instance, LinkedIn delivered 10% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 FY24. The social network has become a top resource for business professionals who want to grow their careers and build their networks.\nFurthermore, Microsoft delivered 19% year-over-year revenue growth for search and news advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs. Microsoft also fortified its position in the gaming industry with its Activision Blizzard acquisition. As a result, Xbox revenue jumped by 61% year-over-year, with Activision Blizzard contributing 58 percentage points to the growth rate.\nOverall, Microsoft\u2019s well-diversified business is hard to find among other publicly traded corporations. In addition, the company\u2019s investments in artificial intelligence can help the company discover more growth opportunities with these parts of the business.\nMicrosoft is currently rated as a Strong Buy by 30 analysts, with 28 Buys and 2 Holds. The average MSFT price target of $501.15 implies an upside potential of 16%.\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\nMicrosoft is the only Magnificent Seven stock that generates more than half of its total revenue from cloud computing. That unique setup has translated into solid long-term gains, and it\u2019s also positioning Microsoft to reach new highs. The company\u2019s AI investments have given it a respectable lead over competitors and have strengthened Microsoft\u2019s product line. The tech giant is well-diversified and presents a promising opportunity for patient investors.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.\u00a0 Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings.

It has invested more than $10 billion in OpenAI, the California-based AI startup that launched ChatGPT back in late 2022. Latest reports suggest that Sam Altman, the CEO of the startup, has been lobbying the US government over a plan to build the AI infrastructure needed for supporting AI-based machines and systems across the world. This plan includes tens of billions in spending to set up data centers, grow energy capacity and transmission with renewables, and expand semiconductor manufacturing.\nAltman is forming a coalition of global investors for the purpose, with backers in Canada, Korea, Japan, and United Arab Emirates. There are also rumors that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be an active participant in the coalition. The reports come as OpenAI nears a new funding round that could push the valuation of the startup to over $100 billion. Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple are rumored to participate.\nOverall MSFT ranks 6th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Other clients include Honeywell International Inc. and financial services firm Finastra Group Holdings Ltd. Microsoft said Copilot customers increased by more than 60% in the most recent quarter, compared with the previous period, while the number of clients with more than 10,000 users doubled. The company didn\u2019t disclose overall customer totals.\nMicrosoft has been infusing its product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI and is touting the new features as a second wave of business-oriented Copilots, AI tools designed to turbocharge programs like Teams conferencing software, Word and Outlook, among other applications.\nConnecting popular Office software to AI models from OpenAI helps differentiate Microsoft\u2019s products from rival offerings, including OpenAI\u2019s own. OpenAI last week released a new model, called o1, that can perform some human-like reasoning tasks, and Microsoft said Monday that it would integrate the technology in its own products at some point.\nMicrosoft has cited strong demand for the earlier versions of the products, and customers praise some of their capabilities, especially the ability to summarize meetings and documents. The Copilots cost $30 a month per user and could one day become a major new revenue stream.\nBut many features remain a work in progress \u2014 generating new content has been more unreliable and the same is true of using the AI tools for things like spreadsheets or tasks that require understanding context. In recent months, skittish investors have signaled impatience with tech companies\u2019 efforts to profit from their massive investments in AI.\nMicrosoft is also rolling out a new feature for Copilot\u2019s chat application called Pages, which gives coworkers a space to work together using data they create and as well as content generated by the AI software. Pages saves the AI-generated material in one place and lets workers edit and share it with other employees. The new feature is being released Monday and will be widely available later this month. \u201cYou can ideate with AI and collaborate with other people,\u201d said Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella.\nMicrosoft is also widely releasing its Copilot tools for the Excel spreadsheet app, which will help users create charts and pivot tables. The Excel Copilot can also work with text data and use the Python programming language for things like forecasts and risk analysis. The Python features, in preview now, are accessible using regular language instead of programming code.\nThe software giant announced new AI features for Word, Teams and PowerPoint. A new Prioritize My Inbox option in Outlook analyzes a user\u2019s messages based on what emails they respond to and who they report to in the office in order to help declutter. The program, which will be available to preview late this year, also summarizes the messages and explains why they\u2019ve been prioritized.\n(Updated with timing of new Pages feature.

A copy of the letter can be\u00a0downloaded here. In 2024\u2019s second quarter, U.S. stocks were positive, with the S&P 500 rising 4.28%. The Materials and Industrials sectors underperformed compared to the S&P 500 Index, while the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors outperformed. There was a notable return gap in the second quarter, where large-cap growth stocks saw meaningful gains, while smaller-cap and particularly value stocks lagged. Against this backdrop, the fund outperformed the Russell 3000 Growth Index in the quarter. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\nAlger Spectra Fund highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions.\u00a0The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 2.76%, and its shares gained 23.00% of their value over the last 52 weeks.

The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure's growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams.

        "Text": "One of the magnificent 7 stocks, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, is part of the $3 trillion club as its shares have seen an impressive run over the past few years. However, after hitting a record high on July 5, the MSFT stock has underperformed the S&P 500 this year (+15.9% vs. +18.1%).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBut will Microsoft\u2019s recent share repurchase program boost its stock price and provide an ideal entry point for potential buyers? Let\u2019s see \u2013\n\u00a0\nMicrosoft recently approved a stock-buyback program, a shareholder-friendly initiative. Microsoft\u2019s new $60 billion share repurchase program is the third largest this year after stock buyback authorizations of $100 billion and $70 billion by Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, respectively.\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Meta Platforms, Inc. META had earlier approved $50 billion share repurchase programs. However, Microsoft\u2019s new stock repurchase program matched its largest-ever buyback program (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\n\u00a0\nMicrosoft\u2019s share repurchases indicate that the company\u2019s board of directors is hopeful about its future business scenarios.\nThe repurchase program is aimed at Microsoft acquiring its outstanding shares and reducing the numbers available in the open market. This, in turn, would increase the value of the remaining shares, a boon for Microsoft\u2019s shareholders.\nMicrosoft is opting for a buyback to boost earnings per share (EPS) vis-\u00e0-vis the stock price. Microsoft stock, currently, is trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA), indicating a long-term uptrend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nMicrosoft\u2019s coveted Azure and cloud services business has generated a revenue growth of 29% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. Azure\u2019s growth strengthened Microsoft\u2019s position in the highly competitive cloud-computing market, mostly dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nMicrosoft has already spent $55.7 billion in fiscal 2024 on its cloud business and plans to increase its capital expenditures as Azure has picked up steam. The Azure cloud infrastructure unit is growing faster than AWS and if the trend persists, Azure could be the industry leader soon. In 2019, Azure was half the size of AWS, but now it\u2019s three-quarters! As a result, the $13.04 Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT\u2019s EPS is up 5% yearly.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft is generating profits competently and has used the capital optimally invested by shareholders. After all, Microsoft\u2019s return on equity (ROE) is 36%, almost neck and neck with the Computer - Software industry\u2019s 36.1%. Any reading above 20% is likely considered to be very strong.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft has a strong cash balance of $75.54 billion (as of June 30, 2024), which would help it pay off its dues and boost shareholders\u2019 wealth through dividends. Microsoft recently announced a quarterly dividend of 83 cents a share to be paid on Dec. 12, 2024, up 10% from the previous quarter\u2019s payout. Microsoft\u2019s dividend payout has increased by almost 10.3% in the past five years, indicating a sound business model.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nIntroducing a share repurchase plan, the possibility of Azure taking the lead from AWS, and generating a guaranteed income through dividends should allure anyone to buy MSFT shares.\nHowever, the MSFT stock is expensive. Its price/earnings ratio is 33.3X forward earnings, while the broader S&P 500\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 23.8X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHence, it\u2019s prudent for astute investors to wait for the opportune moment to buy MSFT stock and not burn a hole in one\u2019s pocket. For those invested in MSFT stock, hold on to it, since Microsoft is a blue-chip company having a long track record of profitability. Currently, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Title": "How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation",
        "Author": "  keniofontes ",
        "Text": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is still the second most valuable company on the planet, narrowly beaten by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\nAmong the 10 largest companies in the United States, some stand out for being traded at above-market multiples, such as the two already mentioned, but also Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\nOf all these, some require very aggressive projections or accept a low margin of safety to justify the valuation, such as Tesla, where it is necessary to consider substantial increases in fundamentals through the FSD, or Apple where the high price-to-earnings does not go well with growth prospects, but this is not really the case with Microsoft.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nEven though it is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio very similar to Apple's, Microsoft is expected to grow faster and has very solid competitive advantages that guarantee good sustainability, and it is also possible to benefit from various opportunities since its revenue is very diversified.\nMicrosoft divides its revenue sources into three main ones: Productivity and Business Processes, which is the portion that encompasses Office Commercial, Office Consumer, LinkedIn, and Dynamics business solutions, represented 31% of revenue in FYQ4; Intelligent Cloud, which encompasses server products and cloud services such as Azure, Visual Studio, GitHub and others, represented 44% of revenue in the last quarter; and finally, More Personal Computing, which corresponds to revenue generated by Windows, Gaming (Xbox and the like), search and news, represented 25% of revenue in the last quarter.\nNote that even if we divide the revenues into three, there are an infinite number of sub-segments within each one, and although they have divergent perspectives, the vast majority are good businesses that manage to make significant progress in terms of revenue and still do so steadily, supported by the competitive advantages of each one.\nWindows, for example, is present on more than 70% of desktops, and with this data alone, it would be possible to compile a list of competitive advantages, such as gains in scale, cross-selling power, lock-in effect, better compatibility, and so on. Not to mention Office 365 and its applications, which are used by thousands of huge companies that need to use Microsoft products on a daily basis, not only on Windows, but also on Macs and cell phones, and although there are alternatives that could threaten this market share - such as the tools from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) - the level of loyalty is very high.\nThese characteristics reflect directly on Microsoft's fundamentals, with the power to improve its recurring revenue, pass on inflation to the price of its services, grow on other fronts, the company has been able to grow its revenue per share by an average of 12.2% and its EPS growth by 20.9% over the last 20 years, while in the same period, EPS growth was 20.9%, also showing the improvement in net income margin.\nSource: GuruFocus\nWith these moats and stability, it is already possible to infer that Microsoft deserves a multiple at least in relation to the average of its market, for differing in quality.\nIn the most recent quarter (Fiscal Q4), this positive trend continued, with Microsoft growing all three of these main revenue lines by double digits, resulting in a consolidated growth of 15%. Drilling down a little further, the highlights were server products and cloud services, which increased by 21%, and Xbox content and services, which increased by 61% but were impacted by the Activision acquisition, while Office Consumer products only increased by 3%.\nSource: Microsoft's presentation\nFor the next few years, these good figures will continue (depending on the year and the analyst, it could even be more optimistic in fact). According to the forecast, the average revenue growth for the next 3 fiscal years is ~14.3% and for EPS this is even better, with growth of just over 15% and reaching $17.98 EPS in fiscal year 2026.\nConstructing a scenario where Microsoft maintains growth close to 15% is quite reasonable. I'd even say easy. Its more traditional part, Productivity and Business Processes, has the capacity to maintain price adjustments, continue acquiring new customers, and also benefit from secular trends in productivity, cybersecurity, and AI, since the trend is for Office 365 to become increasingly complete and integrated.\nMore personal computing should be driven by trends such as the new Copilot PCs that can help increase sales, improve the operating system update cycle, and the like. Copilot subscriptions alone could also show significant growth over the next few years, especially with a view to more widespread adoption.\nThe cloud division, which is already the largest part of revenue, also has secular trends and is still one of the pillars for the advance of Artificial Intelligence. In the last earnings call, it was mentioned that the Azure AI customer base reached 60,000 customers, growing 60% YoY.\nSome more macro trends, such as the acquisition of customers in emerging markets and small and medium-sized businesses that don't yet have access to these products and services, could also continue to drive the growth of Microsoft's financials.\nWhat bothers me is that while it's easy to understand scenarios where the company grows close to 15% over the next few years, it's difficult to perpetuate this for a few decades. It is possible for a company that already has revenues of close to $250bn and a net income of almost $90bn to continue growing at an accelerated rate, but this may become increasingly difficult. New ventures, for example, will need to mature more and more if they are to make any difference to annual growth, and at some point, it may become more difficult to acquire new customers around the world.\nConsidering the growth mentioned in the previous section, in a few years this premium would already become something closer to the index average, taking the average of the 2026 EPS estimates, the price-to-earnings would be just over 24x, a value that seems quite reasonable considering that we are talking about one of the most consolidated companies in the world and one that still has a lot to grow. Doing the same with Apple, the price-to-earnings for fiscal year 2026 would be ~27.2x, a higher level even if it is driven by large buybacks.\nHistorically, Microsoft has traded at a higher multiple than Apple, but in recent years this gap has been narrowing. In the latest data, Microsoft stocks were trading at 31.8x earnings, while Apple was trading at 30.5x, and although both are excellent companies with good prospects and competitive advantages, Microsoft's growth is a little more reliable (and will probably be higher at least in the short and medium term). It's also worth noting that Apple is trading at a higher premium compared to its own history since the mean of its indicator is ~21.3x while Microsoft's is 26.8x.\nSource: GuruFocus\nAs the scenario for Microsoft's growth is clearer and the company continues to be one of the main players that will benefit from the AI trend, this premium in relation to both the market and its own history seems reasonable to me. Another factor that supports the bullish thesis is that there may be positive surprises along the way, especially considering the company's good track record of management, capital allocation, and the like.\nThis valuation level is even better justified considering the quality. Microsoft is a unique company and ends up being barely comparable with the market average and even with the US Treasury. Many investors may prefer to expose themselves to the 10-year treasury which is paying ~3.7% than to buy Microsoft which has an earnings/market cap ratio of ~2.7%, but it is necessary to consider that by fiscal year 2026, this earnings yield should exceed 4%.\nTraditionally, a DCF should consider a more robust equity risk premium, so for Microsoft's current price to work in a DCF model, it is necessary to either consider that it will be able to maintain growth of ~15% for two decades, or discount this cash flow at a very small rate (like 5% or 6%).\nIn short, there isn't a huge asymmetry or bargain here, but you can still justify Microsoft's price without too much trouble.\nIn view of the information above, although Microsoft is far from undervalued, its valuation can be well justified without overly optimistic assumptions or giving up the entire margin of safety. Of course, here the investor is trading upside for quality and stability but still exposing himself to a growth company that could surprise positively in various segments over the next decade, which could then become an interesting option for adding predictability to the portfolio.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other safe stocks to invest in.\nA probable rate cut has provided hope for the economy. Despite that, the impact on financial markets and stocks remains uncertain. On September 4, Adam Parker, Trivariate Research founder and CEO, appeared in an\u00a0interview\u00a0on\u00a0CNBC.\u00a0Parker was not surprised that tech stocks were down by close to 4% at the beginning of September, that too right before an impending rate cut. Parker highlights that the inconsistency in the market at the moment is not normal, and with multiple rate cuts over the next two years, he has no reason to hold a positive economic outlook. He suggests that eight probable rate cuts indicate that the economy is slowing, consumer spending is declining, and unemployment is rising, all of which are not good signs for the market. The interviewer counter questions that eight rate cuts with a 25 basis point reduction are not as disastrous to presume a faltering economy. Parker then highlights that rate cuts in the past have been supported by consistent data, an incremental fiscal, and an expansion of the balance sheet, all of which are currently out of the picture. You can also read our piece on the\u00a0best battery stocks to buy according to short sellers.\nOn September 2, CNBC published a detailed report on the impact of rate cuts on the stock market in the United States. The Fed, in the footsteps of countries in Europe and Asia, recently announced an easing cycle, after a long period of high interest rates. As per current pricing data, the Fed is expected to have three 25-basis point cuts by the end of this year. Speaking of the global economic outlook, 2025 will see a lower-rate environment followed by easing inflationary pressures. However, the fear of recession in the United States tells another story. Analysts believe that the last four months of 2024 will be considerably weak and choppy amid geopolitical factors, uncertainty from the AI sector, corporate earnings, and most importantly, an overdue consolidation correction.\nOn September 3, JP Morgan reported that investors must not expect the cutting cycle to provide a fresh start to stocks. Leading strategists at the firm suggested that the rate cut cycle is rather reactive and is in response to a wilting economy, having little to no impact on stocks.

During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21% year-over-year, and posted record bookings. Its productivity/business processes and intelligent cloud segment, on the other hand, logged revenue worth $20.3 billion and $28.5 billion in revenue, respectively.\nThe company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. Its AI-backed cloud service, Azure OpenAI service witnessed an increase in customer base by 60%, reaching 60,000 clients in the second quarter of 2024. Previously in July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies signed a partnership to enhance and modernize Lumen\u2019s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy Palantir\u2019s suite of products in Microsoft Azure.\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) financial strength coupled with its strategic partnerships make it one of the safest stocks to invest in.\u00a0In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion.

Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI.

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year. But what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features. While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month.

Microsoft has also given such longtime executives as Azure Chief Technology Officer Mark Russinovich and cybersecurity Vice President John Lambert new deputy CISO duties, part of a group of 13 executives with that title.\nThe software maker said it now has the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers working on security.\nThe moves are part of the company\u2019s effort to assure customers, including the US government, that it\u2019s making progress on its Secure Future Initiative, the biggest overhaul to its cybersecurity posture in more than two decades after a series of damaging hacks and a government report that described the company\u2019s security culture as in need of urgent reforms.\nMicrosoft unveiled the initiative in November and named a new chief information security officer in December. In May, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella ordered the company\u2019s engineers to prioritize security above all else, including new product development. The company is also now grappling with how to adjust the way security partners release products that involve its Windows software after a flawed update from CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. triggered a global IT meltdown.\nThe key challenge for Microsoft is finding a balance between cybersecurity and competitive pressure to release updates quickly and create new technologies, especially in artificial intelligence. \u201cCustomers are yelling at you every day that they want a new feature,\u201d said Microsoft security chief Charlie Bell in an interview. \u201cBut they\u2019re not yelling at you every day about the threat of a bad actor.\u201d\nThe conflict between the two imperatives became plain in May, when the AI team unveiled a Windows feature that creates a record of everything users do on their PCs. Named Recall, the product alarmed security experts and had to be pulled back to make adjustments.\n\u201cWhat we learned from Recall was that we still have the work to do,\u201d said Ann Johnson, a longtime security industry executive who moved from Microsoft\u2019s business development group to one of the new deputy CISO roles earlier this year. The answer, she said, is to provide clear guidance to teams \u2014 standardized tools and checklists \u2014 to ensure that all new features and code meet company security standards. \u201cThen they can put out anything, and we\u2019re not in their way,\u201d Johnson said.\nOther deputy CISO\u2019s include Vanessa Feliberti Bautista, a three-decade Microsoft veteran, who will keep tabs on security in Microsoft\u2019s 365 corporate products, and Geoff Belknap, former CISO at LinkedIn and Slack, who will look after Microsoft\u2019s core infrastructure as well as acquisitions.\nIn another sign of Microsoft\u2019s renewed seriousness about product safety, Nadella now devotes an hour during regular Friday leadership meetings to assessing and troubleshooting the security initiative, Bell said. Nadella specifically asked that updates focus on pain points that still need to be addressed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to embrace the red,\u201d Bell said Nadella told the executives. \u201cI don\u2019t want a show telling me how great everything is.\u201d\nNadella also asked his team to stop dwelling on whether complaints about Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity issues were fair and focus on fixes.\n\u201cJust do the work,\u201d Bell said Nadella told Microsoft\u2019s leaders.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Activision and Blizzard\u2019s Corporate Warcraft\nThe End of the Cheap Burger\nThis Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other blue chip stocks.\nWhile economic data may be scarce, every data point gives a new angle to the ever-uncertain economic conditions in the US. On September 12, Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Asset Allocation, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market moves after the consumer price index (CPI) report was released on Wednesday.\nDraho suggested how regular intra-day moves did not hold enough weight to impact or influence the Fed\u2019s decision. However, he did acknowledge that the inflation data and Wall Street\u2019s reaction to it make the case for a 25-basis cut, or more, in the upcoming Fed meeting.\nDraho then hinted that investors are hoping for a soft landing and are looking for stronger reasons or economic cues to hold back, given that bad economic news, as of now, has not triggered investors as much. He also emphasized the need for more financial data and clarity on whether the Fed would be proactive with its rate cuts for further analysis.\nContrary to what investors wish, he believes the Fed will be rather hawkish than proactive with its rate-cutting cycle. He adds that while the market calls for 100 basis points in rate cuts by the end of this year, he does expect the Fed to signal way less.\nHe then shed light on supply challenges in the technology sector, hinting that demand is not the issue at the moment. He was particularly impressed by the earnings posted by AI companies. Draho expects tech companies to have strong balance sheets and strong earnings power by the end of 2024, making them attractive stocks despite the economic turmoil.\nOn September 13, Andrew Krei, Crescent Grove Advisors co-chief investment officer, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his bullish outlook on the economy and financial markets. Krei discussed the labor market trends and how they may impact the Fed\u2019s decisions in the upcoming meeting.\nKrei pressed that despite the \u201cunwarranted\u201d volatility over the past few weeks, the economic outlook remains favorable, with credit markets showing close to no signs of stress. Krei also shed light on the global economic backdrop, suggesting that international markets, especially Europe, Japan, and China were showing strong signs of recovery in trade and manufacturing.\nAs far as investment goes, Krei suggests that while mega-cap tech stocks have shown promising results, he is more bullish on stocks outside of the magnificent 7. He was particularly inclined to companies in healthcare, finance, and industrials, hinting that these sectors will benefit immensely from the easing cycle. He then suggested that investors must shift their focus to diversified stocks with lower valuations and relatively stronger risk-adjusted returns.\nWhatever the state of the economy, some stocks are notorious for their strong and consistent financial results.\ndrserg / Shutterstock.com\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 12 best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers, we first went over multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of blue chip stocks.

And if your forward revenue estimate is going lower not higher but your CapEx is going up, at some point those two things are going to collide.\u201d\nNiles said that major tech companies went through a \u201cdigestion\u201d period after seeing huge returns during the COVID-19 pandemic days, and he expects the same to happen as we move into the next year.\nThe analyst said that on an equal-weighted basis, the broader market is up when compared with Mag. 7 stocks. He recommended investors to buy the stocks that would benefit from rate cuts. These include consumer staples, utilities, telecom services, etc.\nNiles said the other 493 companies could drive the market to new \u201call-time record highs.\u201d\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI trending stocks that are moving after latest analyst ratings and earnings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\ntanuha2001 / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nDan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said while talking about Mag. 7 stocks that Microsoft should \u201cworry\u201d investors.\n\u201cDespite their relationship with OpenAI, they missed their Azure numbers.\u201d\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company\u2019s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and will bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses, both large and small, navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all scales. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of innovative, AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low-double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks Amid Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. said it is cutting 650 jobs in its Xbox unit, the third such layoffs this year as the company tries to rein in costs and integrate its massive $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nPipeline Fire Near Houston Forces Some Residents to Evacuate\nHousing\u2019s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race\nUS Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever\nAn Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life\nAn Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results\nThe roles to be eliminated are in \u201cmostly corporate and supporting functions,\u201d according to a memo sent to staff by Xbox chief Phil Spencer on Thursday. \u201cNo games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.\u201d\nXbox employees had been bracing for further reductions after Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs, many from Activision units and studios, in January. In May, the company announced the shuttering of four studios acquired as part of its $7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax \u2014 one of which was ultimately sold instead. These steps, along with the decision to release some Xbox games on rival consoles, have angered some of the platform\u2019s fans and left them questioning Microsoft\u2019s commitment to building compelling exclusive content.\nIt has been a brutal year for the games industry more broadly, as it reckons with rising game development costs and tepid growth. Sony Group Corp., Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. and Electronic Arts Inc. are among the major global companies that have cut jobs and shut down marquee projects. Sony this month axed big-budget multiplayer shooter Concord only two weeks after its release, showing little patience for a game that got off to a slow start.\nMicrosoft completed the Activision acquisition in October, 21 months after it was announced and following a bruising battle to obtain antitrust clearance. The purchase has given Xbox an infusion of new content and talent, but also a challenge in making the deal pay off over the long run.\nChanges to Microsoft Gaming\nFor the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming\u2014mostly corporate and supporting functions\u2014to organize our business for long term success.\nI know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the US, we\u2019re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the US packages will differ according to location.\nWith these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.\nThroughout our team\u2019s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.\nPhil\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nTo Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In\nIsraeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation\nCollege Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid\nHow an Unknown Chinese Phonemaker Took Over Africa\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

The firm believes competition has \"largely caught up with Microsoft on the AI front,\" which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation.\nBernstein downgraded General Motors (GM) to Market Perform from Outperform with a $53 price target. The shares have appreciated 85% since last November, but Bernstein's data now signals rising earnings headwinds.\nTD Cowen downgraded Ulta Beauty (ULTA) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $395.

        "Text": "Microsoft has entered the world of AI-powered agents with an update to its Microsoft 365 Copilot product that gives users the ability to quickly create a variety of AI assistants that can carry out tasks across both Microsoft\u2019s own software and that of third-party vendors.\nThe software giant has become the second major business software vendor to take the plunge into agents after Salesforce earlier this month announced the rollout of a series of autonomous digital assistants. The Salesforce AI agents can autonomously handle tasks for businesses such as answering customer queries, nurturing sales leads, and analyzing sales and marketing data.\nMany technologists, including Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates, believe the battle for AI agents represents a major shift in how people interact with computers and the internet. Gates has said whoever wins the battle for releasing the most capable AI agents may quickly eclipse other companies, since the AI agents could obviate the need for users to directly interact with sites such Amazon or Google, and may reduce the need for people to use many kinds of business productivity software, from word processors and spreadsheets to enterprise resource planning tools.\nGoogle is known to be working on AI agents of its own, while Apple and Amazon have been trying to update their existing digital assistants, Siri and Alexa, with newer generative AI engines to give them the power to perform many more tasks than they can currently.\nThe Microsoft AI agents are part of a larger of update to Microsoft 365 Copilot that also includes added AI features in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and One Drive.\nThe update also includes a new document type for BizChat\u2014a feature Microsoft introduced in March 2023 where different kinds of customer data types can live, allowing Copilot to draw on them when generating responses. The new document is called Pages and it is a kind of collaborative work surface for both human coworkers and AI digital assistants to share. Microsoft is calling it \u201cthe first real digital artIfact for the AI era.\u201d But it is essentially a kind of digital corkboard onto which other kinds of files can be posted, allowing both humans and AI agents to work simultaneously across them, and making the transfer of data between the files more seamless than with Microsoft\u2019s existing SharePoint and Teams products.\nMicrosoft first rolled out Copilot, as it has branded its generative AI offering in its 365 business productivity suite, in November 2023. While the product has seen widespread adoption by large companies, some chief information officers have complained that their employees have not found use cases for the AI features that justify the $30 per user per month price Microsoft charges. A few companies have even decided to ditch Copilot or have restricted how widely it is available within their organization.\nJared Spataro, Microsoft corporate vice president for AI@Work, told Fortune that Microsoft has taken on board such feedback, engaging with more than 1,000 customers and rolling out more than 700 updates to its Copilot product since it launched.\nHe said that the most popular Copilot feature has been the ability of the AI software to automatically summarize Teams meetings. He said Microsoft realized it needed to find AI features that would produce a similar \u201cspark\u201d with customers across the other 365 apps\u2014\u201cthat thing that, now you\u2019ve seen this and worked with it, you don\u2019t want to work without it,\u201d he said. Spataro said Microsoft believed it had now found such \u201csparks\u201d for Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook and was rolling those out in this latest Copilot update.\nThe main feature enhancement for Excel is the ability for generative AI to automatically compose code in Python directly in Excel and use that to automatically run sophisticated data analysis tasks, including forecasting and data visualization, for users.\nIn PowerPoint, Microsoft is launching a feature called \u201cNarrative Builder\u201d that will let users have a back-and-forth conversation with a generative AI design tool and iteratively edit and improve the PowerPoint deck. While the previous version of 365 Copilot included a generative AI feature that could build a deck from a prompt, users found it did not offer the ability to then easily continue to refine the deck through a dialogue with the AI chatbot.\nFor Outlook, Microsoft is unveiling an AI feature called \u201cPrioritize My Inbox\u201d that Microsoft says will provide personalized, and sophisticated, prioritization of emails.\nThe new genAI features for the 365 apps will be included in the current price of Copilot. But Spataro said Microsoft was still working out how the AI agent capabilities will be priced.\nMicrosoft also reiterated that even users of its free Copilot chatbot enjoyed data privacy protections, meaning that documents or conversations with the chatbot are not used for training future AI systems and even queries that Copilot sends to Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine are anonymized so they can\u2019t be linked back to the user.\nJamie Teevan, Microsoft\u2019s chief scientist, said she was excited to research how people could best work with new generative AI tools, particularly agents. She said Microsoft was investigating three essential aspects of working with AI agents. The first is intent expression, which has to do with how users can be sure to convey their intentions to the agent so that the agent correctly completes specific tasks without doing things the user doesn\u2019t want the agent to do.\nShe said Microsoft was still working to figure out things such as when and how the agent should ask the user clarifying questions to better understand their intent and how and when the agent should interrupt users to offer suggestions. Microsoft is keen to avoid repeating the experience many users had with Clippy, a much-derided early AI assistant it rolled out in Microsoft Word (\u201cI see you are writing a business letter!\u201d) whose interjections users often found intrusive and unhelpful.\nThe other two areas Microsoft researchers are keen to figure out as it rolls out agents is around persistence (what should the agent remember about the user or the project, and how much of this should it retain even across projects) and collaboration.\nTeevan said that Microsoft has realized that many Copilot users may not be seeing the full value of the product because they don\u2019t know the best ways to use it, so the company has begun rolling out more of what it calls \u201cprompt support\u201d\u2014which are basically suggested prompts and suggestions for using Copilot to derive business value.\nUpdate, Sept. 16: This story has been updated to clarify the relationship between BizChat and Pages.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. shares have lost their luster in the past few months, with some investors cooling on the artificial-intelligence trade and looking for better value elsewhere in the sector.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nA Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nShares in the software company dipped lower by less than 1% over the past six months, compared with an almost 10% gain for the Nasdaq 100 Index. With a drop of 0.6% on Tuesday, the stock is nearly 9% below its all-time high, while an exchange-traded fund that tracks software firms closed at a record on Monday. The underperformance has come as Microsoft reported mixed results in its latest quarter and as AI more generally loses steam as a driver of stock gains.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some AI fatigue when it comes to companies like Microsoft, given the incredible run they\u2019ve had,\u201d said Neville Javeri, senior fund manager at Allspring Global Investments. Investors \u201cneed to see additional proof points about demand for AI products and services for the rally to hold.\u201d\nAnalysts at D.A. Davidson have also turned more cautious on Microsoft.\n\u201cCompetition has largely caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation,\u201d analyst Gil Luria wrote in a note last week, citing cloud rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. A diminished lead in AI \u201cwill make it hard for MSFT to continue to outperform,\u201d Luria said, downgrading the stock to neutral from buy.\nMicrosoft trades at 31 times estimated earnings and almost 11 times projected revenue. While both multiples are down from recent peaks, they\u2019re well above their 10-year averages. The Nasdaq 100 trades at less than 26 times forward earnings and under 5 times sales.\nThe stock has also gathered some unfavorable comparisons to Oracle Corp., which has emerged as a popular alternative for software investors after its latest results showed robust AI tailwinds of its own. Oracle offers a lower multiple, trading at 26 times projected earnings, prompting several firms to upgrade the stock over the past month.\n\u201cOracle is sort of the new kid on the block, because it is more in the first innings of the growth curve,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cMore investors are rolling up their sleeves to look at it, whereas with Microsoft, they\u2019re sharpening their pencils as they focus on Azure growth and when it will see more of a return on its capex.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s July earnings, in contrast, revealed a slowdown in its Azure cloud-computing service. While it showed growth attributable to AI, that figure was lower than some had hoped, underlining concerns about when Microsoft will see a more pronounced return on investments in AI.\nEven after a weaker couple of months, Microsoft shares remain up 14% this year \u2014 and the recent underperformance follows a 57% gain in 2023. The vast majority on Wall Street remain bullish, with more than 94% of analysts rating Microsoft stock a buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe company\u2019s long-term prospects are also still viewed favorably. Revenue is expected to rise 14.5% in the 2025 fiscal year and accelerate for the next few years, reaching a 19% pace by 2028. Net earnings per share are also seen growing at a double-digit clip for the next several years.\nWith that backdrop, investors like Allspring\u2019s Javeri and Logan Capital\u2019s Ouimet remain positive on the shares in the long-term, despite short-term challenges.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never surprising to see a stock take a pause, especially after doing well and with the market rally broadening, but it\u2019s hard to find a company of this size and quality that\u2019s going to grow at this level for the next several years,\u201d Ouimet said. \u201cMicrosoft is so well positioned that the more it pulls back, the more attractive it looks.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nMeta Platforms Inc. shares just closed out the third quarter with a 13.5% advance, marking their seventh straight quarter of gains. That\u2019s the longest such streak for the Facebook parent since 2016. The stock is up more than 375% over the seven-quarter surge, with recent strength reflecting the company\u2019s potential to benefit from AI.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Reveals 12 Stocks Investors Should Monitor Closely.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current state of the economy, noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play. One economy is struggling with higher interest rates, making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive, while the other seems unaffected by these rates. This division explains why, even after a double rate cut, the stock market, including the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, still experienced declines.\n\"There really are two economies in this country. There's one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it's harder to find a job, and then there's another that says we don't really care about where the rates are. That's how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the Dow dipping 103 points, the S&P declining 29 points, and the Nasdaq shedding 31 points.\"\nJim Cramer highlights that many companies, especially retailers and restaurants serving low-income customers, are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts. While this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors, which initially rose in stock prices before selling off, the tech sector in Silicon Valley remains largely unaffected. Cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates, focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers. Their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations.\n\"There are so many companies I talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they can't make their forecasts because rates are too high. We've been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants, especially those that cater to the less well-off. They needed this double rate cut\u2014believe me. It's great for housing, and it can help the industrials; those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted. That is a very typical action.\nAdditionally, he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes, washing machines, or cars. Unlike housing, which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales, the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the home-buying process. While lower rates can encourage new businesses, many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions.\n\"You see, these tech companies aren't selling homes; they aren't selling washing machines or cars or steel or plastic\u2014things worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store. Housing, of course, needs lower mortgage rates to get sales going. Tech doesn't care about mortgage rates; they just want to create software that reduces some of the friction you encounter in the process of buying a home. Lower rates make it more likely that people start new companies, but most new companies are too small to need major enterprise software. Companies we talk to can see small-cap companies go up, but big enterprise software? Not so much.\"\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve cut rates to help control inflation, which benefits more businesses overall. However, in the tech industry, the focus is on increasing efficiency through automation, often resulting in fewer employees. These tech companies aim to avoid being affected by the Fed's decisions because relying on them would indicate weakness and vulnerability to the economic cycle, which they actively seek to evade.\n\"The Fed wanted to be sure that inflation is contained and going in the right direction, which then allowed them to relent and cut by 50 basis points. Now, more businesses in the East can thrive, but out here, the presumption is that all enterprises are trying to raise margins, often by automating everything that can be automated, which means using fewer people. These tech companies are automators; they never want to be hostage to the Fed. They don't want you to be hostage to the Fed because that would be a sign of weakness\u2014a sign of cyclicality. Oh, they hate cyclicality. Why be hostage to the business cycle if you don't have to?\"\nFinally, Jim Cramer emphasizes that many people see artificial intelligence as a key player in today's market. Companies that leverage AI can improve their profit margins, which boosts earnings even if their overall sales are declining. This means that even without increasing sales, AI can help businesses become more profitable.\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nJim Cramer reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is collaborating with\nBlackRock, Inc.\n(NYSE:BLK) and other companies to raise $100 billion aimed at developing data centers for AI and the necessary energy infrastructure. This initiative called the Global Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP), is initially focused on raising $30 billion to support both new and existing data centers.\n\"Microsoft, meanwhile, is joining BlackRock and other companies to raise $100 billion to develop data centers for AI and the energy infrastructure to power them. The Global Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Investment Partnership, or GAIIP, is initially looking to raise $30 billion for new and existing data centers.\"\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s positive outlook is supported by strong Q2 2024 earnings, with total revenue of $59 billion, a 15% increase from last year, and a net income of $21 billion, indicating healthy profit margins. A key factor in this growth is the cloud services segment, especially Azure, which experienced a 25% revenue increase, reinforcing Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s leadership in the cloud market.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s hybrid cloud strategy and seamless integration of Azure with other Microsoft products give it a competitive edge. Additionally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s significant investments in artificial intelligence, including its partnership with OpenAI and new AI features in Microsoft 365 and Azure, position it well for future growth as demand for AI tools rises.\nThe ongoing popularity of Office 365 among businesses and consumers ensures steady subscription revenue, while the gaming division, boosted by initiatives like Xbox Game Pass and the acquisition of\nActivision Blizzard, Inc.\n(NASDAQ:ATVI), is expected to drive further engagement and revenue. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s commitment to sustainability, with ambitious goals for carbon neutrality and renewable energy, appeals to modern consumers and investors, enhancing its brand reputation.\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Microsoft Announces 10% Dividend Hike and Share Buyback: What It Means for Investors",
        "Author": "  Eric Reed ",
        "Text": "Microsoft ($MSFT) investors are about to be rewarded. On September 16, the company announced that it will increase its dividend payments by 10%, from $0.75 per share to $0.83. This is consistent with the company's past practices, as it has increased dividends regularly for the past 10 years. At the same time, the company announced an upcoming $60 billion share buyback. This will likely generate a modest increase in the company's stock price.\nHere's what this means for Microsoft investors.\u00a0And to stay up to date on news that may impact Microsoft and other potential investments, sign up for the Market Minute newsletter.\nDividends are a form of profit sharing for corporate shareholders. When a company issues dividends, it makes a direct payment to each shareholder on a per-share basis. So, for example, in the case of Microsoft this means that the company will directly pay $0.83 to each shareholder for each share of the company's stock they own. An investor who owns 1,000 shares, then, would receive a check for $830.\nA company is not legally obligated to make or continue dividend payments, although a firm can impose this requirement on itself through a corporate charter or other contract. The amount, timing and continuation of dividend payments are otherwise entirely at the company's discretion. That said, many firms make a regular practice of issuing dividends in order to encourage investment. Payment schedules are at the discretion of the company. Many companies, including Microsoft, issue their dividends on a quarterly basis.\nBuybacks are when a company purchases its own stock. It can do this from the public market at large or through specific deals with institutional investors. By repurchasing its own stock, a company reduces the available share of equity available to third parties. This may allow the company to have more flexibility by mitigating risks including hostile takeovers and investor activism.\nA buyback also gives the company more opportunity to generate capital through investment. By purchasing its own stock, the company now holds more of its own equity that it can later sell to investors, ideally if the company's share price has increased. (Here, it's important to remember that stock sales on the open market are almost always between investors. This secondary market does not directly generate any capital for the underlying company. A firm only generates capital when it sells its own shares directly.)\nConsider speaking with a financial advisor if you need help determining evaluating the role of dividends and stock buybacks in your investment strategy.\nThe new dividend will be distributed quarterly starting on December 12, 2024, to shareholders registered by November 21, 2024. For investors, Microsoft's increased dividend will likely have a couple of impacts.\nFirst, this is likely to increase the price of Microsoft stock modestly. A higher dividend makes the stock more valuable, since it means that shareholders will receive larger payments. That said, this isn't likely to have an outsized effect on the company's stock. Microsoft has issued a roughly 10% increase every year since 2013, so this past practice will already be baked into the share price to some degree.\nSecond, and more directly, this will mean a windfall for current and future shareholders. Anyone who owns Microsoft stock receives quarterly dividend payments. Those payments will now increase by 10%. This significantly outstrips inflation, making their shares more valuable both in terms of on-paper value and spending power. Unfortunately, since dividends are taxed as ordinary income, this will also mean higher income taxes for 2024, since the first $0.83 payments will be issued in November, 2024.\nSign up for the Market Minute newsletter to get economic and financial news that may impact $MSFT and other stocks.\nFor investors, the main impact of a buyback will be a likely, modest increase in share prices.\nWith a stock buyback, a company makes a large purchase of its own stock. In this case, Microsoft plans to purchase up to $60 billion worth of shares, or around 1.8% of its market cap. ($60 billion / $3.2 trillion) This will in theory increase demand for the stock while also reducing the supply of shares on the market, both of which typically have the effect of increasing the stock price.\nThe impact of buyback programs can range. Research has historically found that a buyback will increase a company's share price by between 2% and 12% in the short term.\u00a0For this reason, buybacks were historically illegal, as the SEC considered them a form of market manipulation. This rule was rolled back in the early 1980s, and today S&P 500 companies dedicate roughly half of their profits to buyback programs.\nHowever, this average impact tends to break down into two categories. Historical research has found that value stocks, companies generally undervalued by the market, have an outsized reaction to buyback programs, sometimes posting average price increases up to 45%.\u00a0For well-known companies, where undervaluation is unlikely, price impacts tend to be minor, if significantly noticeable at all.\nWhat's more, the sustained impact on investors is often smaller than it may seem. While stock buybacks are associated with short-term price increases, as noted above those increases can range widely. More importantly, any noticeable price increase from a one-time buyback is usually transitory. As researchers have found, it typically \"dissipates completely over the subsequent month.\"\u00a0In order to see a sustained, significant price increase, a company may need to engage in a sustained program of repeated buybacks over a period of several years.\nThe upshot is that, for individual investors, Microsoft's buyback program may increase the value of their shares. However, based on historic market performance, that price increase is unlikely to be significant and will most likely be transitory unless it is part of an ongoing program of buybacks over the coming 12 to 24 months. That said, the company intends to purchase a very significant portion of its total market value, which may generate a larger-than-usual impact on the market overall. All investments involve risk. Consider speaking about your investment strategy with a financial advisor.\nMicrosoft has announced both increased dividends and a $60 billion share buyback. For investors, this is likely to be a windfall, although the gains will likely come primarily from the dividend payments.\nDividend investing is part of what's called \"income investing.\" This is when you build a portfolio that generates regular payments just for holding the underlying assets, rather than a portfolio that requires selling your assets for capital gains. This can be an extremely effective way of building a sustainable retirement fund, although it's not without risks. Here's how to think about it.\u00a0\nA financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid \u2014 in an account that isn\u2019t at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation.

Key discussions revolved around energy-efficient computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced semiconductor technologies, signaling critical transformations in tech and telecommunications. At the conference, companies working in the tech universe outlined their strategic outlooks, emphasizing the role of energy-efficient computing in driving semiconductor growth, with industries like AI, IoT, robotics, and autonomous vehicles fueling multi-trillion-dollar shifts.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOne of the highlights of the conference was the appearance of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who appeared alongside Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to discuss the AI industry in great detail. Quizzed about the recent US export controls on chips to China and the rise in geopolitical tensions potentially harming supplies, Huang outlined that his company was confident that if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the Taiwan-based leading supplier of advanced AI chips to NVIDIA, was compromised, the chip supply would continue, even though it would not be as good. Huang stressed that NVIDIA possessed enough intellectual property to transfer chip production from one plant to another, if need be.\nNVIDIA has lost more than 15% of market capitalization since it issued third quarter guidance numbers that raised worries about slowing earnings growth. In particular, there were concerns about the concentration of hyperscalers in the NVIDIA business model, with four large customers representing nearly half of the revenue of the firm in relation to the AI boom. Following the appearance of Huang at the conference, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, backing the company to pick up sales in the coming months as demand for accelerated computing continued to be really strong and broadened into enterprise and sovereign states.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through the proceedings of the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference.

The CTO of the company, Kevin Scott, spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, remarking that it was super important for the business world to bring down the cost of compute associated with AI development. Scott underlined how one of the things that had supported all of the previous platform revolutions \u2013 personal computing, internet, smartphone, and cloud \u2013 had been the ability to move from silicon to networks to the low-level software layers that empowered the layers running on top of them to get exponentially cheaper over time. He noted that this was happening with AI, as evidenced by GPT-4 getting 12 times cheaper per token to do inference in May than at launch time.\nScott, who was an intern at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) before rising all the way to the top, noted that AI infrastructure had catalyzed a lot of similarities to big tech revolutions of the past. He detailed that because AI was a platform revolution, it was not narrow, where some company had a secret stash of infrastructure that only they had, but instead there was a huge community of people being inspired in a bunch of different ways by what the AI infrastructure was going to allow them to do. Scott said that trillion-dollar companies that are brand new were getting created due to these developments.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0among the buzzing AI stocks to buy according to Goldman Sachs.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Microsoft vs. Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Chris Neiger, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) race is still in its early stages, though it might not feel like it, and there's still plenty of time for tech companies to overtake each other. For investors looking for opportunities in the space, it may be appealing to pick a small AI start-up that might grow by leaps and bounds, but larger companies have deeper pockets, making their AI investments (and shifting strategies) much more likely to succeed.\nWhich ones will prove to be the best AI stocks in the coming years? Let's take a look at what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are doing to shore up their AI dominance, and consider which one is more likely to be the better artificial intelligence stock in the coming years.\nLet's start with the most obviously smart AI move Microsoft has made: It invested an estimated $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. That gave Microsoft early access to some of the most advanced AI models available, and it wisely started embedding them into nearly all of its software products.\nChatGPT is the underlying AI tech in Microsoft's Copilot tools, which are now in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The software bundle they comprise, Microsoft 365, is used by 1.3 million companies in the U.S. alone. For tens of millions of workers, Microsoft's software is now synonymous with the advanced AI tools they use every day.\nThis integration is already paying off for Microsoft, and the best example may come from the company's GitHub developer platform, in which 40% of its recent revenue growth came from Copilot, according to management. Microsoft's leadership said on the fourth-quarter earnings call that AI is driving GitHub's growth and has boosted its annual revenue run rate to $2 billion.\nOf course, Microsoft isn't just a software company these days. Its Azure unit is the second-largest cloud computing infrastructure provider in the world, with 25% of the market. Microsoft has integrated new AI tools into Azure, and management said on the Q2 earnings call that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers -- a 60% increase from the prior-year period.\nMicrosoft will probably make another noteworthy AI investment soon. OpenAI is about to have another funding round, and Microsoft is reportedly going to participate. Keeping OpenAI close is a wise bet right now. Microsoft is already benefiting from the companies' close working relationship, and there's no reason to believe it won't continue to reap the rewards in the near future.\nAlphabet has long been a major player in artificial intelligence, mostly with behind-the-scenes tech. For example, AI is a fundamental part of the systems that provide its Google Search results and YouTube recommendations, which feed relevant content to users and help power its ad business.\nBut on the generative AI front, Alphabet had to play catch-up over the past two years, releasing its own AI model called Gemini to compete with ChatGPT, and integrating more AI-powered responses into its search results.\nSo far, Gemini appears to be a success. On Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call, management said that all six of its Workspace products, which have more than 2 billion users, are now using Gemini. Gemini is sold as an add-on feature to the company's suite of products.\nBut one of the biggest AI opportunities for Alphabet may be in cloud computing. Google Cloud is the third-largest cloud infrastructure provider (behind Amazon Web Services and Azure), and its artificial intelligence integrations are already paying off. Google Cloud sales increased 29% in the second quarter to $10.3 billion, and part of that growth came from \"increasing contribution from AI,\" according to Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat.\nAnd, just like Microsoft, Alphabet has made investments in AI start-ups. Most notable was its $2 billion investment in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which makes the popular AI chatbot Claude. The investment should help Alphabet keep abreast of the newest AI capabilities coming from start-ups.\nWhile both of these companies could be good long-term AI plays, I think Microsoft has an edge over Alphabet for two reasons.\nFirst, Microsoft has a 49% ownership stake in OpenAI, which is arguably the leading generative AI software company right now. The decision to hitch its wagon to OpenAI's tech already looks like a smart one, and Microsoft could continue to benefit as OpenAI releases more advanced models and new services down the road.\nSecond, while Alphabet will benefit from selling AI services for Google Cloud, Microsoft is a larger cloud company and will probably see more benefit from AI-related demand. Goldman Sachs estimates cloud revenue from all tech companies could climb to $2 trillion by 2030, and much of the growth will be fueled by AI. With Microsoft already holding a quarter of the cloud market, it's well positioned to benefit.\nMicrosoft trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 32, which is more expensive than Alphabet's forward P/E of 17.6. \u200b\u200bWhile I'd usually prefer to pick the stock that's technically less expensive, I think Microsoft has enough of a jump on its rivals in the AI space that it could outperform them in the software and cloud computing arenas for years to come.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of\u00a0 AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Latest reports indicate that OpenAI, the generative artificial intelligence startup backed by Microsoft,\u00a0 has crossed the 1 million paid users barrier in the ChatGPT for business section. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 to kickstart the AI boom. The tech giant has invested more than $10 billion in the AI startup already, and is potentially considering another large investment, along with Apple and NVIDIA, as the valuation of the startup touches close to $100 billion. OpenAI is considering higher-priced subscriptions to ChatGPT, perhaps $2,000 per month, as it launches new models like Strawberry and Orion.\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria recently downgraded Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $475. In a research note, the analyst noted that competition had largely caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduced the justification for the current premium valuation. The note further claimed that Microsoft's lead had now diminished in both the cloud business and code generation business, which would make it hard for shares to continue to outperform.\nOverall MSFT ranks 6th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news.

        "Author": "  Ashar Jawad ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ\u2019s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\nWith that said, let\u2019s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\nWe scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, which is best known for its software products and operating systems. It has nearly tripled its valuation over the last three years and reached the $3 trillion mark. It is the second most valuable corporation in the world.\nAccording to Insider Monkey's database, 279 hedge funds held stakes in the company as of the second quarter of 2024. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to garner immense investor confidence through its strong financial performance. During Q4 2024, the company generated a revenue of $64.7 billion, which took the annual revenue to $245 billion, representing a 15% increase year-over-year. EPS for the quarter registered a 10% growth to reach $2.95 per share, beating analysts' expectations of $2.94.\nThese robust results were largely driven by Microsoft Cloud, which contributed $135 billion of the company\u2019s overall revenue in FY2024, up 23% YoY. The company\u2019s commercial bookings also registered a 17% increase, driven by millions of dollars of contracts for both Microsoft 365 and Azure, indicating strong customer commitment. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) anticipates the trends to continue in FY25 and has projected double-digit growth for both revenue and operating income for the year.\nAnother reason behind investor confidence is the company\u2019s increased spending on AI and cloud infrastructure. Microsoft spent $19 billion in capital expenditure in Q4 alone, and investors believe that this increased spending will help the company stay at par with, if not outperform, competitors in the market. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses, both large and small, navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all scales. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and the adoption of innovative, AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low-double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\nThere were some segments where revenue decreased. Xbox hardware sales declined 42% during the quarter and devices revenue also experienced an 11% dip. However, the company believes this was due to their focus being more on other premium products with a higher profit margin. On the whole, there is consensus among Street analysts about Microsoft being one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. It has a\u00a0Strong Buy rating and a 12.60% upward potential in share price.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Vasundhara Sawalka ",
        "Text": "Though Microsoft MSFT has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), its stock has lagged behind the broader market. With an 8.8% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index\u2019s return of 20.7% and 18.4%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether Microsoft's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance.Microsoft has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and integrating AI capabilities across its product suite. This strategic move has positioned Microsoft as a leader in the AI space, potentially opening up new revenue streams and enhancing existing ones. Despite these moves, investors seem to be taking a cautious stance, perhaps waiting for concrete evidence of how these AI initiatives will translate into revenue growth and profitability.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft is rapidly integrating AI across its product lineup, from search engines to cloud computing, leveraging AI to enhance its offerings and challenge competitors in various markets.One of Microsoft's boldest moves is the integration of ChatGPT-like capabilities into Bing, directly challenging Google's search dominance. This initiative, coupled with the expansion of Azure AI, Microsoft's cloud-based AI platform, demonstrates the company's commitment to AI-driven growth. Azure AI has seen remarkable adoption, with its customer base growing nearly 60% year over year to more than 60,000 clients. For fiscal first-quarter 2025, Microsoft projects Intelligent Cloud revenues between $28.6 billion and $28.9 billion, with Azure expected to achieve 28-29% revenue growth at constant currency.The company's productivity suite, Microsoft 365, is also benefiting from AI integration. Features like AI-powered writing assistance in Word and smart data analysis in Excel are enhancing user productivity, potentially leading to higher adoption rates and increased customer retention. These improvements could significantly impact Microsoft's recurring revenue streams.Microsoft's Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool, is making waves across various sectors. GitHub Copilot, adopted by over 77,000 organizations, including BBVA and FedEx, has seen 180% year-over-year growth, driving GitHub's revenues to a $2 billion annual run rate. The launch of Copilot+ PCs, featuring new system architecture and advanced silicon technology, promises to deliver breakthrough AI experiences and enhanced productivity. Recently, Microsoft expanded the Copilot+ PC portfolio with the introduction of a new silicon technology \u2014 AMD Ryzen AI 300 series and Intel Core Ultra 200V series.The integration of generative AI into Microsoft's Power Platform has enabled over 480,000 organizations to leverage AI capabilities, with monthly active users growing 40% year over year to 48 million. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is rapidly becoming indispensable for knowledge workers, with its daily users nearly doubling quarter over quarter.As Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, the challenge lies in translating these technological advancements into tangible financial results. Success will be measured by increased market share in search, accelerated growth in cloud services and improved adoption rates for productivity tools. Investors and industry watchers will be closely monitoring Microsoft's ability to leverage its AI capabilities into market-beating performance as the AI landscape evolves.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $277.39 billion, indicating 13.2% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.04, indicating 10.5% growth year over year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft's recent stock underperformance, despite its AI initiatives, highlights the complex factors influencing tech sector valuations. While the company pushes forward with AI integration across its product line, broader market concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to impact investor sentiment.The AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META making significant investments. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to AI-driven growth prospects across the industry.Microsoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.71X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.98X and its own historical median of 10.1X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.As Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Microsoft's 8.8% YTD gain appears modest compared to the broader market and industry performance, the company's aggressive moves in AI present a potential catalyst for future growth. The successful integration and monetization of AI across its product lines could open up new revenue streams, enhance Microsoft's competitive position and drive the stock further.\u00a0However, investors should also be mindful of the challenges, including intense competition and potential regulatory hurdles. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present. New investors should, however, wait for a better entry point for Microsoft.\u00a0You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  GlobalData Technology ",
        "Text": "At the Microsoft 365 Copilot (Copilot) \u2018Wave 2\u2019 event, the company announced several features for its generative AI (genAI) assistant that further cement Microsoft\u2019s leadership position in the team collaboration space.\nAlthough Microsoft is playing catch-up with some of the capabilities and generally releasing them long after they were first announced, collectively Microsoft\u2019s portfolio makes it a vendor to beat.\nThe range of introductions is striking. Microsoft has touched a roster of Microsoft 365 apps including Teams, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, and OneDrive. With genAI touching multiple points of its portfolio, Microsoft has taken the 'permeate the platform' approach adopted by competitors such as Cisco, Google, Zoom, and RingCentral.\nAlthough Microsoft has followed the herd in that respect, some of the features make it especially shine. Copilot agents (generally available) are a great example. The agents automate and execute business processes and range in sophistication from basic prompt-and-response agents to agents that replace repetitive tasks to agents that are fully autonomous.\nAnother important example is the narrative builder in PowerPoint that allows users to engage Copilot in an iterative process to quickly build a first-draft presentation triggered by an initial prompt. Similarly in Excel, data visualisation tools like charts and pivot tables can be created through an iterative partnership with Copilot; and, among other generally available capabilities, Copilot in Excel can also work with text in addition to numerical data.\nOut of everything Microsoft unveiled, the most compelling is Copilot Pages, a digital canvas for creating, editing, and sharing content. Teams can collaborate and stay organised in real time. Content can be sourced from internal data and files as well as the web. And in keeping with other apps discussed immediately above such as PowerPoint and Excel, Copilot plays an iterative role in the content creation process.\nWhile Copilot Pages stands out for its robustness and versatility, it is especially noteworthy for the flexibility and ease with which it combines information into a single environment to optimise collaboration and thereby increase productivity. Copilot Pages will be generally available for Microsoft 365 Copilot customers later in September 2024.\nThe event suffered flaws. Some features have already been introduced by key competitors. For example, Copilot Pages is essentially the same as \u2018Zoom Docs,\u2019 which launched in August 2024, and meeting summary and \u2018catch up\u2019 features announced for Teams have already been offered by Cisco for some time.\nAlso, several features were already revealed at the \u2018Ignite\u2019 event held nearly one year ago in November 2023, dramatically undercutting the thunder Microsoft had hoped for.\nThose flaws do not spoil the fact that Microsoft continues to push the needle on both the team collaboration and productivity fronts simultaneously. Except for Google, only Microsoft augments its team collaboration offerings with a suite of tools aimed squarely at driving up productivity (in the form of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.).\nThus, by truly marrying team collaboration and productivity functionality, Microsoft delivers a more holistic package and achieves a degree of differentiation that is largely unmatched.\n\"Microsoft promises \u2018wave\u2019 of 365 Copilot features but delivers a splash\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\u00a0Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nChris Hyzy, Merrill & Bank of America Private Bank chief investment officer, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that there is \u201c a lot of momentum\u201d behind the market rally. The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the \u201cwedge\u201d in the market.\n\u201cThe biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That\u2019s beginning to go away. It\u2019s almost to the fact that no one\u2019s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that\u2019s worrisome.\u201d\nHyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China \u201cjoining the party\u201d will be two key tailwinds for the market.\nAnswering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.\n\u201cWe have a lot of components of a soft landing. I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,\u201d Hyzy added.\nFor this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Microsoft 365 on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nSome believe OpenAI was the only key edge Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0had in the AI race and it\u2019s quickly fading away.\nDA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company\u2019s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum.\nLuria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA\u2019s, according to Luria.\nFollowing a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft\u2019s dependence on NVIDIA.\nLuria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins.\nThe analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.\nThe concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Assessing Its Strength Among the Best ESG Stocks to Buy Now",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other ESG stocks.\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it\u2019s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn\u2019t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45\u00b0C\u2014closer than ever to the 1.5\u00b0C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists\u2019 initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\u201cIf you solely look at climate as your window, you\u2019ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.\u201d\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market\u2019s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as \u201cwoke\u201d investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren\u2019t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 6.79%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands out as a leading ESG stock, much in part due to its strategic investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which has strengthened its position across hardware, software, and global cloud services. The company is committed to sourcing 100% renewable energy by 2025, becoming carbon negative by 2030, and offsetting all historical carbon emissions since its founding in 1975 by 2050.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently dipped after the company\u2019s latest quarterly results revealed slower-than-expected growth in its Cloud business. For the current quarter, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) projects revenue between $63.8 billion and $64.8 billion, slightly below the $65.07 billion estimate, with Azure revenue anticipated to grow by 28% to 29% year over year. Additionally, the company\u2019s Office commercial customer sales surged to $48 billion, marking a significant increase from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely fueled by the adoption of Copilot Pro subscriptions.\nBMO Capital Markets maintained its positive outlook on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), keeping an Outperform rating and a $500 price target. The firm emphasized Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s strong position in artificial intelligence and its diverse product portfolio as key reasons for its top pick status. Although BMO acknowledged a less-than-stellar June quarter report and guidance for about 29% year-over-year growth in Azure for the September quarter, Microsoft\u2019s management projected an acceleration in Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025 during the last earnings call. BMO\u2019s analysis suggests that while Azure\u2019s growth has been limited by capacity constraints in recent quarters, these challenges are expected to ease in the latter half of FY25, supported by a strong demand pipeline.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top absolute contributors were Alphabet,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure\u2019s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Investors Heavily Search Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +5.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share, indicating a change of +3.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.02 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $64.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14%. The $277.6 billion and $315.06 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.3% and +13.5%, respectively.\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.84%. The EPS surprise was +1.72%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Microsoft lays off another 650 in gaming division, bringing the total to 2,550",
        "Author": "  Chris Morris ",
        "Text": "Microsoft is making even more cuts to the staff roster of its Xbox gaming division.\nThe company on Thursday announced plans to lay off 650 employees, which will bring the total number of job losses since its October 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard to 2,550.\nThe latest round of cuts will largely impact corporate and support roles. No studios are being closed and no games or game systems will be cancelled as a result of the belt-tightening. (Microsoft closed Tango Gameworks, makers of Hi-Fi Rush, and Redfall developer Arkane Austin in previous layoff rounds, which did impact its upcoming titles.)\n\u201cThroughout our team\u2019s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones,\u201d wrote Phil Spencer, chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, in an email announcing the cuts. \u201cToday is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s layoffs have been among the most high-profile, given the number of people impacted and the company\u2019s prominent standing, but it\u2019s hardly the only gamemaker struggling today. The industry, as a whole, is in a slump following a tremendous surge in consumer interest during the pandemic.\nMore than 11,500 people in the video game industry have lost their jobs in 2024. That\u2019s more than the entirety of 2023 (10,500) and 2022 (8,500).\nSales of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox were down substantially in the latest financial quarter, though Microsoft has been less focused on game hardware and more on its GamePass game streaming service in the past year. It raised prices for that service in July, and in February disclosed it had 34 million subscribers.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "As we have been writing for the better part of the last year, the next AI trade continues to look like it's going to be energy. And now, both BlackRock and Microsoft are making it known that they understand this, too.\nYesterday it was reported that the two industry giants are prepping the launch of a $30 billion AI investment fund that'll see Microsoft build data centers and energy projects to meet the demands of AI, according to the Financial Times.\nBlackRock\u2019s new infrastructure investment unit, Global Infrastructure Partners, is launching a major investment fund with Microsoft and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX as general partners. Nvidia will provide advisory on factory design and integration.\nThe FT wrote that the partnership aims to tackle the massive power and infrastructure needs of AI development, which is expected to strain current energy systems. AI\u2019s computing demands far exceed past technologies.\nThe partnership seeks to raise up to $30bn in equity, with plans to leverage an additional $70bn in debt.\nIn a statement, Larry Fink said: \u201cMobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity.\u201d\nBrad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, added: \u201cThe country and the world are going to need more capital investment to accelerate the development of the AI infrastructure needed. This kind of effort is an important step.\u201d\nJensen Huang of Nvidia added: \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.\u201d\nThe upcoming fund is the latest by a major asset manager to address the rising energy needs of generative AI and cloud computing. Earlier this year, Microsoft committed $10bn to renewable energy projects with Brookfield Asset Management and aims for 100% zero-carbon energy by 2030, the Financial Times concluded.\nThe International Energy Agency predicts global electricity consumption by data centers could exceed 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than double the 2022 level.\nIn the U.S., which houses a third of the world\u2019s data centers, electricity demand is surging for the first time in 20 years. A report from Grid Strategies shows five-year electricity demand projections in the U.S. have nearly doubled, from 2.6% to 4.7%.\nFor those who missed it, in our note \"The Next AI Trade\" from April of this year, we outlined various investment opportunities for powering up America, most of which have dramatically outperformed the market.\nA favorite name of ours has been the Sam Altman-backed Oklo, which we have highlighted as the potential solution to the extreme forthcoming demands in energy as a result of artificial intelligence.

        "Author": "  Neha Gupta ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other forever stocks to buy now.\nInvestment opportunities are increasingly cropping up as volatility in the equity markets edge higher in response to changes in the investment environment. Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fueling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value. Additionally, they boast a competitive edge in their respective industries by investing billions of dollars in research and development. In addition, the companies are increasingly spearheading industrial trends and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.\nOur Methodology\nThe best forever stocks offer stability and growth, making them ideal for long-term investors.

(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech powerhouse best known for providing some of the most sought-after software, including Windows and Office, among others. It\u2019s also a big player in cloud computing, with Microsoft Azure, while flexing its muscles in the multi-billion gaming business through the Xbox product line.\nThe company has also poured billions into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and has integrated AI into numerous of its products. Its AI investments have once again strengthened its productivity tools, including Azure Office and Xbox gaming, but it has also strengthened its growth metrics.\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best forever stocks to buy now as it regularly achieves strong financial results, and its most recent quarter was no exception. Its income from sales and operating earnings both rose by 15% compared to the previous year, showing remarkable performance for a company of its stature. Its earnings per share (EPS) reached $2.95, surpassing analysts\u2019 predictions. This figure is also more than twice as high as it was five years prior.\nOne of the catalysts behind Microsoft\u2019s robust growth is its cloud unit, Azure, which has received a significant boost amid AI integrations. With a 31% market share, it remains well-positioned data to generate significant value amid strong demand for cloud solutions.\nAdditionally, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) has consistently returned value to investors through dividends. The stock currently yields 0.7% with a quarterly dividend of about $0.75 per share, one of the biggest among the tech giants.\nThe company\u2019s P/E ratio stands at 32, indicating a high valuation, consistent with its status as a leading technology firm. The company also remains in a solid financial position, with $23.32 billion in total free cash flow as of the end of June.\n279 hedge funds hold long positions in Microsoft Corp.

The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall MSFT\u00a0ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best undervalued cyclical stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Microsoft Stock Now?",
        "Author": "  Collin Brantmeyer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) investors have been rewarded handsomely over the past five years with an impressive total return of 225%, outpacing the market benchmark S&P 500 by approximately 120%. Any time a company as large as Microsoft surges in a relatively short period, investors are reasonable to ask how much larger the company can get.\nSo, let's examine the tech giant's recent financial results, capital allocation strategy, and artificial intelligence opportunity to determine whether Microsoft's stock has room to run or has reached its ceiling.\nGiven Microsoft's massive market capitalization of $3.2 trillion, it should come as no surprise that the company is setting records for its top and bottom lines. In its fiscal 2024, Microsoft reported $245.1 billion in revenue and $88.1 billion in net income. By contrast, in its fiscal 2023, it earned $211.9 billion in revenue and $72.4 billion in net income, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15.7% and 21.8%, respectively.\nA portion of that growth was partly due to Microsoft's purchase of gaming leader Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in late 2023. However, even with that large acquisition, Microsoft's balance sheet remains healthy, with $29.3 billion in net cash.\nCompanies use two methods to return capital to shareholders: dividends and share repurchases. Microsoft participates in both.\nManagement recently announced it would raise its quarterly dividend by 10% from $0.75 to $0.83 per share. Including the new increase, Microsoft will have paid and raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years. The new dividend will represent a forward annual yield of 0.76%.\nFor any dividend-paying stock, investors should monitor its payout ratio, which compares the percentage of a company's earnings paid out as dividends. According to research from S&P Global, stocks with a payout ratio below 75% are considered safe and have a history of outperformance when coupled with annual raises. Microsoft's trailing-12-month payout ratio is 24.7%, so investors can reasonably expect dividend raises in the future, especially given management's consistent track record of increasing them.\nMicrosoft also announced that it authorized a new share repurchase program worth up to $60 billion in addition to its current program, which had $10.3 remaining as of June 30. Reducing the number of outstanding shares boosts the ownership stakes of existing shareholders and is a more tax-efficient way of returning capital than dividends. Microsoft has reduced its outstanding share count by 10% over the past decade.\nGiven the size of Microsoft, any significant growth may need to come from new avenues. For Microsoft, that comes in the form of artificial intelligence (AI), which the company has poured billions into recently. Microsoft invested a reported $13 billion in OpenAI, the company behind the transformative generative AI product ChatGPT. In return, Microsoft will receive \"preferential treatment when it comes to OpenAI profits,\" according to Fortune. More recently, Microsoft announced a new $30 billion fund in partnership with BlackRock to invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects.\nMicrosoft is also scaling its AI infrastructure with data centers and servers to meet its customers' needs across its product offerings. The company spent a quarterly high-water mark of $19 billion in capital expenditures for its fiscal year Q4 to fund its new developments, and it appears it's only the beginning. On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella added, \"To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY '25 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY '24.\" For reference, Microsoft spent $55.7 billion in capital expenditures for its fiscal year 2024, which was 75% higher than its fiscal year 2023.\nWhile Microsoft's AI bet is still in its early stages, the gamble is showing early signs of a payoff. Notably, Microsoft now has 60,000 Azure AI customers, up 60% year over year; 14,000 paid customers for its next-generation data platform, Microsoft Fabric; and 48 million monthly active users of its Power Platform, up 40% year over year.\nMicrosoft's stock is trading at 37.2 times earnings, higher than its five-year median price-to-earnings ratio of 33.7, indicating a relatively expensive valuation.\nStill, given the company's position as a market leader and the possibilities regarding the AI revolution, investors should consider adding Microsoft to their portfolio. For those worried about the valuation, consider dollar-cost-averaging your position to ease concerns about Microsoft's lofty stock price in the short term.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is a Trending Stock",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nMicrosoft is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 points to a change of +10.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.02 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $64.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14%. The $277.39 billion and $314.94 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.2% and +13.5%, respectively.\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.84%. The EPS surprise was +1.72%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Philip Blenkinsop ",
        "Text": "By Philip Blenkinsop\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Alphabet unit Google filed a complaint to the European Commission on Wednesday against what it said were Microsoft's anti-competitive practices to lock customers into Microsoft's cloud platform Azure.\nGoogle, whose biggest cloud computing rivals are Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, said Microsoft was exploiting its dominant Windows Server operating system to prevent competition.\nGoogle Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery told a briefing that Microsoft made customers pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators. This did not apply if they used Azure. Users of rival cloud systems would also get later and more limited security updates, Zavery said.\nGoogle pointed to a 2023 study by cloud services organisation CISPE which found that European businesses and public sector bodies were paying up to 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) per year on Microsoft licensing penalties.\nMicrosoft in July clinched a 20-million-euro deal to settle an antitrust complaint about its cloud computing licensing practices with CISPE, averting an EU investigation. However, the settlement did not include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform and AliCloud, prompting criticism from the first two companies.\nMicrosoft said it had settled amicably similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, adding that Google had hoped they would keep litigating.\n\"Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement.\nGoogle said Microsoft had locked customers into using collaboration application Teams even when they preferred alternatives and was using the same playbook for Azure.\n\"The time to act is now,\" Zavery said. \"The cloud market will get more and more restrictive if things don't happen now.\"\nGoogle said that only regulatory action would end Microsoft's \"vendor lock\" and level the playing field for competitors.\n\"We are asking the European Commission to act now. We're asking them to really look at this issue, help customers decide and keep the choices going for them,\" Zavery said.\nGoogle said Microsoft's Windows Server and various Microsoft products had a market share of over 70% in European businesses.\nFor years, Microsoft allowed its products to work on any hardware, such as laptops, but placed restrictions in 2019 as it entered the cloud business.\nThe cloud computing business is growing at around 20% per year in the EU, with plenty of potential. A McKinsey study in April showed that two-thirds of EU companies had less than half of their workloads on the cloud.\n($1 = 0.8943 euros)\n(Reporting by Philip BlenkinsopEditing by Tomasz Janowski, Kirsten Donovan)\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- The owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania will invest $1.6 billion to revive it, agreeing to sell all the output to Microsoft Corp. as the tech titan seeks carbon-free electricity for data centers to power the artificial intelligence boom.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes\nWaiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\nExclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\nNY\u2019s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\nConstellation Energy Corp., the biggest US operator of reactors, expects Three Mile Island to go back into service in 2028, according to a statement Friday. While one of the site\u2019s two units permanently closed almost a half-century ago after the worst US nuclear accident, Constellation is planning to reopen the other reactor, which shut in 2019 because it couldn\u2019t compete economically.\nShares of Constellation Energy jumped as much as 22%, the most on record, to an all-time high on Friday.\nMicrosoft has agreed to purchase the energy for two decades and declined to disclose financial terms. This is the first time Microsoft has secured a dedicated, 100% nuclear facility for its use.\nThe decision is the latest sign of surging interest in the nuclear industry as power demand for AI soars. More than a dozen reactors went dark over roughly the past decade in the face of increasing competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. But growing demand for electricity \u2014 from factories, cars and especially from data centers \u2014 has spurred interest in nuclear plants that can provide carbon-free power around the clock.\n\u201cPolicymakers and the market have received a huge wake-up call,\u201d Constellation Chief Executive Officer Joe Dominguez said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no version of the future of this country that doesn\u2019t rely on these nuclear assets.\u201d\nConstellation \u2014 which has seen its shares jump this year thanks to mounting investor awareness of the value of power plants \u2014 plans to fund the project from its own coffers rather than seek state or federal support. That\u2019s in contrast to Holtec International, which is pursuing the only other disclosed effort to restart a closed reactor, with about $1.8 billion in conditional funding from the US Energy Department and the state of Michigan. NextEra Energy Inc. has also said it\u2019s considering reviving a closed Iowa reactor, in part to supply data-center customers. However, beyond these three, experts say there are few other mothballed reactors that may be suitable for restarting.\nWhile Constellation isn\u2019t averse to outside financial support, Dominguez said government approvals move slowly and he doesn\u2019t want to wait. Work at Three Mile Island is expected to start immediately. The deal to supply Microsoft with electricity from the 837-megawatt reactor is Constellation\u2019s biggest-ever power purchase deal.\nThe restart effort has been in the works since early 2023, when Constellation began evaluating whether it made sense to switch the reactor back on. By early this year, the company had concluded that it wanted to pursue the project, and began talking to potential customers. Microsoft was immediately interested, Dominguez said.\nThe nuclear power purchase will aid Microsoft\u2019s plans to run all of its massive global network of data centers on clean energy by 2025, Bobby Hollis, Microsoft\u2019s vice president for energy, said in an interview. This nuclear energy will be used to fuel data-center expansion in areas like Chicago, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\nWhile the additional nuclear power will help Microsoft\u2019s climate goals, it does not address the most intractable issue \u2013 emissions from concrete, steel and chips used in the data centers, Hollis said.\n\u201cThis is not a simple piece, but it\u2019s easier than figuring out how to decarbonize the entire supply chain,\u201d he said.\nStill, data centers make a useful customer for nuclear power. Wind and solar power outputs can vary, while a nuclear plant generally runs constantly and requires a customer that can take all of that electricity, Hollis said. That makes tech companies selling cloud computing an ideal option.\n\u201cWe run around the clock. They run around the clock,\u201d he said.\nMicrosoft isn't the only tech company looking to nuclear power to fuel its AI ambitions. Earlier this year, Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud computing division agreed to spend $650 million to acquire a data center campus connected to Talen Energy Corp.\u2019s 40-year-old nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.\nWhile the Three Mile Island reactor was mothballed in 2019, Dominguez said the equipment is still in good shape. Still, restarting it will require significant investments in the main transformer, turbine and cooling systems. The company will have to restaff the facility and must seek approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Constellation will also seek to extend its operating license through 2054, and is planning to rename the facility the Crane Clean Energy Center, after the late Chris Crane, former CEO of Exelon Corp., which spun out its generation unit to become Constellation in 2022.\nOne of the biggest hurdles will be connecting the plant to the power grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, which has a lengthy queue. If PJM can move fast enough, Dominguez said the facility could potentially be ready to supply power as early as 2027.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re reversing a terrible mistake that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a lot more difficult to achieve the energy transition if we only want to use wind and solar and storage.\u201d\n(Updates with share move in third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Activision and Blizzard\u2019s Corporate Warcraft\nThis Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "Title": "Which Tech Stock Is Better: Apple or Microsoft?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "In this article, I evaluate two leading technology stocks, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), to determine which is the better investment. In preview, I have a neutral view of Apple and a bullish outlook on Microsoft.\nApple is known for its popular consumer electronics such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook computer. The company also provides digital content via its App Store, Apple TV, and the Apple Card payment service. Microsoft is known for the Windows personal computer (PC) operating system, its Office 365 software suite, the Xbox video game console, and its Azure cloud computing platform.\nAAPL stock has risen 13% year-to-date and is up 22% over the last year. Microsoft\u2019s share price has gained 15% year-to-date and is up 32% over the past 12 months. These share price performances make Apple and Microsoft the laggards of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d technology stocks, with only Tesla (TSLA) performing worse. AAPL and MSFT stocks have also underperformed the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index that is up nearly 20% this year.\nThe valuation of Apple stock has a lot to do with my neutral view. Currently, AAPL is trading at 32 times future earnings estimates, which is less than the average price/earnings ratio of 44 among technology stocks. MSFT is also trading at a higher multiple of 36 times future earnings expectations. Additionally, Apple\u2019s stock has been largely trading sideways since June of this year. Because of this, a neutral view of the stock seems appropriate.\nThere are also concerns about iPhone sales to consider. When the company launched the iPhone 16 earlier in September, AAPL stock jumped. However, there have been reports about weak sales immediately following the newest iPhone\u2019s public unveiling. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that iPhone 16 demand is weak, dropping 12% compared to last year\u2019s iPhone 15 launch.\nKuo and other analysts have also expressed disappointment with the lack of new features on the iPhone 16. One of the most anticipated features, the company\u2019s AI application known as \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d won\u2019t launch until October of this year and is only in a beta format. Of course, Apple remains a strong company overall, and the current iPhone slump is likely temporary. However, patient investors might be able to buy the stock at a more attractive share price in the coming weeks if iPhone 16 sales disappoint.\nApple has a consensus rating of Moderate Buy among 32 Wall Street analysts. There are currently 23 Buy ratings, eight Hold ratings, and one Sell recommendation assigned to the stock. At $249.46, the average Apple stock price target implies upside potential of 15.39%.\nRead more analyst ratings on AAPL stock\nThere are many reasons to be bullish on MSFT stock. Like Apple, Microsoft is trading at a discount to the technology sector. Microsoft\u2019s stock has been in decline in recent months, falling 7% since early July. Some of that decline has been reversed on news that the company is raising its dividend by 10% and has approved a new $60 billion stock buyback program, boosting shareholder returns in the process. The company raised its dividend from $0.75 to $0.83 per share, payable on Dec. 12 of this year.\nMicrosoft also continues to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, capturing market share in both fast-growing segments. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform continues to grow at a brisk clip and is more all-encompassing than Apple\u2019s upcoming AI features for the iPhone.\nMicrosoft has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on the views of 30 Wall Street analysts. This is comprised of 29 Buy and one Hold rating on the company\u2019s stock. No Sell ratings have been assigned over the last three months. At $501.15, the average price target on Microsoft stock implies upside potential of 16.16%.\nRead more analyst ratings on MSFT stock\nApple and Microsoft could be long-term additions to any portfolio. However, Microsoft is preferred based on the company\u2019s leadership role in AI and future growth potential. The fact that the company raised its dividend payout to shareholders and initiated a $60 billion share repurchase program are other reasons to like MSFT stock. Apple, on the other hand, is struggling with weak iPhone demand and to clarify its AI strategy. As such, I remain bullish on MSFT stock and neutral on AAPL stock.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. It is hard to find established technology companies that offer a reliable path to AI growth. Microsoft, however, is an exception. The firm recently released results for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, topping market expectations on revenue by 15% year-on-year growth and operating income that came close to $28 billion. For those looking at ROI on AI, the numbers for Azure painted a healthy pattern, with AI workloads contributing to 30% year-on-year growth in the segment. The services and GitHub Copilot showed strong performance as well. Although the long-term outlook remains rosy, AI capex is likely to weigh on investor sentiment in the near term.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the favorite AI stocks on Wall Street. DA Davidson recently maintained a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $475, noting that the commentary from management suggested that demand for AI services remained strong as Azure continues to gain market share, and Azure demand levels were likely to remain similar throughout the upcoming fiscal year.\nOverall MSFT ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner.\u00a0Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBrad Gerstner, the founder of\u00a0Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\u201cSince 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it\u2019s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,\u201d Gerstner said.\nGerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.\n\u201cAs a professional investor, we\u2019re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,\u201d he said.\nFor this article we scanned Altimeter Capital\u2019s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Microsoft Edge on Unsplash\nBrad Gerstner\u2019s Stake: $726,579,798\nMicrosoft is among the top AI picks of Altimeter as of Q2.\nHowever, some believe OpenAI was the only key edge Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) had in the AI race and it\u2019s quickly fading away.\nDA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company\u2019s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum.\nLuria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA\u2019s, according to Luria.\nFollowing a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft\u2019s dependence on NVIDIA.\nLuria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins.\nThe analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.\nThe concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks You Can\u2019t Ignore.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against Jim Cramer's top stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current divide between tech stocks and other sectors, highlighting their tendency to move in opposite directions. For example, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 228 points and the S&P 500 went up by 0.13%, the NASDAQ, which is heavily influenced by tech stocks, dropped by 0.52%. Cramer thinks it's because there isn\u2019t enough new money flowing into the market.\n\"How did we get to this bizarre dichotomy between tech stocks and pretty much everything else, where the two groups now almost always seem to move in opposite directions? Take today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points, the S&P advanced 0.13%, but the NASDAQ\u2014with all that tech in it\u2014dropped a bomb. Yes, it fell 0.52%. How could there be such a schism?\"\nAs a result, large institutions need to move their investments between sectors since they can\u2019t invest in both at once. This shift is due to market mechanics rather than fundamental news. When stocks are already doing well, it\u2019s difficult to attract new investment, especially when safer options provide attractive returns. Therefore, either tech stocks or other sectors will perform well, but not both simultaneously.\n\"It\u2019s because there\u2019s not enough money coming in from the sidelines, so these big institutions have to swap out of one group if they want to buy stock in another. Yet this action has nothing to do with fundamentals; it\u2019s not about the news, it\u2019s about pure market mechanics. When stocks are already red hot, it\u2019s hard to attract new capital from the sidelines, especially when you can get a cozy 4% return for doing nothing. So, either tech wins or everything else wins, but there\u2019s not enough cash for both of them to win at the same time.\"\nCramer notes that this situation results in distinct winners and losers, rather than a range of performance on a positive day. This is occurring amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in their upcoming meeting. Cramer also notes that, despite his usual reluctance to speculate on the Fed\u2019s decisions, recent market movements have been swayed by expectations of rate cuts. For example, when The Wall Street Journal indicated the Fed might choose a 50 basis point reduction, there was a notable shift towards cyclical stocks, particularly those related to housing. This shift, along with other positive news, contributed to the market's best week of the year.\n\"What happens? We get winners and losers\u2014not big winners and smaller winners, as you would normally expect on an up day like today. This is all against the backdrop of the big question: will the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points or 50 when it meets on Wednesday?\nThis leads me to this newfound great divide between tech and non-tech, because that\u2019s how this market seems to be trading. It\u2019s a big reason why I\u2019m out here in Silicon Valley this week. Today, we saw a market that doesn\u2019t believe in AI, or tech in general for that matter. It\u2019s a market that believes a 50-basis-point rate cut will shift money from semiconductors to housing and anything housing-related, and people want to get ahead of that.\"\nJim Cramer noted that Monday\u2019s market saw a wide range of winners. Healthcare stocks, retailers, and consumer packaged goods companies all did well, and even oil stocks, which have been lagging, are rebounding. This is unusual because typically when cyclical stocks rise, sectors like healthcare and consumer products would drop. Cramer explains this trend as part of a broader market shift he calls \"ABT,\" or \"anything but tech.\" Essentially, today's market is focusing on sectors outside of technology.\n\"Today, the winners broadened out. The healthcare stocks got jiggy, retailers worked, and consumer packaged goods companies outperformed. Even the much-maligned oils are rallying. It\u2019s crazy\u2014healthcare and consumer products should be selling off when cyclicals rally, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening because it\u2019s *ABT*. No, I\u2019m not talking about the symbol for Abbott Labs. ABT means \u201canything but tech,\u201d and that\u2019s what today\u2019s market was about.\nThe implications are pretty stark, folks. Market commentators call this a rotation, but that understates what\u2019s really happening here because the move is so vicious and devoid of realism. The market\u2019s action is dictating what we do. For example, we know that the principal beneficiaries of rate cuts are the housing stocks, which rallied again today. This is the second day these stocks jumped as rates continue to plummet. But today, day two, was zero-sum.\"\nTech stocks also experienced notable gains because of key events. For example, Larry Ellison from Oracle reported strong earnings and emphasized the need for many additional data centers.\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, where he discussed various stocks. We have selected the ten most notable companies he mentioned and ranked them based on their ownership levels by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don\u2019t waste time with underperformers\u2014they target the market's elite.\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%\u20135.00% from 5.25%\u20135.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024\u2014the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\u201cRight now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we\u2019re on our way back to 2%. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.\u201d\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed\u2019s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 34\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech giant renowned for its popular software offerings, including Windows and Office, as well as being a key player in cloud computing through Microsoft Azure. Additionally, the tech giant has invested billions in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and has integrated AI across many of its products.\nIn fiscal Q4 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported $64.7 billion in revenue, a 15% increase year-over-year. Net income rose 10% YoY to $22 billion. A major driver of this growth is Microsoft Azure, which has benefitted from AI integrations. With a 31% market share, Azure is poised to generate substantial value amid strong demand for cloud solutions.\nMizuho recently reiterated its positive outlook on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $480. The endorsement followed Microsoft's announcement of a new $60 billion share buyback program, matching the previous plan set three years ago. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by nearly 11%, continuing a six-year trend of dividend growth.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) tops the list of the 10 best stocks to buy, with 34 billionaires holding stakes in the company as of the June 2024 quarter.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the stocks to invest in according to billionaires.

        "Author": "  Jeffrey Dastin ",
        "Text": "By Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft has given its consumer Copilot, an artificial intelligence assistant, a more amiable voice in its latest update, with the chatbot also capable of analyzing web pages for interested users as they browse.\nThe U.S. software maker now has \"an entire army\" of creative directors - among them psychologists, novelists and comedians - finessing the tone and style of Copilot to distinguish it, Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, told Reuters in an interview.\nIn one demonstration of the updated Copilot, a consumer asked what housewarming gift to buy at a grocery store for a friend who did not drink wine. After some back-and-forth, Copilot said aloud: \"Italian (olive) oils are the hot stuff right now. Tuscan's my go-to. Super peppery.\"\nThe feature rollout, starting Tuesday, is one of the first that Suleyman has overseen since Microsoft created his division in March to focus on consumer products and technology research.\nLong identified with business software, Microsoft has had a much harder road in the consumer realm. Its Bing search engine, for instance, is still dwarfed by Google.\nSuleyman is hoping for a bigger splash with Copilot, which launched last year in a crowded field of AI chatbots, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\nCopilot's newly fashioned voice capabilities make it seem much more of an active listener, giving verbal cues like \"cool\" and \"huh,\" Suleyman said.\nUnderlying the product are Microsoft AI, or \"MAI,\" models, plus a technology suite from partner OpenAI, Suleyman said.\nSuleyman added that consumers who spend $20 monthly for Copilot Pro can start testing a \"Think Deeper\" feature that reasons through choices, like whether to move to one city or another.\nHe said an additional test feature for paying subscribers, Copilot Vision, amounts to \"digital pointing\" - the ability for users to talk to AI about what they see in a Microsoft Edge browser. Consumers have to opt in, and the content they view will not be saved or used to train AI, Microsoft said.\nThese updates represent \"glimmers\" of AI that can be an \"ever-present confidant, in your corner,\" Suleyman said. It's a vision he articulated as CEO of Inflection AI, whose top talent Microsoft poached in a closely watched deal this year.\nSuleyman said that eventually, Copilot will learn context from consumers' Word documents, Windows desktops, even their gaming consoles if they grant permission.\nAsked what Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, thinks of the company's AI efforts, Suleyman said Gates was excited.\n\"He's always asking me about when Copilot can read and parse his emails. It's one of his favorite ones,\" Suleyman said. \"We're on the case.\"\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

The competition for electricity has even led to increases in how long it takes to connect new data centers to the power grid, with the time period in Virginia\u2019s Data Center Alley stretching to as much as seven years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear today that the availability of power is one of the constraints on building not just data centers but electrification in general,\u201d Ogunlesi said in the interview. \u201cPower generation in the US has not been growing dramatically, so we will have to significantly increase the pace at which we develop new renewable power plants.\u201d\nMicrosoft has also been talking with OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman, who\u2019s developing his own plans for groups of investors and tech companies to collaborate on ways to dramatically expand computing infrastructure for AI products.\nThe Financial Times reported on the partnership earlier.\n--With assistance from Robin Ajello, Josh Saul and Ian King.\n(Updates with Fink comment in third paragraph, Microsoft president in seventh.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nIn Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\nXbox\u2019s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming\nWhy Get An MBA?

        "Title": "Microsoft Just Raised Its Dividend By Double Digits: What Investors Need to Know",
        "Author": "  Billy Duberstein, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Dividends that can grow above the rate of inflation for years can be huge wealth-builders over time.\nAlthough artificial intelligence (AI) stocks aren't exactly known for their dividends, some of these tech giants are now beginning to pay out dividends and to grow them by double-digit percentages.\nIn fact, on Monday, the oldest dividend payer of the big AI tech stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), announced a dividend increase of more than 10%. Here are the essential things to know about Redmond's new bigger payout to owners.\nMicrosoft announced it would raise its quarterly payout from $0.75 to $0.83, good for a 10.7% increase. The hike will go into effect for the December dividend payout, which will go to holders of the stock as of Nov. 20, with an ex-dividend date of Nov. 21.\nHowever, the new dividend yield at today's share price would only amount to roughly 0.8%.\nIn addition to the dividend hike, Microsoft also authorized a $60 billion share buyback program. When a company repurchases its shares, that lowers the share count, increasing the remaining shareholders' stake in the company. Note that while that amount seems large, $60 billion in repurchases would only retire a small fraction (about 2%) of Microsoft shares at today's market cap.\nWhile that shareholder return may seem paltry to some, this year's increases should be repeatable and sustainable. This is because even though the dividend hike was strong at nearly 11%, Microsoft's diluted earnings per share actually grew 22% over the past fiscal year.\nHence, Microsoft's dividend payout ratio in relation to earnings will actually go down. That means more room for payout increases in the future.\nAlso underpinning consistent growth is Microsoft's impeccable balance sheet, with $75 billion in cash against just $50 billion in short- and long-term debt. That cash hoard remains after the massive $69 billion all-cash acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which closed last December.\nThe Activision acquisition should bolster earnings even more in the year ahead, as it really only affected half of Microsoft's past fiscal year. But Microsoft's main businesses -- its AI-powered cloud computing and business productivity software segments -- will determine most of its earnings growth.\nWhile all these factors are positive, it's possible Microsoft won't lavish that entire $60 billion of repurchases on investors this year. Cash flow may be a concern, given that all the cloud giants are currently spending heavily on AI data centers. Of note, Microsoft's free cash flow amounted to $74 billion last year, markedly below its net income of $88.9 billion.\nMicrosoft spent $13.9 billion in cash on capital expenditures in the fourth quarter -- and if that continues, an annual pace of $56 billion would be a marked increase from last year's $44.5 billon. That number is likely to run higher for fiscal 2025, as the AI races show no signs of slowing down.\nThe company is also likely to generate more AI-related revenue in the year ahead. For instance, it's charging $30 per seat for the AI-powered Copilot version of Microsoft 365. On Microsoft's recent conference call, CEO Satya Nadella noted that the number of Office 365 Copilot users grew 60% quarter over quarter, and that Copilot for GitHub contributed 40% of that segment's growth. Still, any success in AI would likely lead to more spending on AI data centers, making free cash flow lower than earnings again this year.\nLooking back at the past year, Microsoft only spent $17.2 billion on share repurchases, which was even lower than the $22.2 billion spent in the prior year. So, it seems unlikely it will repurchase $60 billion worth this year. While last year's conservatism made room for the Activision purchase, it may also have been intended to save cash for heavy AI investments. Additionally, Microsoft's stock isn't exactly screamingly cheap at 36.5 times earnings, limiting the effect of repurchases.\nBoth the AI-related spending and high valuation could keep management conservative in 2025 as well, meaning a lot of the $60 billion may go unspent.\nThe dividend increase probably isn't enough to entice yield-focused investors to Microsoft, but could benefit those who have owned the stock for a long time.\nNewer shareholders have to view Microsoft as a growth stock with a small dividend kicker as a bonus, and hope that AI will turbocharge revenue and earnings in spite of the company's enormous size.\nBut if you're a dividend-focused investor, and would like a material payout within the next few years, it may be better to wait for a pullback in the stock price for a better entry point.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Cramer's Morning Thoughts: 20 Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains that if you're investing with real money, not just playing a simulation like a stock market game, it\u2019s essential to open a real investment account. Reflecting on his own experience from 1979, he recalls that there were no online accounts back then. Since he already had some money in a Mellon Fund account through Fidelity, he decided to open his individual stock account with them as well.\nIn the early days of his investing journey, Cramer admits he didn\u2019t have a clear source for stock ideas, so he turned to Forbes, a magazine he trusted. One article caught his eye about American Agronomics, a promising orange-growing company in Florida. It looked like a good opportunity, so he invested in 10 shares. Unfortunately, disaster struck when a frost destroyed the crops, slashing his investment in half. Cramer likens this experience to the storyline of the movie Trading Places. While the loss was painful, he emphasizes that it didn't crush his determination to keep learning and investing.\n\"At first, I didn\u2019t know where to look for stock ideas, so I turned to a magazine I liked, Forbes. No offense to Forbes, but I read an interesting article about American Agronomics, a compelling orange grower in Florida. It seemed like a solid pick, so I bought 10 shares. Later, a frost hit, wiping out the crops and cutting my investment in half\u2014 a bit like the plot of Trading Places, if you\u2019ve ever seen that classic Eddie Murphy movie. I was devastated but not defeated.\"\nJim Cramer shares a story about one of his early investing experiences. After suffering a loss on his previous investment, he sold off his remaining shares and used the leftover money to buy seven shares of Bobby Brooks, a clothing company recommended by Forbes. Unfortunately, the company reported poor financial results, and Cramer lost even more money. At the time, he had a stable job at American Lawyer magazine, earning $20,000 a year, and was living in a small, affordable studio apartment. This low cost of living allowed him to quickly rebuild his stock portfolio despite his earlier losses.\nDuring his work travels, Cramer once had a great breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and discovered the company was publicly traded. Intrigued, he returned to New York and went to the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, where he studied everything he could find about Bob Evans Farms and compared it with other companies in the same industry. Based on this research, he bought 20 shares of the company. His investment paid off when the stock rose after a strong financial quarter and a stock split. Through this experience, Cramer learned an important lesson: \"Know what you own.\"\n\"During my travels for work, I once had an amazing breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and learned that the company was publicly traded. When I returned to New York, I visited the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, read everything I could about Bob Evans, and compared it with other companies in the industry. Armed with that research, I bought 20 shares. The stock rose immediately following a good quarter and a stock split. That\u2019s when I learned my first key investment lesson: know what you own.\"\nJim Cramer shared that his passion for stocks didn't ignite in adulthood after law school or college, or even in high school. It started much earlier, back in the fourth grade. According to him, his father would bring home the Philadelphia Bulletin, one of the largest newspapers in the country at the time. While most kids would eagerly flip to the comics or sports section, Jim was a huge Phillies fan, he found himself intrigued by something else. Curiosity got the best of him.\nThe business section of the paper, full of lists of names and numbers, looked like an indecipherable code compared to the baseball stats he regularly pored over. Terms like \"open,\" \"range,\" and \"close\" didn't make any sense to him, so he asked his dad, who had some experience dabbling in the stock market.\nHis dad encouraged him, and Jim began tracking stock names he heard on the radio, keeping a record of their daily performance in a ledger. For him, it became a fun game of prediction, much like analyzing baseball stats. He didn\u2019t know much about the companies he was tracking, many were defense stocks that were performing well due to the Vietnam War, but it didn\u2019t matter. The thrill of figuring out the next move kept him hooked.\nNot long after, Jim introduced this \"stock game\" to his fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off his ledger and inviting his classmates to join in the fun. Though not everyone was interested, the lesson was clear: starting early can ignite a lifelong interest. For Cramer, this early exposure to the stock market became the foundation of his love for investing.\n\"Fast forward a bit, and I introduced this \"stock game\" to my fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off my ledger and challenging my classmates to play. Not everyone was into it, but the lesson here is clear: get them started early. That\u2019s how I fell in love with the stock market.\"\nJim Cramer's takeaway from his childhood stock obsession is simple: start young. The stock market is a long-term game, and the earlier you get involved, the higher your chances of winning will get.\nOur Methodology\nThis article delves into Jim Cramer\u2019s latest Morning Thoughts posts which list the top stocks Cramer's watching before the markets open. After going through his posts, we sorted the picks from his watchlist by hedge fund sentiment. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

The analysts expressed concerns about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s declining lead in AI technology, which could affect its competitive edge.\n\"There was a rare downgrade of Microsoft as DA Davidson moves to neutral. The analysts warned about a diminishing AI lead for the Club holding.\"\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s positive investment outlook is built on its strong performance in cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and productivity tools, along with continued growth in key business areas. AI integration into products like Azure and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 has been a major revenue driver, with Azure showing impressive 30% year-over-year growth, largely thanks to AI services.\nIn its Q2 2024 earnings report, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered outstanding results, with revenues of $62 billion, an 18% increase from the previous year, and a net income of $21.9 billion, reflecting 33% growth. This growth was primarily driven by the intelligent cloud division, which posted a 20% year-over-year increase due to the rising demand for AI-powered solutions. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s AI innovations, including GitHub Copilot and Microsoft Fabric, boost user productivity by automating complex tasks in applications like Word, Excel, and Teams.\nAdditionally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investments in AI infrastructure, such as the Maia 100 AI Accelerator and new data centers, underline its commitment to staying competitive in the AI space, improving both efficiency and profitability in the long run.

While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.83 on 12th of December. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 0.8%, which is fairly typical for the industry.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Before making this announcement, Microsoft was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 52.2%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\nThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.12, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.32. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Microsoft has been growing its earnings per share at 18% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Microsoft's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\nOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Microsoft is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Microsoft that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Is Microsoft not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

        "Title": "Microsoft's Stock Buyback: History Says This Is the Likely Impact",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) continues to pour money into capital expenditures (capex) to build its cloud computing infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the company has decided it also has money left to return to shareholders.\nThe software leader hiked its quarterly dividend by 10%, taking it to $0.83. That's good for a forward yield of approximately 0.75%, which isn't likely to draw a lot of income-focused investors. The dividend will be payable on Dec. 12 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 21.\nMeanwhile, the company also announced a new $60 billion buyback plan, with no expiration date.\nMicrosoft has not been a big buyer of its stock this year, so investors might be wondering what impact this new repurchase plan could have. Let's see what history has to say.\nThis is the third time since the fall of 2019 that Microsoft has increased or initiated a buyback, with all three announcements coming in September. They have all been in the $40 billion to $60 billion range.\nThe company last adjusted its buyback plan three years ago, with a similar $60 billion repurchase plan. With the stock trading at around $300 at the time, it would drift lower and end 2022 at below $240 a share.\nBefore that, the company bolstered its buyback plan by $40 billion in September of 2019 with the stock trading just under $140. It then repurchased a lot of shares the next couple of quarters. It initially lifted the stock, but with the onset of COVID, by late March of 2020, the stock was back to around the same levels as when the buyback was initiated.\nOverall, history indicates that the buyback will have little impact on Microsoft's stock. While $60 billion sounds like a lot, it represents less than 2% of its shares outstanding and won't move the needle much.\nAt this point, the biggest driver of Microsoft's stock will likely come down to how well it can capture the AI opportunity. The company has been at the forefront of AI since it partnered with and greatly increased its investment in OpenAI last year.\nThus far, the Azure cloud computing business has been a big AI winner, consistently seeing growth of around 30% this year. This is a pay-as-you-go consumption business, and Microsoft has benefited from customers using its services to create their own AI solutions.\nThe GitHub segment, which is a platform for developers to create, store, and share their code, has seen its revenue surge following the introduction of an AI-powered assistant called Copilot that helps developers complete their coding. Last quarter, the company said its GitHub Copilot was behind 40% of the segment's growth.\nThe company is also using AI in its other products, including Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn. While the company saw low double-digit growth in its Productivity segment, it is looking to continue to drive revenue through the recent introduction of improved Copilots for its Microsoft 365 suite of platforms, which include Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Teams, and Outlook.\nThe company currently changes $30 a month per user for its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on, while the standard business subscription cost for Microsoft 365 is $12.50 per user per month, and $22.50 per user per month for its premium business subscription that includes a number of cybersecurity and identity management options.\nThus, you can see the potential revenue opportunity that Copilot offers Microsoft. The company added a number of attractive features that it hopes will draw customers to buy the Copilot add-ons, including being able to code with Python using natural language in Excel and a new collaborative feature called Copilot Pages that lets multiple users and AI work together on a shared platform.\nThus, while history says Microsoft's buyback will have little effect on its stock, history also says the company's ability to innovate and adapt will be a huge long-term positive. And on this front, I expect AI to continue to be a growth driver over the next several years, both with Azure and Copilot.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.\u00a0Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWhile everyone is talking about rate cuts, some analysts are questioning whether it was necessary even to start cutting rates at this time. Latest data released on Tuesday showed retail sales in the US rose while Wall Street analysts were expecting to see a decline. Oksana Aronov, JPMorgan Asset Management head of market strategy for alternative fixed income, said while talking to CNBC that rate cuts are not even warranted as she thinks there are no signs of broader weakening except for the labor market.\nAronov said cutting rates would \u201cloosen\u201d the financial conditions further. The analyst said that about 14 months ago, everyone was looking at the CPI that was clocking in at 3% and expected the metric to fall to 2%. But even after all these months, CPI year over year is at 2.9%. She said that the Fed should move carefully and the 2% inflation target would be \u201celusive\u201d because fiscal spending will continue to rise.\nAI investors are however looking beyond this debate and already positioning to pile into more growth stocks amid the beginning of the rate-cut cycle.\nFor this article, we picked 10 buzzing AI stocks and discussed the latest news around them.\nWith each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPieter Beens / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a latest note that tech stocks tied to AI can move higher amid rate cuts.\n\u201cIn a nutshell we believe the stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025 in our opinion as the Fed and Powell kick off its rate cutting cycle this week, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector,\u201d Ives said. The analyst mentioned MSFT as one of the stocks that can benefit from rate cuts.\nIn a separate note, Ives recently talked about his bullish thesis on MSFT.\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the top stocks Ives believes can benefit from the AI wave.\n\u201cWhile investors may fret about this massive spending wave and frustrated that top-line growth/margins from these investments could take time to materialize, this ultimately speaks to our view this is a 1995 (almost 1996) start of the Internet Moment, and not a 1999 Tech Bubble-like moment despite bears getting louder during some of these head for the elevators tech sell-offs,\u201d Ives added.\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company\u2019s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Microsoft Corp. (MSFT): Among the Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now",
        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\nThe aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.\nThe financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.\nWhile the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.\nStill, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:\n\u201c...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.\u201d\nJust last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.\nHe discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.\nThe S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.\nRecently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.\nAccording to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.\nMethodology\nWe first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024. We then selected 10 stocks from these Fortune 500 companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The firm believes the uptake of Copilots is slightly below expectations for Microsoft and AI buildouts are also a bottleneck. Microsoft changed how revenue is reported to better align it with how the business is managed, but has not provided historical proforma estimates yet, which will make for a messy quarter, Oppenheimer argues.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper.\u00a0Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0David Tepper\u00a0stands out amongst American hedge fund managers for his two recent moves: his bet on Chinese stocks despite their volatility and underperformance and his early arrival at the AI party.\nDavid Tepper\u2019s passion for investing goes all the way back to his high-school days. He once recalled:\n\u201cI remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.\u201d\nTepper bought his first stock when he was in high school \u2014 100 shares of a $2 stock, \u201cbut then the whole thing went bankrupt,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was a bad investment, but that didn\u2019t deter me.\u201d\nToday, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn\u2019t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper\u2019s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he\u2019d joined in 1985.\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987.\nAccording to\u00a0The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World\u2019s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\u201cGoing into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short\u2014I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cIt was very cool.\u201d Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn\u2019t do as well. \u201cI still got a raise but not as much as I should have.\u201d\nTepper\u2019s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it\u2019s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire\u2019s portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNorthfoto / Shutterstock.com\nBillionaire David Tepper\u2019s Stake: $528,007,064\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company\u2019s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and will bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses, both large and small, navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all scales. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of innovative, AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low-double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Microsoft Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Many Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nNotably, that recent sale by President & Vice Chairman Bradford Smith was not the only time they sold Microsoft shares this year. They previously made an even bigger sale of -US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$412 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$431, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.7% of Bradford Smith's holding.\nInsiders in Microsoft didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Microsoft. Specifically, insiders ditched US$46m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, currently worth about US$1.1b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Microsoft makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Microsoft and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks.\nOn September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.\nAccording to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.\nHe believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.\nAs the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.\nMiller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.\nMiller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.\nNow that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that develops productivity and business suite applications, cloud products, and personal computing products.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue worth $64.7 billion in FQ4 2024, up by 15% year-over-year. During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21%. Its productivity/business processes and intelligent cloud segment, on the other hand, logged revenue worth $20.3 billion and $28.5 billion respectively.\nThe company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. In July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies partnered to enhance and modernize Lumen\u2019s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy its suite of products in Microsoft Azure.\nThe company\u2019s partnerships do not end here. BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX recently made a $100 billion deal to enhance the functioning of data centers and AI. The company is also expanding its footprint by establishing engineering development centers in Abu Dhabi, UAE.\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) financial strength coupled with its strategic partnerships make it one of the best stocks to buy for the long term. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. As of June 30, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the most dominant shareholder in the company and has a position worth $15.6 billion, according to the Insider Monkey database.\nFred Alger Management's Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\"\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Set for a Comeback After Recent Stock Declines?",
        "Author": "  Debasis Saha ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks For Beginners With Little Money. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks for beginners with little money.\n\u201cIn my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,\u201d believes Warren Buffett of\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway, who is the most successful investor not only in our time but also in human history. Buffett made the remarks at his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 2020 Annual Meeting, but it wasn\u2019t the first time he shared similar thoughts. While most investment advisors and internet stock analysts are likely to boast about \u2018chasing the alpha,\u2019 for the Oracle of Omaha, who is currently worth $144.5 billion\u00a0excluding\u00a0his charitable donations over the years, most people are better off tracking the S&P.\nBuffett has, in fact, held this opinion for years. Speaking to CNBC in 2017, he\u00a0reiterated\u00a0that \u201cconsistently\u201d buying an index fund linked to the flagship S&P index is \u201cthe thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time.\u201d Buffett added that an investor should persist even during the bad times, when the \u201ctemptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, well, maybe I should skip a year or something.\u201d Do not give in, says the Oracle, and \u201cjust keep buying\u201d since \u201cAmerican business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.\u201d\nYet, there\u2019s another temptation that especially beginners to the stock market have to face. This is the rush to \u2018alpha\u2019 and by extension, wealth and riches. But according to Buffett, the \u201ctrick is not to pick the right company, the trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low cost way,\u201d since \u201cyou do not want to ever get the impression that you can pick stocks.\u201d This false belief carries the risk of making a beginner believe that they have an edge over others, while the reality \u201cjust doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d believes Buffett.\nHowever, just because you\u2019re a beginner with little money, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make it big. Wall Street, despite its flaws, has also produced titans of the investing world who started out with little to nothing. One of the best examples of this fact is Ken Fisher of\u00a0Fisher Investments. Fisher\u2019s childhood didn\u2019t make him a stranger to Wall Street as his father Philip Fisher is one of the most consequential figures in Wall Street\u2019s history. Fisher Sr. was the original Cathie Wood who popularized growth investing and sought to invest through a strategy called \u201cscuttlebutt investing.\u201d\nFisher Sr. covered this strategy in his seminal work Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits (\u201cone of the great books on investing,\u201d as per Buffett) and shared that an investor should conduct in depth research for a firm by getting to know its executives and employees. While Fisher\u2019s father is a Wall Street legend, Ken started out his firm with just $250 in 1979. As of Q2 2024, the firm had $229 billion in investments as indicated through its SEC filings while Fisher\u2019s net worth is $11.2 billion.\nWhile today\u2019s $250 is far from being similar in value to $250 when Fisher started his investing journey, technology enables today\u2019s beginner investors to invest with even less money. One way to do so, if you\u2019re feeling bold enough to ignore Buffett\u2019s advice against stock picking, is to use fractional shares. Through these, a wide variety of brokerages enable beginners on the stock market to invest in stocks through as little as $1 and any dollar amount via features such as cash quantity stock orders. Fractional investing also enables some of the smallest investors to gain exposure to big ticket stocks, including Berkshire, whose Class B shares have a recent closing share price of $689,287.\nFinally, before we get to our list of the best stocks to buy for beginners with little money, another way for a beginner to start out with little money and grow portfolio value over time comes through\u00a0dividend stocks. These stocks offer beginner investors stable and often regular payouts over the long term. While everyone likes stable income, the true magic of these stocks is the ability to reinvest these dividends to generate even more returns. The benefits of reinvesting dividends are clear when we look at the data. This shows that a $1,000 investment in the benchmark S&P index would be worth $33,500 in 2022 without dividend reinvestment. But if the dividends were reinvestment, the final value nearly triple and would be worth $93,000.\nWith these details in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best stocks to buy for beginners with little money. If you want to learn about a special stock that might be able to deliver 100x returns, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best stocks to buy for beginners with little money, we first made a list of 20 stocks recommended by the financial media. Then, these were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q2 2024 and the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world and a leader in the enterprise computing space. It has exposure to the voluminous personal computing industry via the Windows platform and enterprise computing through Azure. A software focused business model has also allowed Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to become one of the top global players in artificial intelligence. So much so that since the public reveal of ChatGPT in November 2022, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has invested billions into OpenAI, has seen its stock soar by 83% to its peak in July 2024. However, since AI, and particularly the ability to profit from it through enterprise sales, is now baked into Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, any weakness in lower market AI adoption or AI monetization will not bode well for the shares. This has been the case since July, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s shares are down by 14% as the market waits to decide on the macroeconomic outlook and the potential for further AI growth.\nBaron Funds mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Oice products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Oice 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over- quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year- over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best- positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the top stocks for beginners on a budget. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers ",
        "Text": "AI is a notorious liar, but Microsoft now says it has a fix for that. Understandably, that's going to raise some eyebrows -- and there's reason to be skeptical.\nMicrosoft today revealed Correction, a service that attempts to automatically revise AI-generated text that's factually wrong. Correction first flags text that may be erroneous \u2014 say, a summary of a company's quarterly earnings call that possibly has misattributed quotes \u2014 then fact-checks it by comparing the text with a source of truth (e.g. uploaded transcripts).\nCorrection, available as part of Microsoft's Azure AI Content Safety API (in preview for now), can be used with any text-generating AI model, including Meta's Llama and OpenAI's GPT-4o.\n\"Correction is powered by a new process of utilizing small language models and large language models to align outputs with grounding documents,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch. \"We hope this new feature supports builders and users of generative AI in fields such as medicine, where application developers determine the accuracy of responses to be of significant importance.\"\nGoogle introduced a similar feature this summer in Vertex AI, its AI development platform, to let customers \"ground\" models by using data from third-party providers, their own datasets, or Google Search.\nBut experts caution that these grounding approaches don't address the root cause of hallucinations.\n\"Trying to eliminate hallucinations from generative AI is like trying to eliminate hydrogen from water,\" said Os Keyes, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington who studies the ethical impact of emerging tech. \"It's an essential component of how the technology works.\"\nText-generating models hallucinate because they don\u2019t actually \"know\" anything. They're statistical systems that identify patterns in a series of words and predict which words come next based on the countless examples they are trained on.\nIt follows that a model's responses aren't answers, but merely predictions of how a question would be answered were it present in the training set. As a consequence, models tend to play fast and loose with the truth. One study found that OpenAI's ChatGPT gets medical questions wrong half the time.\nMicrosoft's solution is a pair of cross-referencing, copy-editor-esque meta models designed to highlight and rewrite hallucinations.\nA classifier model looks for possibly incorrect, fabricated, or irrelevant snippets of AI-generated text (hallucinations). If it detects hallucinations, the classifier ropes in a second model, a language model, that tries to correct for the hallucinations in accordance with specified \"grounding documents.\"\n\"Correction can significantly enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content by helping application developers reduce user dissatisfaction and potential reputational risks,\" the Microsoft spokesperson said. \"It is important to note that groundedness detection does not solve for 'accuracy,' but helps to align generative AI outputs with grounding documents.\"\nKeyes has doubts about this.\n\"It might reduce some problems,\" they said, \"But it's also going to generate new ones. After all, Correction's hallucination detection library is also presumably capable of hallucinating.\"\nAsked for a backgrounder on the Correction models, the spokesperson pointed to a recent paper from a Microsoft research team describing the models' pre-production architectures. But the paper omits key details, like which datasets were used to train the models.\nMike Cook, a research fellow at Queen Mary University specializing in AI, argued that even if Correction works as advertised, it threatens to compound the trust and explainability issues around AI. The service might catch some errors, but it could also lull users into a false sense of security \u2014 into thinking models are being truthful more often than is actually the case.\n\"Microsoft, like OpenAI and Google, have created this issue where models are being relied upon in scenarios where they are frequently wrong,\" he said. \"What Microsoft is doing now is repeating the mistake at a higher level. Let's say this takes us from 90% safety to 99% safety \u2014 the issue was never really in that 9%. It's always going to be in the 1% of mistakes we're not yet detecting.\"\nCook added that there's also a cynical business angle to how Microsoft is bundling Correction. The feature is free on its own, but the \"groundedness detection\" required to detect hallucinations for Correction to revise is only free up to 5,000 \"text records\" per month. It costs 38 cents per 1,000 text records after that.\nMicrosoft is certainly under pressure to prove to customers \u2014 and shareholders \u2014 that its AI is worth the investment.\nIn Q2 alone, the tech giant ploughed nearly $19 billion in capital expenditures and equipment mostly related to AI. But the company has yet to see significant revenue from AI. A Wall Street analyst this week downgraded the company's stock, citing doubts about its long-term AI strategy.\nAccording to a piece in The Information, many early adopters have paused deployments of Microsoft's flagship generative AI platform, Microsoft 365 Copilot, due to performance and cost concerns. For one client using Copilot for Microsoft Teams meetings, the AI reportedly invented attendees and implied that calls were about subjects that were never actually discussed.\nAccuracy and the potential for hallucinations are now among businesses' biggest concerns when piloting AI tools, according to a KPMG poll.\n\"If this were a normal product lifecycle, generative AI would still be in academic R&D, and being worked on to improve it and understand its strengths and weaknesses,\" Cook said. \"Instead, we've deployed it into a dozen industries. Microsoft and others have loaded everyone onto their exciting new rocket ship, and are deciding to build the landing gear and the parachutes while on the way to their destination.\"\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/microsoft-claims-its-new-tool-can-correct-ai-hallucinations-but-experts-caution-it-has-shortcomings/\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed\u2019s ability to adjust rates.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Latest reports indicate that OpenAI, the generative artificial intelligence startup backed by Microsoft,\u00a0 has crossed the 1 million paid users barrier in the ChatGPT for business section. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 to kickstart the AI boom. The tech giant has invested more than $10 billion in the AI startup already, and is potentially considering another large investment, along with Apple and NVIDIA, as the valuation of the startup touches close to $100 billion. OpenAI is considering higher-priced subscriptions to ChatGPT, perhaps $2,000 per month, as it launches new models like Strawberry and Orion.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was recently added to the Signature Picks list of investment advisory Wells Fargo. The advisory has an Overweight rating on the shares with a $515 price target. In an investor note, the advisory detailed that Microsoft was a leader and share gainer in cloud infrastructure and was positioned to benefit from a significant artificial intelligence-enabled product cycle forming. It added that there was a favorable setup ahead for the tech giant, as incremental server supply coming online would drive an Azure growth reacceleration in the second half of 2024.\nOverall MSFT ranks 4th on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

Launched last year, Copilot is meant to help companies boost productivity by responding to employee prompts and helping them with daily tasks like scheduling meetings, writing up product announcements, and creating presentations.\nIn response to Benioff\u2019s comments, Jared Spataro, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for AI at work, said in a statement to Fortune that the company was \"hearing something quite different\u201d from its customers.\n\u201cWhen I talk to CIOs directly and if you look at recent third-party data, organizations are betting on Microsoft for their AI transformation,\u201d he said.\nThe company\u2019s Copilot customers also shot up 60% last quarter, and daily users have more than doubled, Spataro added.\nBenioff\u2019s comments come as he prepares to show off Salesforce\u2019s new AI platform, dubbed Agentforce, at the company\u2019s annual Dreamforce meeting next month. The platform will be targeted at sales and customer service at first and will launch publicly in October.\nMeanwhile, Agentforce is already being used by some of Salesforce\u2019s biggest customers including payroll and HR software company ADP, restaurant reservation platform OpenTable, and the Wyndham hotel chain, Benioff told CNBC. He added that its Agentforce AI agents were resolving more than 90% of ADP\u2019s customer service inquiries.\nOn the earnings call, Benioff predicted Agentforce AI agents are going to be a breakthrough for its customers.\n\u201cWith our new Agentforce platform, we're going to make a quantum leap for AI,\u201d he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been one of the top stocks on the market in the past decade. Buying and holding shares of this technology giant over this period has helped investors enjoy market-beating returns.\nMore specifically, Microsoft stock has delivered an annual return of almost 27% in the past 10 years, assuming the dividends paid out by the company were reinvested. For comparison, the S&P 500 index's annual returns over the past decade stand at 13% (assuming the dividends were reinvested). So, if you purchased $10,000 worth of Microsoft stock a decade ago, your investment would now be worth $107,950.\nMicrosoft has turned out to be an ideal investment for those looking to construct a million-dollar portfolio in the past decade. Assuming you invested a larger amount -- say $100,000 -- into the stock 10 years ago, you would be a millionaire right now by buying Microsoft alone.\nBut, as they say, past performance is no guarantee of future earnings. Can Microsoft sustain its impressive momentum over the next decade as well and contribute to a diversified million-dollar portfolio?\nMicrosoft released its results for fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 30) at the end of July. The company finished the fiscal year with revenue of $245 billion, an increase of 16% from fiscal 2023. Microsoft's net income stood at $88 billion, increasing 20% on a non-GAAP basis.\nFor comparison, Microsoft's revenue in fiscal 2014 stood at $86.6 billion, while its net income at that time was $22 billion. So, the tech giant's revenue has nearly tripled in the past decade, while its net income has quadrupled. More specifically, Microsoft's top line has clocked a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 11% in the past decade. The company's earnings have clocked a faster CAGR of 15% during this period.\nMicrosoft is a much bigger company than it was a decade ago. It now has a market cap of $3.2 trillion, which makes it the second-largest company in the world. So, expecting Microsoft stock to grow at least tenfold over the next decade would seem a tad far-fetched considering the global economy itself was worth an estimated $105 trillion last year.\nMicrosoft's valuation indicates that it contributes less than 3% to the global economy. So, if Microsoft becomes a $30 trillion-plus company, the global economy will have to grow at a significantly faster pace in the next 10 years, or else Microsoft will end up controlling a massive chunk of the world's gross domestic product (GDP). The bigger a company gets, the harder it gets to maintain the pace of growth.\nAnd yet, Microsoft's growth in the previous fiscal year was higher than the average growth rate it has clocked in the past decade. Even better, the company's top-line growth is projected to remain robust over the next three fiscal years as well, with the following chart indicating analysts are expecting an acceleration in its growth.\nA similar trend is expected as far as the company's bottom line is concerned.\nThe reason analysts expect Microsoft's growth profile to improve is that it is sitting on a much bigger addressable market than it was a decade ago. The company's cloud business was in its infancy at that time, with Microsoft pointing out that its commercial cloud revenue hit an annualized revenue run rate of $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.\nMicrosoft's business was dependent on sales of consumer devices such as the Xbox gaming console and Surface tablets, while the tech giant was also trying its hand at the smartphone business following the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services business. Of course, Microsoft's Windows business was also a significant contributor to its revenue.\nA closer look at Microsoft's business segments now will show the company benefits from several lucrative growth opportunities. For instance, the cloud computing industry is expected to generate a whopping $2 trillion in annual revenue in 2030, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, driven by the growing adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe investment bank points out that the cloud computing market clocked a CAGR of 26% between 2019 and 2023 to $496 billion. So, the size of this market is set to quadruple by the end of the decade, putting Microsoft in a position to sustain solid levels of growth. That's because Microsoft is the second-largest player in the cloud infrastructure market with a market share of 20% (note too that its share increased by 2 percentage points year over year in calendar Q2).\nMicrosoft generated $105 billion in revenue from its cloud business in fiscal 2024, accounting for 43% of its top line. So, if the company manages to hold on to its 20% share of this market in 2030, its cloud revenue could hit $400 billion, or even more if it manages to grab a bigger share of this space.\nThrow in other catalysts such as the booming market for cloud-based office productivity software that Microsoft is targeting with the help of AI-focused tools, and it is easy to see that the company has a bright future. More specifically, the cloud-based office productivity software market is expected to generate $128 billion in revenue in 2030, growing at an annual pace of 28%.\nThese huge end markets are the reasons why Microsoft could exceed the $500 billion revenue target that CEO Satya Nadella has set for the company for fiscal 2030. Assuming Microsoft does hit even $500 billion in revenue in fiscal 2030 and trades at 11.2 times sales at that time (in line with its five-year average price-to-sales ratio), its market cap could jump to $5.6 trillion.\nThat would be a 75% improvement from current levels, but don't be surprised to see this tech stock delivering stronger gains as it seems capable of clocking faster growth.\nSo, Microsoft seems well-placed to deliver substantial gains to investors through the end of the decade. It is worth noting that Microsoft has just increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.83 per share, translating into a forward dividend yield of 0.76%.\nInvestors looking to construct a million-dollar portfolio right now can consider putting $10,000 in investible cash (after paying their bills, clearing high-interest debt, and saving enough for a rainy day) into Microsoft stock as it seems built for more upside in the long run. It may not make you a millionaire all on its own over the next decade, but it will contribute its fair share toward attaining that goal.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

The tech sector giant's share price improved by more than 2% across the trading session thanks to that news, which came from a private company in which it's heavily invested. By comparison, the S&P 500 index could only manage a 0.5% increase on the day.\nOn Tuesday, tech industry website The Information, citing two unidentified people who have tested the goods, reported that OpenAI aims to release its latest product within the next two weeks. That product, called Strawberry, is a reasoning-focused set of artificial intelligence (AI) functionalities developed by the high-profile specialist in the technology.\nOpenAI is the developer of ChatGPT, the very high-profile AI program that is something of an early flagship for the tech. Microsoft has committed to invest a reported $13 billion in the still privately held business; with that, it is essentially considered by many to be something of a benefactor for OpenAI. Microsoft has ambitious plans to integrate AI functionalities and services into most of its software products.\nNeither Microsoft nor OpenAI has yet commented on the report, which was widely disseminated throughout tech media after publication.\nBoth OpenAI and Microsoft are impatient and vastly ambitious, so The Information's report is entirely plausible. If proven accurate, it will surely be a plus for Microsoft, placing it on the cutting edge of an advanced technology.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other big company stocks.\nMega-cap stocks\u2014major technology companies to be precise\u2014continued to drive a disproportionate share of the total US stock market returns. Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500\u2019s 40%+ gain.\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies\u2019 stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks. \u00a0Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\nOur methodology \nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the big and well-established companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) develops and licenses consumer and enterprise software. The company is known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite.\nGiven its investment in OpenAI, Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as a leader in AI. The company continues to upsell users on premium-priced Office 365 versions to include advanced telephony features. The company transitioned to a\u00a0subscription model for its Microsoft 365 software. Therefore, if anyone wants to use its suite of apps \u2013 such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel \u2013 they will be tied in its ecosystem for several years.\nMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s cloud business is the largest and fastest-growing segment, and this business is well-placed to drive total growth as AI capacity comes online.\nCost-cutting initiatives in corporate America have also been implemented. This means that cost optimization headwinds, which were impacting Azure\u2019s growth, are now over. Separately, its new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, is being employed by ~60% of Fortune 500 companies. Therefore, it should be able to hold a leading position in AI.\nMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) has announced results for 4Q 2024, with revenue reaching $64.7 billion, up by 15% (and up 16% in constant currency) and operating income coming at $27.9 billion (up 16% in constant currency). The company\u2019s quarterly results were aided by revenue increases across Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.\nAnalysts at Truist Financial reaffirmed a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares of Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), giving the company a price target of $600.00 on 17th June. According to our database, 279 hedge funds held stakes in the company in the second quarter, with positions worth $89.06 billion.\nFred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best big company stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there\u2019s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he\u2019s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it\u2019s worth paying attention to what\u2019s going right.\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I\u2019m willing to declare that there\u2019s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I\u2019m not trying to call a bottom, let\u2019s make that crystal clear, but I think it\u2019s worth taking a hard look at what\u2019s actually going right\u2014not just what\u2019s going wrong.\"\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it\u2019s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn\u2019t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\"Sure, the market\u2019s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren\u2019t even oversold yet\u2014at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there\u2019s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don\u2019t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let\u2019s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That\u2019s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won\u2019t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it\u2019s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\"But let\u2019s be realistic: You can\u2019t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there\u2019s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates when business is booming. That\u2019s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday\u2019s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\"\nOur Methodology\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

He pointed out that history often shows large market drops can turn into great buying opportunities. As an example, Cramer highlighted Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which lost $178 billion in market value on March 16, 2020, but later surged by 202%, far outpacing the S&P 500's 131% gain over the same period. This demonstrates how significant downturns can set the stage for strong recoveries.\n\"Microsoft lost $178 billion in market cap on March 16th, 2020, but went on to surge 202%, compared to a 131% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period.\"\nIn Q2 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) showed strong financial performance with $60.8 billion in revenue, an 11% increase from the previous year, driven mainly by its cloud and AI businesses. Azure, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud platform, saw a 29% rise in revenue, reinforcing its leading position in the cloud market. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s net income grew to $21.5 billion, up 15% from last year, and earnings per share reached $2.85, surpassing analyst predictions.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) introduced new AI features in August 2024 for Azure and Microsoft 365, such as tools for automating report summaries and drafting emails, which are expected to enhance productivity and attract more users. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s collaboration with OpenAI, known for its ChatGPT technology, strengthens its AI capabilities.\nAdditionally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s gaming division benefits from the successful acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc.\n(NASDAQ:ATVI) and the expansion of Xbox Game Pass, positioning it well in the growing gaming sector. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s strong earnings, advances in cloud and AI technology, and strategic moves in gaming make it well-positioned for future success.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Institutions' substantial holdings in Microsoft implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\nThe top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company\n Insiders have been selling lately \nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nMicrosoft already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Microsoft's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Microsoft. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.1b worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. \nWith a 27% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Microsoft. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Microsoft has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Google escalated a feud with Microsoft over cloud computing on Wednesday with a European Union antitrust complaint accusing its tech rival of anticompetitive practices.\nIn a blog post, Google alleged that Microsoft's licensing practices lock business customers into using its Azure cloud computing platform.\nIt said Microsoft is the only cloud provider that uses such tactics, which stifles competition, costs businesses more and exposes them to bigger security risks.\nGoogle, which competes against Microsoft with its Google Cloud services, said it filed a formal complaint with the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer.\nMicrosoft said that it already amicably settled similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, \u201ceven after Google hoped they would keep litigating.\u201d\nThose providers, part of the trade group Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe, said in July that they withdrew their own complaint after signing a deal with Microsoft.\n\"Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission,\u201d Microsoft said in a prepared statement.\nA commission spokesperson said it has received the complaint and will assess it \u201cunder our standard procedures.\u201d\nGoogle said Microsoft changed its licensing terms in 2019 to impose \u201cextreme financial penalties\u201d on businesses that want to use Windows Server software on rival services like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. That's despite there being no technical barriers to switch services.\nLocking in users to a single technology platform brings heightened security risks, Google said, pointing to a global tech outage in July stemming from a faulty software update by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike that grounded flights and knocked banks and hospital systems offline.\n"

        "Author": "  Orianna Rosa Royle ",
        "Text": "In today's leadership landscape, soft skills are undeniably en vogue. However, don't be quick to lump empathy in with the rest. That\u2019s because Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella firmly believes that the art of comprehending others transcends the soft skills category. In his view, characterizing it as \"soft\" understates its significance, as he asserts that mastering empathy is, in fact, the most formidable skill of them all.\n\"Empathy is not a soft skill,\" Nadella said in an interview with Axel Springer\u2019s CEO Mathias D\u00f6pfner. \"In fact, it's the hardest skill we learn\u2014to relate to the world, to relate to people that matter the most to us.\"\nNot only does being empathetic enable leaders to better connect with their staff, but according to Nadella, customers too.\nRead more: Satya Nadella returned Microsoft to the top by showing humility as CEO. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s done\n\u201cIn fact, innovation is about meeting the unmet, unarticulated needs of customers,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat\u2019s the source of that? Some would say design thinking. But design thinking is empathy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Indian-American chief who took Microsft\u2019s helm in 2014 has hailed the power of empathy at work.\n\"If you have empathy for your people, they will do their best work and you'll make progress,\" Nadella once said on an episode of LinkedIn's \"Hello Monday\" podcast.\nHe\u2019s also previously spoken out about how becoming a parent to his late disabled son Zain\u2014who passed away in February 2022 at the age of 26\u2014shaped him into a more empathic leader.\n\u201cAs [Zain\u2019s] parents, it was up to us not to question \u2018why,\u2019 but instead to do everything we could to improve his life,\u201d Nadella wrote in a LinkedIn post in 2017, where he credited his wife\u2019s empathy with inspiring his own.\n\u201cFrom her I have learned that when I infuse empathy into my everyday actions, it is powerful, whether they be in my role as a father or as a CEO.\u201d\n\u201cBecoming a father of a son with special needs\u2026has shaped my personal passion for and philosophy of connecting new ideas to empathy for others,\u201d Nadella wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cAnd it is why I am deeply committed to pushing the bounds on what love and compassion combined with human ingenuity and passion to have impact can accomplish with my colleagues at Microsoft.\u201d\nAs well as the profound impact that raising a child with quadriplegic and cerebral palsy had, Nadella also revealed that playing cricket growing up shaped how he leads today.\n\u201cTeam sports have a huge bearing on who we become as citizens and leaders,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCricket is a symphony, and every player is a note in that composition. Leadership in cricket is about being a guiding light and source of inspiration,\u201d fellow panelist and former cricketer Zaheer Khan agreed.\n\u201cIn cricket, we lead not with arrogance but with humility,\u201d Khan added before turning his attention to Nadella\u2019s success as a CEO. \u201cIn the journey of Satya Nadella, we see a reflection of these principles in the corporate world.\u201d\nRecent research has echoed that sports can be attributed to helping people bank the soft skills needed to lead. It's why athletic students are significantly more likely to gain an MBA, land senior job rankings, and earn more money than their non-athletic counterparts.\nUltimately, communicating, teamwork, and leadership are desirable traits both on the pitch and in the boardroom.\nBeing vulnerable hasn\u2019t always been an asset in the workplace, but during the pandemic employees (who were struggling from isolation, burdened with increased household responsibilities, and more) needed leaders who could listen, build a sense of team community, and help fit work around their problems.\nUnlike technical skills, soft skills determine how you interact with your team. Emotional intelligence, effective communication, and being able to influence and motivate are all a part of the repertoire.\nAccording to LinkedIn\u2019s research of nearly 23,000 workers worldwide, more than three in five (61%) workers say soft skills in the workplace are just as important as hard skills.\nWhat\u2019s more, when it comes specifically to empathy, almost 90% of U.S. workers surveyed in Ernst & Young\u2019s 2021 report said that having an empathetic manager increases their job satisfaction, productivity, and cultivated loyalty.\nMeanwhile, over half said that they had left a job because their boss wasn't empathetic enough about issues at work or in their personal life.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "ANSYS Inc ANSS, TSMC and Microsoft MSFT have successfully tested a solution that enhances the simulation and analysis process of silicon Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs). The joined forces have yielded a 10X speed-up in Ansys\u2019 Lumerical FDTD photonic simulations using Microsoft Azure\u2019s NC A100v4-series virtual machines powered by NVIDIA accelerated computing technology operating on Azure AI infrastructure.\u00a0Silicon PICs (category of optical communications) are a critical component of hyperscale data centers and Internet-of-Things applications, where vast amounts of data must be transferred at high speeds across long distances.\u00a0 Applications of silicon PICs span industries, including data communications, biomedical tools, automotive LiDAR systems and artificial intelligence.\u00a0However, the design and fabrication of PICs pose unique challenges, particularly when it comes to combining photonic circuits with electronic circuits. Any design flaw can lead to discontinuity within the chips, resulting in costly delays that could stretch to several months.\nTo overcome the challenges associated with the design and optimization of silicon PICs, Ansys, TSMC and Microsoft executed a pilot project to accelerate the simulation process using cloud infrastructure. The enhanced speed and efficiency of Lumerical FDTD simulations in the cloud have a direct impact on the ability to unlock the ultra-bandwidth capabilities of silicon PICs. By deploying Lumerical FDTD on Azure NC A100v4-series virtual machines, which utilize NVIDIA's cutting-edge GPUs, the experiment achieved remarkable results.\u00a0The Azure NC A100v4-series VMs provided highly efficient and scalable performance. This not only reduced the time required for simulations but also optimized the use of resources, effectively balancing cost with performance. Moreover, Azure Virtual Desktop ensured a smooth transition to the cloud by maintaining the same user experience as on the desktop, allowing designers to continue using familiar tools and interfaces while benefiting from the scalability and power of the cloud.The partnership between Ansys, TSMC and Microsoft showcases the potential of combining advanced simulation tools with the power of cloud computing, setting a new standard for innovation in the semiconductor and photonics industries.\nAnsys continues to hold a strong foothold in the high-end design simulation software market through strategic partnerships that expand its product line and cushion the top-line performance. In July 2024, ANSS extended collaboration with NVIDIA and Supermicro to offer Turnkey hardware solutions that substantially boost Ansys Multiphysics simulation capabilities.\u00a0The company\u2019s robust product portfolio and cross-domain offering will continue to increase customer engagement. As of June 30, 2024, total deferred revenues and backlog came in at $1.394 billion, up 7.6% year over year.\u00a0Additionally, the company is gaining momentum across most of the sectors. In the last reported quarter, ANSS\u2019 revenues climbed 20% year over year to $594.1 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9%. The upside was driven by two major multi-year contracts worth $210 million in the automotive and high-tech industries during the quarter in the Americas region.\u00a0Ansys has not issued an outlook, given the pending acquisition by Synopsys (announced in January 2024). The transaction has been approved by Ansys shareholders.\nANSS currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have gained 9.9% in the past year compared with the sub-industry\u2019s growth of 35.3%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader technology space are Harmonic Inc.

        "Title": "Microsoft deal propels Three Mile Island restart, with key permits still needed",
        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Refiles to fix typo in 'companies' in paragraph three)\n(Reuters) -Constellation Energy and Microsoft have signed a power deal to help resurrect a unit of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in what would be the first-ever restart of its kind, the companies said on Friday.\nKey regulatory permits for the plant's new life, however, haven't been filed, regulators say.\nBig tech has led to a sudden surge in U.S. electricity demand for data centers needed to expand technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Nuclear energy, which is nearly carbon-free and broadly considered more reliable than energy sources like solar and wind, has become a popular option for technology companies with uninterrupted power needs and climate pledges.\n\"Nuclear plants are the only energy sources that can consistently deliver on that promise,\" Constellation Chief Executive Officer Joe Dominguez said in a statement.\nConstellation's shares were up more than 20% by early afternoon to $251.42 and have risen more than 100% so far this year.\nPower from the plant would be used to offset Microsoft's data center electricity use, the companies said.\nA relaunch of Three Mile Island, which had a separate unit suffer a partial-meltdown in 1979 in one of the biggest industrial accidents in the country's history, still requires federal, state and local approvals.\nConstellation has yet to file an application with federal nuclear regulators to restart the plant.\n\"It\u2019s up to Constellation to lay out its rationale for justifying restart, so we\u2019re prepared to engage with the company on next steps,\" said Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) spokesperson Scott Burnell.\nConstellation said it expected the NRC review process to be completed in 2027.\nBILLION DOLLAR BET\nThe deal would help enable a revival of Unit 1 of the five-decades-old facility in Pennsylvania that was retired in 2019 due to economic reasons. Unit 2, which had the meltdown, will not be restarted.\nConstellation plans to spend about $1.6 billion to revive the plant, which it expects to come online by 2028.\nReuters first reported on the potential restart in July.\nSources told Reuters at the time that Constellation hoped it would receive federal support for Three Mile Island that was similar to what was given to the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station, which received a $1.5 billion conditional loan for a relaunch from the Biden administration.\nUnder the Constellation-Microsoft deal, Microsoft will purchase energy from the restarted plant for a period of 20 years. The Three Mile Island unit will provide 835 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power about 700,000 homes.\nA restart is expected to be challenging, but as power demand spikes, the virtually carbon-free electricity source is seeing renewed support from tech companies.\n\"This agreement is a major milestone in Microsoft's efforts to help decarbonize the grid in support of our commitment to become carbon negative,\" Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy at Microsoft, said in a statement.\nMicrosoft has also signed a power purchase agreement with Washington-state fusion company Helion, which says the plant will be online by 2028, far earlier than many scientists say fusion will become commercial.\nMajor tech executives, including ChatGPT developer OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, have touted nuclear energy as a solution to the growing power needs of data centers.\nAltman has backed and is the chairman of nuclear power startup Oklo, which went public through a blank-check merger in May, while TerraPower - a startup Gates co-founded - broke ground on a nuclear facility in June.\nNuclear plants generated about 18.6% of the total electricity in the U.S. last year, according to Energy Information Administration data.\nThe power supply deals with A.I. data centers are also facing increased scrutiny. A similar deal between Talen Energy and Amazon signed earlier this year has been challenged by a group of electric utilities alleging it could spike costs for customers or hamper grid reliability.\nFinancial details of the Microsoft-Constellation deal were not disclosed. The companies declined to give more details on the agreement.\n(Reporting by Laila Kearney in New York, Mrinalika Roy and Sourasis Bose in Bengaluru, and Timothy Gardner in Washington; Editing by Janane Venkatraman, Sriraj Kalluvila and Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Why Are Street Analysts Bullish On This Wide Moat Stock Now?",
        "Author": "  Bob Karr ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other wide moat stocks.\nUndoubtedly, global and domestic investors have mastered the art of riding out the highs and lows of the US stock market. They tend to believe that fluctuations in the stock market are short-term, and should be dealt with accordingly.\nMcKinsey & Company highlighted that, in 2001, the market cap of the companies making up the S&P 500 stood at ~$10 trillion. As of mid-June 2022 (despite the bearish opening), S&P 500 market capitalization touched ~$32 trillion. Also, the mean total yearly returns (including dividends) of the S&P 500 between 1996 to mid-June 2022 was ~9% in nominal terms, or ~6.8% in real terms.\nThe investors have seen significant fluctuations. S&P 500 saw a strong decline in 2000, 2001, and 2002, with a ~37% decline in 2008 and a ~22% fall in 1H 2022. That being said, between 1996 and mid-June 2022, S&P 500 returns only declined 5 times annually. While there can be significant fluctuations in the US markets, the macroeconomic indicators can help provide a broader overview of the expected performance of equities.\nThe decision on the rate cut by the US Federal Reserve was indeed a closely watched one. The apex bank decided to go for a larger 50-bps reduction in interest rates, instead of a more traditional 25-bps rate cut. This decision was more consequential than normal for 2 reasons. Firstly, this rate cut marked the initiation of a long-awaited easing cycle. Therefore, the US Federal Reserve shifted its focus away from\u00a0the risks related to inflation\u00a0and towards protecting the labor market and economic expansion.\nSecondly, the rate cut decision itself was much more critical and engaging than normal. History suggests that the US Fed provides greater transparency when it comes to decision-making. This means the financial markets are not surprised by the decision as people know what the US Fed is going to do. However, the recent one was not like this, with markets pricing the 25-bps rate cut decision. The move to cut the key rates by 50 basis points should help the US Fed normalize rates more quickly and be ahead of the emergent\u00a0slowness in the broader labor market. That being said, the US Fed's forecasts (the\u00a0dots) don't reflect this pace continuing beyond September.\nThe recent report by Russell Investments highlighted that the company expects the US Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at each of the remaining meetings in 2024. Furthermore, this pace should be sustained into 2025. If the trajectory continues, the US Fed will be down to the company\u2019s expectations of the normal or equilibrium rate of interest of between 3%-3.25% by this time of the next year.\nThe implications for the rate cut onto equities hang mainly on the fundamental backdrop\u2014i.e., corporate earnings and whether the US economy is heading for a soft or hard landing. In case of a soft landing, Russell Investments believes that the combination of lower rates and resilient fundamentals should benefit select areas of the market such as real estate and small caps. Regarding\u00a0small caps, in particular, the investment firm expects a ripe environment for skilled active managers to pick quality businesses at more attractive valuations.\nIn the remainder of 2024 and 2025, the US Fed cuts are expected to have a positive effect on the economy and markets. Analysts at Wells Fargo believe that the global economy should also benefit, as major central banks around the world have already announced the cut rates or will be announcing soon.\nMarket experts believe that the Fed rate cut expectations have led to the investors rejigging their portfolios and pivoting towards public companies that are interest-rate sensitive. These include dividend companies, telecommunication giants, utilities, and REITs, among others.\nWall Street also believes that the rate cuts should help well-established and financially stable companies to increase their spending and investments, which are likely to reflect in their stock prices in the remainder of 2024 and early 2025.\nOur methodology\nTo list the 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted an extensive online search and sifted through online rankings and VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF. Next, we considered average analysts\u2019 price targets of the selected stocks. Finally, we ranked the stocks according to their potential upside, as of September 21. We also included the hedge fund sentiment around these stocks, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nAnalysts\u2019 Average Price Target: 14.30%\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is engaged in developing and supporting software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a wide economic moat, backed by 2 segments specifically: productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud. Experts believe that customers value the company\u2019s products as stand-alone solutions and its immense product breadth. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s applications are tightly integrated, making the products even more sticky and appealing.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has adopted a\u00a0subscription model for its Microsoft 365 software. Therefore, anyone who wants to use the company\u2019s wildly popular suite of apps \u2013 such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel \u2013 will be tied into its ecosystem for several years. Experts opine that the company\u2019s revenues should continue to be supported by repeated customer engagement. This engagement helps generate revenue from the initial sale of services, which then allows Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to upsell and cross-sell other ones too.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has plans to raise its\u00a0capital expenditures, with a majority of this going to the company\u2019s cloud business and towards building its AI infrastructure. The company spent $55.7 billion in FY 2024, which includes ~$19 billion in 4Q 2024.\nFor FY 2025, the company expects continued double-digit growth in revenue and operating income. Regarding gaming, the Activision acquisition continues to support the company\u2019s strategy of delivering content throughout all of its platforms and building a subscription business.\nAnalysts at Tigress Financial upped their price target on the shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) from $475.00 to $550.00, giving it a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on 13th June. Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released a second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 4th on our list of the best wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Chris Morris ",
        "Text": "Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, is opening up once again.\nMicrosoft and Constellation Energy, which owns the plant, have struck a deal that will see the plant\u2019s undamaged reactor resume operations to power Microsoft\u2019s AI data centers. Microsoft has signed a 20-year power-purchase agreement with Constellation, which will spend $1.6 billion to restart the reactor. It\u2019s expected to be operational again by 2028.\nConstellation shares were up 14% in early trading Friday morning.\n\u201cBefore it was prematurely shuttered due to poor economics, this plant was among the safest and most reliable nuclear plants on the grid, and we look forward to bringing it back with a new name and a renewed mission to serve as an economic engine for Pennsylvania,\u201d said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation in a statement.\nRead more: I loved my job at Microsoft, but I had to resign on principle. Here\u2019s why\nThe facility\u2019s Unit 1 reactor will be restarted. That facility sits next to the Unit 2 reactor that had the partial meltdown in 1979. Unit 1 \u201cpermanently shut down\u201d on Sept. 20, 2019 after starting operations in 1974. Constellation purchased the unit in 2000, and it produced enough electricity in the following years to power 800,000 homes for almost two years and \u201coffset more than 95 million metric tons of carbon, the equivalent of nearly 20 million cars off the road,\u201d the company says.\nConstellation was not the owner of the Unit 2 reactor.\nThe owners of approximately one-third of the country\u2019s nuclear power plants are reportedly taking with companies to help power data centers. And a big source of that demand is the growing use of artificial intelligence. That\u2019s raising concerns about the impact on the larger power grid, which has struggled some as the country experiences extreme weather conditions. (The grid is also considered a high-risk target of hackers.)\nExperts have warned data centers could become a big strain on the U.S. power grid, with the nine-year projected growth forecast for North America essentially doubling from where it stood a year ago. Last year, the five-year forecast from Grid Strategies projected growth of 2.6%. That number has since nearly doubled to 4.7%\u2014and planners expect peak demand to grow by 38 gigawatts. In real-world terms, that\u2019s sufficient to power 12.7 million homes.\n\u201cThe U.S. electric grid is not prepared for significant load growth,\u201d Grid Strategies warned.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Fatima Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other big tech stocks.\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of\u00a0 AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a systems software big tech giant. It is based in Redmond, Washington.\nOver the past three years, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has managed to almost triple its valuation - a feat that has landed the company in the $3 trillion club with Apple. The company also showed immense growth to investors in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with revenue and operating income both rising by 15% year-over-year.\nA big reason why Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is on investors' radars right now is its plans to increase capital expenditures in cloud and AI infrastructure. In fiscal 2024, the company has spent $55.7 billion, with $19 billion being spent in the fourth quarter alone. Through this increased spending, investors believe Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure business will be able to stay on par with competitor Amazon Web Services. Azure currently holds 25% of the cloud computing market share, and AI is expected to increase this even further.\nThere were 279 hedge funds long Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $89.1 billion.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Agreement will deliver 25,000 tons of permanent CO2 removal while generating over 5 megawatts (MW) of clean baseload electricity through Arbor\u2019s novel, modular power system\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif., September 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arbor, a carbon-negative power company, today announced an agreement to deliver 25,000 tons of high-quality, permanent carbon dioxide removal to Microsoft. Starting in 2027, Arbor will support Microsoft\u2019s climate goals by delivering 5,000 tons of carbon removal per year while generating 5MW of clean electricity\u2014enough to power roughly 4,000 US homes year-round\u2014using readily available organic waste as a fuel source for its compact, modular system.\n\"This contract with Microsoft serves as a significant endorsement from one of the most influential and trusted leaders in the industry,\" said Brad Hartwig, CEO of Arbor. \"Microsoft\u2019s commitment to draw down their historical emissions by 2050 perfectly aligns with our mission to bring the planet back into balance with carbon-negative electricity and permanent carbon removal. This agreement underlines the promise of our technology and is another critical step in getting this project off the ground. Together, we\u2019re not just powering the future\u2014we are erasing the emissions of the past.\"\nToday\u2019s news follows the recent announcement that Arbor is the first supplier signed on to have credits issued against a new protocol from Isometric for Biogenic Carbon Capture and Sequestration (BCCS), and all carbon removal delivered to Microsoft through this agreement will be registered with Isometric. Isometric is the world\u2019s most rigorous carbon removal registry with a mission to ensure the transition to carbon removal happens responsibly and fast. The scientific rigor and transparency behind Isometric\u2019s CO2 removal verification process further validates the technology behind Arbor.\nThe Arbor system is based on the fundamental principles of Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), but reimagined with novel technology that makes it emissions-free and extremely modular. Arbor's team is leveraging recent advancements in oxy-combustion and supercritical turbomachinery - many of which they pioneered while developing rocket engines over the last decade. When applied to electricity generation, these innovations enable a system that is both cheaper and faster to deploy than a traditional power plant, without compromising on efficiency.\n\"The technical promise and modularity of Arbor\u2019s system makes it a very compelling climate solution,\" said Brian Marrs, Senior Director for Carbon Removal and Energy at Microsoft. \"Arbor has established a clear, actionable blueprint for simultaneously removing CO2 while producing clean electricity. We look forward to collaborating with the Arbor team on our path to carbon-negativity.\"\nArbor\u2019s initial facility, which will supply credits to Microsoft, will be able to sequester and permanently store 75,000 tons of carbon per year\u2013the equivalent of taking 16,000 cars off the road\u2013while generating 5 MW of clean electricity. Once fully scaled in 2030, Arbor will be able to generate 100 MW of electricity while removing almost two-million tons of carbon each year. Being able to rapidly scale to these volumes also enables Arbor to achieve the silver bullet in durable carbon removal: a price well below $100 per ton--while simultaneously solving the fundamental gap in clean energy: baseload power at rates competitive to fossil fuels.\nAbout Arbor\nArbor is a carbon-negative power company founded by SpaceX veterans who turned their focus from exploring space to saving Earth. Its novel power system turns organic waste into a reliable source of clean electricity while extracting pure, storable carbon dioxide at scale. Backed by prominent climate-focused venture capital firms including Gigascale Capital, Voyager Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and Cantos Ventures, Arbor was founded in 2022 and is headquartered in El Segundo, CA.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240918265258/en/\nContacts\nPatrick Mahoneypatrick@pdmstrategies.com\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) look very promising so lets take a look.\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Microsoft is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.28 = US$109b \u00f7 (US$512b - US$125b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThus, Microsoft has an ROCE of 28%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.4% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nIn the above chart we have measured Microsoft's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Microsoft .\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Microsoft. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 28%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 78%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Microsoft thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\nIn summary, it's great to see that Microsoft can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 232% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\nLike most companies, Microsoft does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Google has ramped up a legal squabble with Microsoft Corp. over the lucrative cloud market, accusing the US software giant of abusing its market dominance in a formal complaint to the European Union\u2019s antitrust watchdog.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\nThe Alphabet Inc. unit alleged that Microsoft\u2019s licensing terms for Azure cloud services restricts customers accessing rival platforms, including Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. It said Microsoft\u2019s conduct amounts to an abuse of dominance under EU law, according to a summary of the complaint.\nGoogle also argued that Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the cloud sector risks exposing EU citizens to security risks and IT failures. It highlighted the turmoil that ensued in July when a faulty update by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. crashed millions of Windows computers, crippling airports, banks, stock exchanges and businesses around the world.\nWednesday\u2019s escalation follows an agreement forged between Microsoft and smaller European cloud firms that allowed it to dodge a formal EU probe.

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 279\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $95.3 million\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the mega cap technology giant that is one of the biggest players in the cloud computing industry as well as personal computing. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Windows powers up most of the world's computers, while Azure is believed to control 26% of the global cloud computing market. Like other big tech firms, it has access to its own foundational model, through partner firm OpenAI's ChatGPT. OpenAI's brand status as the firm that popularized AI also allows Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to benefit from the association. This is key to the firm's future especially as it plans to market AI products to enterprise customers through cloud computing. The central tenet of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s hypothesis these days is its ability to monetize AI especially since it has plowed billions of dollars into the technology. In fact, after its Q2 earnings, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s shares tanked by 8% as it revealed that Azure growth had slowed to 29% from an earlier 31%\u2013\u2013which cast doubts on its ability to add tailwinds from AI services.\nThe stock began to recover though as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s shared during the earnings call:\n\u201cFor Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency, or US$28.6 billion to US$28.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per-user business will continue to moderate.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks In Each Sector In 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other top stocks in each sector.\nWith 2024\u2019s close approaching fast, the stock market has touched new records that few would have thought were possible when the Federal Reserve started its interest rate hiking cycle in March 2022. Most of the stock market\u2019s gains are due to artificial intelligence making a splash in November 2022, and since then, investors have had a chance to bask in meteoric returns as they waited for financial conditions to ease.\nFor instance, consider the stock performance of the world\u2019s leading AI GPU designer. From the start of 2021 to the end of 2022, when inflation had peaked in the US, its shares had bled 53%. Back then, the semiconductor industry was facing a historic glut as chip companies had shipped excessive inventory into the channel after witnessing booming demand during the pandemic era. However, since the start of November 2022, the stock has gained 800%+, simply due to the fact that its GPUs are the prized commodity for training and using AI software.\nOn the flip side, consider a warehouse and logistics real estate stock with a market value of $117 billion and which ranked 11th on our list of the 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now. During the time that the GPU designer\u2019s shares gained 800%+, its stock has posted a mere 17% in returns through share price appreciation. This bifurcation sits at the heart of the stock market right now, where while stocks exposed to AI, such as the 4th top stock out of the 12 that Jim Cramer believes investors should watch closely, are up by 61% year to date.\nApart from chip designers, other stocks have also been caught up in the AI wave. One of the biggest sectors that has seen these tailwinds is utilities. Within utilities, firms that rely on carbon free sources to generate electricity are seeing particular interest. One top stock that has performed well this year ranked 2nd on our list of 10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now. A nuclear energy firm that generates 90% of its 32GW energy capacity through nuclear, the stock is up 120% year to date. In fact, this stock jumped by a hefty 26% between September 18th to September 23rd, after Microsoft announced a 20 year deal with it to use a nuclear plant at Three Mile Island to power up its AI data centers. The shares were further helped when the biggest banks in the world backed a COP28 goal to triple global nuclear power generation capacity by 2050.\nFocusing on the broader clean energy sector which has been quite distressed in the era of high rates with the S&P\u2019s clean energy index down by 3.19% over the past year, analysts continue to be bullish about the sector\u2019s future. Estimates from the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggest that global clean energy demand is slated to grow by 3.4% annually until 2026. Within the US, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) expects that renewable energy deployment will grow by 17% in the US this year to potentially account for 25% of American energy production by touching 42GW. Government spending has played a key role in this optimism, as these initiatives have led to private companies announcing $82 billion in investments for clean energy manufacturing and infrastructure.\nWhile clean energy has lagged amidst investor worries of high rates sapping investments, other sectors have prospered. One such sector is the telecommunications sector. As we live in the information age, humanity\u2019s data consumption has touched levels no one would have thought were possible when the internet was growing in popularity during the 1990s. Estimates show that while global data consumption already sat at a remarkable 3.4 million petabytes (PB \u2013 1 PB = 1,048,576 GB), it is expected to grow to 9.7 million PB by 2027. Simultaneously, telecommunications companies are expected to invest a whopping $342 billion in network upgrades by 2027, while the number of Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets is expected to surge to 25.1 billion by the same year. Telecommunications stocks have performed well over the past twelve months as well since the S&P\u2019s telecommunications index is up by 40.48%.\nMid September also saw a status quo change on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points. While this is great for industrial, real estate, and clean energy stocks, it\u2019s also beneficial for financial services firms and banks in particular. While banks have the opportunity to earn more money through interest from loans generated when rates are high, their deposit costs also increase to dent the overall net interest income. As a result, since the Fed\u2019s rate cut announcement, the S&P\u2019s bank stock index has gained 5.8%. As a whole, the financial services industry is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7%, or from $31 trillion in 2023 to $33.5 trillion by the end of this year.\nCrucially, lower rates also mean that alternative securities become more attractive to investors. When it comes to stocks, dividend stocks are particularly favored as their yield becomes lucrative compared to low interest rates. The Dividend Aristocrat Index is up by 2.3% since the rate cut. Investors, it seems, are attracted to dividends again, which is unsurprising considering that the S&P\u2019s dividend stocks paid out $153 billion in dividends in Q2 2024 to mark a 7% annual and 1.2% sequential growth.\nA Nuclear power plant with all its safety & security protocols in place.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best stocks to buy in each sector, we used our coverage of the best stocks in infrastructure, materials, clean energy, telecommunications, financial services, dividends, artificial intelligence, real estate, consumer defensive, and healthcare to pick out the top stocks. The stocks are ranked by the number of hedge funds that bought the shares during Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q2 2024: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest software companies in the world. It operates across two fronts, namely personal computing through Windows and Cloud computing via Azure. This provides Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with the advantages of catering to a high volume market through Windows and a margin heavy, recurring revenue business with Azure. It also means that since roughly 50% of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s revenue as of Q4 FY24 comes from Cloud, growth and cost control coupled with profitability for this business are key drivers of the firm\u2019s hypothesis. On this front, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is aggressively investing billions of dollars in artificial intelligence, and it is one of the few companies in the world to have a foundational AI model courtesy of its partnership with OpenAI. As a result, future share price gains are dependent on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s ability to convince investors that AI investments are leading to cloud computing profits.\nBaron Funds mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data\u2014not too hot, not too cold\u2014that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on \u00a0\u201chistorical trends\u201d and the \u201cmarket landscape\u201d from various sectors which have \u201csubstantial\u201d potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft's recent cloud growth, particularly in its Azure service, fell short of expectations, leading to some disappointment among investors. While the company has been a leader in AI-driven growth over the past year, this quarter's results showed a deceleration, raising concerns about whether the momentum gained from AI is starting to wane. This deceleration in cloud revenue, coupled with a significant increase in capital expenditures (CapEx), has led to uncertainty about Microsoft's future growth trajectory.\nDespite these concerns, some investors see any potential dip in Microsoft's stock as a buying opportunity. With its position as a key player in the tech sector, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a strong contender in the market. Investors are also looking for signs in the upcoming earnings report that could serve as catalysts for future growth, particularly in relation to AI-driven profits and overall demand for Microsoft's AI tools.\nGil Luria, a software analyst at D.A. Davidson believes that the guidance provided by Microsoft in its upcoming call is expected to be crucial, as it will reveal whether the company plans to continue increasing its CapEx despite the slower revenue growth. Investors are beginning to adjust their expectations around AI's contribution to Microsoft's business, acknowledging that while the company's AI advancements are impressive, the growth may not be as rapid as previously anticipated.\nBrent Thill, Jefferies analyst emphasized that while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) missed its growth targets, the miss was small, and the company remains well ahead of its competitors in AI. He pointed out that the weakness was largely due to softer demand in Europe and a dip in transactional business during the quarter. Even so, Microsoft\u2019s performance, particularly in AI, continues to outpace expectations, and Thill expects the company to regain momentum in the latter half of the year. Thill continues to rate Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a top pick, maintaining a price target of $550.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has announced upgrades for Recall, an artificial intelligence feature that creates a record of everything users do on their PCs, following criticism that the tool created an attractive target for hackers.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Corner Store Comeback\nA Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nIn an interview Thursday, David Weston, a vice president for enterprise and operating system security, said the company heard the critiques \u201cloud and clear\u201d and set about devising layers of security safeguards for Recall designed to thwart even the world\u2019s most sophisticated hackers.\nIn the soon-to-be-released version, users will be able to filter out specific apps or websites. Sensitive content filtering \u2014 which looks for such things as Social Security numbers or credit card numbers \u2014 will be on by default. In-private browsing in supported applications won\u2019t saved, Weston said.\nUsers can only enable Recall and use it by authenticating themselves using biometric features such as facial recognition or a fingerprint. Data collected by Recall will be stored in an isolated environment, and only information requested by a user will leave that secure space.\nMicrosoft says Recall is intended to serve as \u201can explorable timeline of your PC\u2019s past,\u201d making it easier to sort through it and search. The technology takes periodic snapshots of a computer screen that are stored and analyzed.\nSoon after Recall was announced in May, security researchers warned that bad actors could access and scoop up records gathered by the tool and stored locally on a user\u2019s PC. Those criticisms came as Microsoft was already combating criticism of its internal security practices following a number of high-profile hacks.\nIn June, Microsoft said recall would be shipped in the \u201coff\u201d position on its line of AI-branded PCs. That will continue, with users being required to opt-in to use Recall.\nIn the new version of Recall, sensitive data is encrypted with keys and isolated on a user\u2019s machine, so that even if a computer is infected with malware or stolen, a bad actor won\u2019t be able to access it, Weston said. A biometric match is required to decrypt the data, he said.\nRecall will also time out if it\u2019s not being used \u2014 the default is 15 minutes \u2014 but can be adjusted. \u201cWe want people to have it when they need it but not have it hanging around,\u201d he said.\nThe revised product will be available to consumers in a beta version next month. Recall only operates on Copilot+ PCs, a new class of Windows 11 machines. However, the upgraded Recall won\u2019t be automatically installed on business versions of those PCs, though companies can download it, Weston said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAdam Neumann\u2019s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nElon Musk\u2019s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term \u2018Remigration\u2019\nHow a Short Seller\u2019s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI health stocks.\nAccording to Statista Market Insights, the worldwide artificial intelligence (AI) market is projected to reach a size of $184 billion in 2024. With a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.46% between 2024 and 2030, the market is expected to expand significantly, reaching a total value of $826.70 billion by 2030.

This growth is largely fueled by the increased adoption of AI in diagnostics, drug discovery, robotic surgery, and patient monitoring, as healthcare systems seek more efficient and cost-effective solutions.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nReputable sources such as Fortune Business Insights and McKinsey report similar bullish projections, highlighting that AI\u2019s applications in healthcare are expanding from diagnostics and imaging to personalized medicine and surgery. The FDA's approval of numerous AI-driven tools in recent years underlines this shift. As AI permeates every level of healthcare, the demand for AI-enhanced devices and platforms continues to surge, resulting in massive investments, partnerships, and growing startup valuations, especially in medical imaging and AI-powered therapeutics.\nAccording to Eric Topol, a renowned cardiologist and AI expert, AI is reshaping healthcare by enhancing precision in diagnostics and treatment. In his book \"Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again,\" Topol argues that AI not only boosts efficiency but also provides better patient outcomes through personalized medicine and improved medical imaging. He states, \"AI has the potential to restore the human connection in medicine by allowing doctors more time to focus on their patients, while AI handles data analysis and routine tasks.\" Topol envisions that AI will reduce physician burnout and transform healthcare delivery globally.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected trending health stocks that have AI products driving meaningful revenue gains.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers healthcare cloud solutions that have driven increased revenue from AI-powered tools for healthcare providers. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently unveiled new models within Azure AI Health Insights, which offers tools to help doctors, nurses and researchers make more informed decisions. The model, a patient timeline, gives clinicians a simple, chronological overview of a patient\u2019s medical history by using generative AI to consolidate information from different unstructured data sources. The other model, called clinical report simplification, allows clinicians to use generative AI to simplify reports full of complex medical terminology into language that patients may understand better. And the final model, radiology insights, aims to help clinicians and radiologists by identifying errors and inconsistencies that can come up across different reports. The model can also offer follow-up recommendations.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has seen substantial growth in profits driven by its AI initiatives, particularly through its cloud services and AI-infused products. In fiscal year 2024, AI-related services contributed significantly to the company's revenue growth, particularly in the Azure cloud platform, which saw a 30% increase in revenue, fueled by AI adoption. Microsoft reported an impressive 33% rise in overall profits during the second quarter of FY24, bringing net income to $21.9 billion, largely attributed to AI and cloud services expansion.

Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the \u201cApp Store moment.\u201d\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\u201cAnnual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units.

For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Microsoft on Thursday named former GE finance chief Carolina Dybeck Happe as its chief operations officer, as the tech giant looks to bolster its leadership team while it doubles down on artificial intelligence.\nDybeck Happe, GE's finance chief between March 2020 and September 2023, was instrumental in leading the company's turnaround. She also helped complete the spin-off of energy infrastructure unit GE Vernova in April 2024, after she had stepped down from CFO's role.\nShe has previously held finance head roles at multiple companies, including at A.P. Moeller - Maersk and Swedish access control and security firm Assa Abloy.\nThe appointment comes at a time when Microsoft is aggressively pursuing the lead in the cloud services market and trying to close the gap with Amazon's Amazon Web Services.\n\"In this newly created role, she will join the senior leadership team (SLT), reporting to me,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, adding Dybeck Happe will be crucial in accelerating \"company-wide AI transformation\".\nThe SLT has been key to Microsoft's strategic decisions, including the multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT owner OpenAI, partnerships with other tech giants and even the acquisition of videogame maker Activision Blizzard.\n\"The timing of Dybeck Happe's appointment may coincide with the implementation of lessons learned from the recent Crowdstrike outage that specifically impacted Microsoft devices. Microsoft can not allow this type of event to occur again,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft tapped AI industry veteran Mustafa Suleyman to lead its AI operations and added him to the SLT. Suleyman co-founded DeepMind, which Google acquired in 2014 and now operates as its AI division.\nTo give investors a clearer picture on AI contributions to its financials, Microsoft last month restructured how it reports results for its business units, moving some search and news advertising revenue under the Azure cloud-computing unit.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar, Anil D'Silva and Shinjini Ganguli)\n"

        "Title": "Jim Cramer Reports That \u2018Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Announced A 10% Increase In Its Quarterly Dividend And Approved A New $60 Billion Stock Buyback Program\u2019",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Don\u2019t Miss Out: Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Key Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against Jim Cramer's other key stocks to watch.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer traveled to Dreamforce, to understand the true capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and to separate fact from hype. After diving deep into the topic, he feels more equipped to identify which AI claims are genuine and which are simply marketing fluff. He noted that there seems to be far more misleading information than real advancements.\n\"All right, I had to come all the way out here to Dreamforce, the Salesforce Tech Festival, to learn what artificial intelligence is really capable of and what\u2019s pure hype. After immersing myself in AI, I feel a lot more confident in sorting out the real from the phony. And you know what? There\u2019s a hell of a lot more phony than there is real. That\u2019s why I want to show you which AI claims are meaningless and which ones are legit.\"\nJim Cramer stated that today's market movements show it's possible to navigate unpredictable conditions. He emphasized that we don't need expert predictions to see that interest rates are likely to decrease, which is essential for maintaining a bull market. He advised against overthinking the situation and suggested focusing on profitable opportunities, particularly the growing importance of artificial intelligence.\n\"Today is proof that you can game the ungameable. But you don\u2019t need a San Francisco weatherman to know which way the wind blows. In the end, we know rates are headed lower, not higher, and that\u2019s what we need to sustain this bull market. Please do not overthink it. I\u2019d rather focus on what can help us make some money, like the biggest theme in the world right now: artificial intelligence.\"\nCramer pointed out that while AI is generating excitement in the stock market, its impact on the broader economy has been limited. There are some practical applications, like cost savings in corporate back offices, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. This is why many analysts are starting to label the hype around AI as a bubble.\n\"Specifically, what does AI actually do? We\u2019ve heard so much about this technology and how it\u2019s going to revolutionize everything. Right now, though, we know that while AI has taken the stock market by storm, it really hasn\u2019t taken the actual economy by storm. There are use cases, sure, back office corporate cost savings\u2014nothing flashy. That\u2019s why so many commentators now come on air and call the whole thing a bubble.\"\nJim Cramer explained that AI, especially when combined with advanced computing from chipmakers, significantly speeds up processes and enables machines to act intelligently, similar to capable humans. He noted that businesses aim to create quality products for consumers, but a shortage of workers has become a major issue, particularly highlighted during the COVID pandemic. This has led to sales associates being too busy to engage effectively with customers, resulting in rushed and confusing interactions.\n\"Let me tell you what AI really does. When coupled with accelerated computing, AI makes everything go faster. It rationalizes processes and can make machines behave like smart, good humans. Business wants to produce good products and sell them to real people, whether for enterprises or homes\u2014that\u2019s capitalism 101. But right now, we don't have enough workers to do it.\nCramer pointed out that companies are pushing their employees hard to boost profits, which can create a stressful environment. However, after attending Marc Benioff's keynote, he recognized the potential of a technology called Agent Force. This AI initiative can engage with customers politely, and efficiently answering common questions by using personalized data.\nCramer argued that AI is an ideal solution for customer service, as it can provide clear and friendly assistance without the frustrations that often come from human employees who are overwhelmed and eager to leave. AI agents can listen, reason, and either direct customers appropriately or handle their inquiries on their own.\n\"Companies are already squeezing as much as they can out of their employees to boost stock prices and profits for executives. Then it hit me while watching Marc Benioff's incredible keynote today. He described an initiative called Agent Force, and I realized what this technology can really do. It has time for you, acknowledges you, and is polite. It can almost always answer your questions because there are only so many that get asked regularly, and it has the data to respond your data. It knows your preferences.\nJim Cramer explained that AI offers a better experience than what we currently have. For instance, in retail, AI knows customer preferences, helps with returns, and suggests alternatives based on previous purchases, reducing the need to deal with human salespeople who might be stressed or impatient. If customers are still unhappy, they can opt to talk to a human, but they might prefer the friendly interaction with the AI agent.\n\"So, what AI really is and what it does is provide us with something better than what we currently have. It\u2019s a retailer that knows all about your preferences, can help you return an item, and asks if you want something different from what you bought last time. It frees you from the hassle of a human salesperson who might be frustrated or upset. And if you\u2019re not satisfied, you can still speak to a human if you want to\u2014but I doubt you will, because the AI agent is just so much more pleasant.\"\nCramer added that AI's potential extends beyond retail. He believes that in ten years, we might wonder why we relied on doctors when AI agents could provide kinder, more empathetic care. These AI systems could analyze millions of test results, quickly identifying serious health issues like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer, making it easier to spot dangerous patterns before they become serious problems. AI's ability to compile and analyze data effectively is key to this advancement.\n\"It\u2019s not just retail. In ten years, I think we\u2019ll wonder why we ever wasted a doctor\u2019s time when AI agents were so much better, kinder, and more empathetic. Doctors could analyze millions of test results that might have taken a decade to sort through, identifying dangerous patterns well before they become problematic\u2014like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer. It\u2019s all in the data, and only AI can compile it in an accessible way.\"\nAdditionally, Jim Cramer pointed out that self-driving cars are becoming more common and are significantly safer than human drivers since they don't get distracted or impaired. He noted that AI can also handle tasks like proofreading and correcting errors without making mistakes. This efficiency allows law firms to operate with fewer associates.\n\"We see self-driving cars everywhere. They\u2019re much safer than human drivers. They don\u2019t drink and drive\u2014they don\u2019t even drink. An AI agent can proofread, correct, and never make a mistake. Law firms can now hire half as many associates because of this efficiency\"\nFinally, Cramer emphasized that AI agents often perform better than humans in most situations. For repetitive tasks, he believes it's preferable to interact with a courteous and efficient AI rather than a stressed or frustrated human who may not want to engage.\n\"The bottom line is that if you let the AI agent do its job, it will outperform humans in the vast majority of cases. And for repetitive tasks, trust me: you\u2019d much rather have a polite and friendly AI agent than a harried, angry, or exhausted human who really doesn\u2019t want to deal with you.\"\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, highlighting ten key stocks he reviewed.

        "Author": "  Ethan Gach ",
        "Text": "Microsoft is laying off another 650 employees from its Xbox gaming division, the company announced in an overnight companywide memo. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer stressed that no new games were being cancelled or studio closed as a result of the latest round of cuts.\nThe executive wrote in the memo, the full text of which was reported on by Game File, IGN, and others, that the layoffs were part of the ongoing integration with Activision Blizzard, the publisher of Call of Duty and other massive franchises, which Microsoft acquired for $69 billion last October after a lengthy regulatory fight. The 650 roles cut are \u201cmostly corporate and supporting functions,\u201d according to Spencer.\n\u201cSeparately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games,\u201d the executive, who has overseen a years-long acquisition spree of game studio sand publishers, wrote. \u201cNo games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.\u201d\nThat\u2019s in contrast to the 1,900 layoffs announced at the beginning of the year which saw deep cuts to game development staff across various studios, including the cancellation of an unannounced fantasy survival crafting game at Blizzard. Then in May, Microsoft revealed that Hi-Fi Rush maker Tango Gameworks and Prey maker Arkane Austin, as well as two other teams under the Bethesda umbrella, would be shuttered. Tango Gameworks was recently resurrected by South Korean game publisher Krafton.\nThere has reportedly been increased pressure on the Xbox division within Microsoft to be more profitable following the long and costly acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which is set to release Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 next month. \u201cWe run a business,\u201d Spencer said in an interview last month. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company, because we get a level of support from the company that\u2019s just amazing and what we\u2019re able to go do.\u201d\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n"

        "Title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThoughMicrosoft has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), its stock has lagged behind the broader market. With an 8.8% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index's return of 20.7% and 18.4%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether Microsoft's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance.\nMicrosoft has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and integrating AI capabilities across its product suite. This strategic move has positioned Microsoft as a leader in the AI space, potentially opening up new revenue streams and enhancing existing ones. Despite these moves, investors seem to be taking a cautious stance, perhaps waiting for concrete evidence of how these AI initiatives will translate into revenue growth and profitability.\nMicrosoft is rapidly integrating AI across its product lineup, from search engines to cloud computing, leveraging AI to enhance its offerings and challenge competitors in various markets.\nOne of Microsoft's boldest moves is the integration of ChatGPT-like capabilities into Bing, directly challenging Google's search dominance. This initiative, coupled with the expansion of Azure AI, Microsoft's cloud-based AI platform, demonstrates the company's commitment to AI-driven growth. Azure AI has seen remarkable adoption, with its customer base growing nearly 60% year over year to more than 60,000 clients. For fiscal first-quarter 2025, Microsoft projects Intelligent Cloud revenues between $28.6 billion and $28.9 billion, with Azure expected to achieve 28-29% revenue growth at constant currency.\nThe company's productivity suite, Microsoft 365, is also benefiting from AI integration. Features like AI-powered writing assistance in Word and smart data analysis in Excel are enhancing user productivity, potentially leading to higher adoption rates and increased customer retention. These improvements could significantly impact Microsoft's recurring revenue streams.\nMicrosoft's Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool, is making waves across various sectors. GitHub Copilot, adopted by over 77,000 organizations, including BBVA and FedEx, has seen 180% year-over-year growth, driving GitHub's revenues to a $2 billion annual run rate. The launch of Copilot+ PCs, featuring new system architecture and advanced silicon technology, promises to deliver breakthrough AI experiences and enhanced productivity. Recently, Microsoft expanded the Copilot+ PC portfolio with the introduction of a new silicon technology \u2014 AMD Ryzen AI 300 series and Intel Core Ultra 200V series.\nThe integration of generative AI into Microsoft's Power Platform has enabled over 480,000 organizations to leverage AI capabilities, with monthly active users growing 40% year over year to 48 million. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is rapidly becoming indispensable for knowledge workers, with its daily users nearly doubling quarter over quarter.\nAs Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, the challenge lies in translating these technological advancements into tangible financial results. Success will be measured by increased market share in search, accelerated growth in cloud services and improved adoption rates for productivity tools. Investors and industry watchers will be closely monitoring Microsoft's ability to leverage its AI capabilities into market-beating performance as the AI landscape evolves.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT's fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $277.39 billion, indicating 13.2% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.04, indicating 10.5% growth year over year.\nMicrosoft's recent stock underperformance, despite its AI initiatives, highlights the complex factors influencing tech sector valuations. While the company pushes forward with AI integration across its product line, broader market concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to impact investor sentiment.\nThe AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet-owned Google, Amazon and Meta Platforms making significant investments. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to AI-driven growth prospects across the industry.\nMicrosoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.71X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.98X and its own historical median of 10.1X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.\nAs Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance.\nWhile Microsoft's 8.8% YTD gain appears modest compared to the broader market and industry performance, the company's aggressive moves in AI present a potential catalyst for future growth. The successful integration and monetization of AI across its product lines could open up new revenue streams, enhance Microsoft's competitive position and drive the stock further.\nHowever, investors should also be mindful of the challenges, including intense competition and potential regulatory hurdles. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present. New investors should, however, wait for a better entry point for Microsoft.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Bill Gates explains the keys to his success during Microsoft\u2019s early years",
        "Author": "  Jason Ma ",
        "Text": "Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates looked at the big picture and the small picture as he was growing his software company in the early years.\nIn an interview with CNBC's Make It published on Wednesday, the tech billionaire revealed that his definition of success included his software and its global impact.\n\"Back then, it was just: Is my code really good? Does it work? And can this company show the world that these microcomputers are big?\" Gates said.\nHis view also spoke to his evangelism about the potential of personal computers to transform business and society. While the PC's impact is clear now, it wasn't obvious to everyone four decades ago, even to some of the early innovators.\nIn 1981, IBM launched its PC and famously estimated that it would only sell 241,683 units over a five-year period. Instead, it sold about 3 million in that time and hundreds of millions over a decade.\nOf course, all those PCs needed software, and that's where Gates saw an opportunity, applying a relentless single-mindedness to it.\n\"It was the magic of software,\" he told CNBC. \"And I was willing to focus my life, in my 20s, just on software, just on the one job.\"\nIn fact, he and Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen had a vision of putting a PC on every desk and in every home, \"which sounds boring today, but back then [it] was completely crazy,\" Gates added.\nLooking back on those early years, he characterized his view of success as \"very much Microsoft-centric,\" describing his life during his 20s as \"all Microsoft, all the time.\"\nGates stepped down as CEO in 2000, gave up his day-to-day duties in 2008, relinquished his chairmanship role in 2014, and left the board in 2020. Now focused on his philanthropy, he said his definition of success has evolved and includes \"adding net value\" to the world as well as empowering other people.\nDuring a commencement address to Northern Arizona University\u2019s graduating class in 2023, he expressed some regret for his approach to work in Microsoft's early years, when he said he didn't believe in weekends or vacations and pushed others to put in long hours.\n\"As I got older\u2014and especially once I became a father\u2014I realized that both in terms of doing your best work and having a great life, that that intensity was not always appropriate,\" he said. \"Don\u2019t wait as long as I did to learn this lesson.\"\nBut he still plans on staying busy, telling CNBC earlier that he intends to keep working for at least another two decades if his health allows\u2014following in the footsteps of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. That\u2019s because retirement \u201csounds awful\u201d to Gates.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Explainer: Microsoft leads Big Tech data centre investment boom driven by energy hungry AI",
        "Author": "  Lara Williams ",
        "Text": "News of Microsoft\u2019s $3.3bn investment in a state-of-the-art AI data centre in the US state of Wisconsin demonstrates a marked trend in data centre investment by the companies driving energy hungry AI development.\nA few days after Microsoft\u2019s Wisconsin AI data centre announcement, the company announced (13 May) that it will invest $4.3bn in cloud and AI infrastructure in France, expanding its data centre footprint across existing sites in Paris and Marseille as well as a new data centre campus in the Grand Est Region, in Mulhouse Alsace Agglom\u00e9ration.\nIn March, The Information reported that Microsoft\u00a0and OpenAI are planning a $100bn US data centre, including an AI supercomputer called Stargate, which is scheduled for completion by 2028. According to reports, the facility is said to be 100 times more costly than some of the world\u2019s biggest existing data centres. Verdict reached out to Microsoft to confirm the report, but the company did not confirm or deny the report.\nAnd in November 2023, Microsoft announced it would invest $2.5bn in its UK operations over the next three years to expand its AI data centre infrastructure across a number of sites. The investment is the largest Microsoft has made, to date, in the UK.\nVast amounts are being spent by Big Tech to ensure that cloud computing and AI infrastructure are in place to facilitate a lead on AI development. According to data from research and analysis company GlobaData, which tracked investment by the big five \u2013 Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Apple \u2013 in data centres from 2019 to date, investment has already soared in 2024 compared to previous years. Investment jumped from $8.8bn in 2023 to $37bn in announced investments in 2024.\nMicrosoft\u2019s investment in data centres far outweighs its Big Tech rivals, according to GlobalData. Microsoft invested $5.8bn in data centre capacity in 2023 increasing its investment to $23.7 in 2024 so far. In comparison, Amazon has invested $6.1bn and Alphabet $4.4 in 2024, so far.\nMicrosoft's $10bn investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI created an alliance which sees OpenAI CEO Sam Altman the more nimble newcomer to the old line tech giant. Altman has been on an energy sourcing mission to drive AI development, a move which can only increase Microsoft's lead in the field.\nIn January, Altman addressed his energy concerns to an audience at Davos warning that an energy \"breakthrough\" would be critical for future AI development as the technology will require exponentially increasing amounts of compute power.\nAltman's focus on energy dates back long before his warning to global leaders at Davos. In 2021, he publicly revealed his personal investment of $375m in nuclear fusion startup Helion, which is reportedly his largest investment to date. On 10 May, it was announced that Microsoft had signed a power purchase agreement with Helion to buy electricity from the startup by 2028 when it aims to start producing electricity. The agreement is the first of its kind between a nuclear fusion company and a potential customer.\nIn April, Altman's investment in solar power company Exowatt, a startup focused on producing energy to power data centres was made public. Exowatt co-founder Jack Abraham posted on LinkedIn that the company has, \"invented a new solar technology that can power the future of AI and data centres with lower electricity costs than fossil fuels. We have significant deployments coming this year.\"\nAltman's quest for energy innovation may not come quick enough. Meanwhile, existing data centre technology is reforming to address AI's new energy requirements. Equinix is one of the world\u2019s two biggest data centre co-location companies with 260 data centres across 33 countries and five continents. Equinix UK managing director Bruce Owen told Verdict that hosting high performance computing systems (like AI applications) leads to higher power density per rack or floor area in data centres.\n\u201cAs businesses, organisations and individuals try to leverage AI for machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and healthcare, for example, the demand for high performance computing and therefore power is growing,\u201d said Owen.\nThe energy consumption of AI workloads has significant implications for data centre design and operations, according to Owen. \u201cPower-hungry AI workloads pose challenges for our teams at Equinix in terms of power distribution, cooling, and overall operational efficiency,\u201d he said.\nThe data centre industry is using methods including energy-efficient hardware, adopting renewable energy sources through power purchase agreements, and designing energy-efficient infrastructure to try and mitigate energy requirements.\nEquinix is implementing infrastructure to support advanced cooling systems like direct to chip liquid cooling, enabling efficient, high-density deployments for compute-intensive workloads like AI. The company is also working with customers in trialing quantum and immersion cooling.\n\u201cWe plan to support direct-to-chip liquid cooling in over 45 metros, this expansion allows customers to deploy advanced liquid cooling solutions tailored to their mission-critical needs,\u201d said Owen.\nBut despite innovation in data centre energy efficiency, the net result of the AI revolution will be increased energy consumption, said GlobalData senior analyst Beatriz Valle.\nAgainst the backdrop of the current competitive landscape in GenAI, Microsoft\u2019s investment in a new data centre footprint is par for the course, according to Valle, who notes that the data centre industry has become geopolitically significant.\n\u201cA lack of global trade cooperation and much rivalry, as seen, for example, in the case of the US sanctions stopping Nvidia, and other semiconductor vendors, from selling to Chinese companies, all this is translating into enhanced government investment, by the US and the EU, poured into new data centre construction to accelerate AI and to avoid relying on technology manufactured by countries that may not be strategically aligned,\u201d said Valle.\nIndeed, President Biden's presence and role in announcing Microsoft's Wisconsin data centre footprint expansion was conspicuous and served as a campaigning opportunity for his re-election in the upcoming US Presidential Election.\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop towards increased deglobalisation and trade barriers, investment in semiconductor technologies and data center facilities has become top of mind, and both the US and EU are pouring money into this.\nWisconsin is a good area to invest in, far from large urban centers and probably safer from a legal and environmental perspective than coastal cities (and cheaper),\u201d added Valle.\n\"Explainer: Microsoft leads Big Tech data centre investment boom driven by energy hungry AI\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) closed the latest trading day at $433.51, indicating a -0.4% change from the previous session's end. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.28%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.15%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.15%.\nThe software maker's shares have seen an increase of 4.43% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.02% and the S&P 500's gain of 2%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Microsoft in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $3.09, reflecting a 3.34% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $64.45 billion, indicating a 14.04% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.04 per share and revenue of $277.6 billion. These totals would mark changes of +10.51% and +13.25%, respectively, from last year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Microsoft. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. At present, Microsoft boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nLooking at valuation, Microsoft is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 33.39. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 28.79 for its industry.\nWe can also see that MSFT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.31. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Software industry stood at 2.39 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 75, this industry ranks in the top 30% of all industries, numbering over 250.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Chloe Berger ",
        "Text": "Smart alecks rub most people the wrong way, including, but not limited to, Satya Nadella. Taking the helm at the software company 10 years ago, Nadella wasn\u2019t afraid of making waves and pushing his new employees to think differently.\nInstead of resting on its laurels, Microsoft must \u201cstay humble, stay hungry, and exhibit a growth mindset,\u201d he told Fortune\u2019s Jeremy Kahn.\nThose who live by a growth mindset \u201cbelieve that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work\u2014brains and talent are just the starting point,\u201d Carol Dweck, coiner of the term and a Stanford psychologist, said in 2015. That\u2019s contrasted with a fixed mindset, wherein people believe their skills are innate or a fixed quality, or that \u201ctalent alone creates success.\u201d\nRead more: Satya Nadella returned Microsoft to the top by showing humility as CEO. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s done\nNadella doesn\u2019t buy the latter concept. Staying on your toes in the ever-developing tech world where AI is changing the game means sometimes being willing to dance a bit, or move with the flow.\nIndeed, the growth mindset has become the software company\u2019s most favored buzzword of the decade, leaping from every intro psych class textbook into the speeches of Microsoft executives. The shift from being a \u201cknow-it-all\u201d to \u201clearn-it-all\u201d is a defining part of Nadella\u2019s messaging when it comes to his desired workplace culture, writes Kahn.\nAt Microsoft, being a learn-it-all requires an embrace of upskilling, according to a company blog post,\u00a0which said it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, to gain new skills if a company's culture says \"we\u2019ve learned all we can.\"\n\u201cIf you take two kids at school, one of them has more innate capability but is a know-it-all. The other person has less innate capability but is a learn-it-all. The learn-it-all does better than the know-it-all,\u201d Nadella said back in 2019 on the podcast Hello Monday.\nThat\u2019s a sharp left turn from a pre-Nadella culture, explained Scott Hanselman, vice president of Microsoft\u2019s developer community.\nThe change is seen down to the software itself. Hanselman said the tech giant had a reputation for forcing developers to use the company\u2019s entire tech stack. There\u2019s less of a top-down approach at play currently, as developers are now allowed to select certain features to implement and are asked for feedback on what they\u2019d like to see from the company.\n\u201cAzure is beholden to them; they are the customer, and they will keep using it if they find it helpful and delightful,\u201d he told Kahn.\nNadella isn\u2019t the only one imploring employees to learn more. Implementing a new way of work was trying at first, Kathleen Hogan, chief people officer at Microsoft, explained in 2019. Making the shift was \u201ctricky to navigate because many people wanted a simpler narrative of \u2018This is good; that was bad,\u2019\u201d she said. Rejecting this more rigid way of viewing things, she explained that \u201cit was really important for us to say, \u2018This is how we have to evolve to be relevant in the future,\u2019 versus being dismissive of the past.\u201d\nAnd as Nadella charges forward after a decade of leadership, he remains loyal to this concept of staying fluid and constantly growing or changing.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Microsoft (MSFT) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT).\nMicrosoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 90% and 7.5% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>The ABR suggests buying Microsoft, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $13.04.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microsoft.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Short Seller Sentiment Is Bullish",
        "Author": "  Fatima Gulzar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other American tech stocks.\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n% of shares shorted: 0.74%\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of two public cloud providers capable of delivering a broad range of PaaS/IaaS solutions at scale. The business has become a leader in AI as well, mainly because of its investment in OpenAI. Notably, the American tech company has had remarkable success upselling customers on higher-priced Office 365 subscriptions that come with advanced phone functionality. These elements work together to create a more concentrated business that produces remarkable revenue growth, high and rising margins, and strengthens relationships with clients.\nShares of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently dropped after the company's most recent quarterly reports revealed that its Cloud business growth was less than anticipated. The company has revised its revenue estimate for the current quarter to between $63.8B and $64.8B from the $65.07B estimate. Azure revenue for MSFT is anticipated to grow by 28% and 29% annually.\nThe integration of Copilot AI, according to analysts, is responsible for the firm's development across several areas in its latest quarter. Office commercial sales grew by 10% YoY $48 billion, while Dynamics software sales have increased by 19% YoY. Bing also experienced a 3% YoY spike in users switching from Google Search because of its AI features.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nThe tech giant has hedge fund sentiments of 279 in Q2 2024. Michael Larson's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the largest shareholder in the company, with 34,889,597 shares worth $15.60 billion.\nOverall MSFT ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 20 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology, Inc. MU.\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates aggressively and penciled in further rate cuts by the end of the year. It slashed the benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.75-5% for the first time since March 2020.\nInterest rates have been hovering at a 23-year high to combat relentless price pressures. However, signs of inflationary pressure have ebbed recently, giving the Fed all the more reason to cut interest rates aggressively and let investors know that the central bank is not behind the curve.\nA lower interest rate scenario may lead to stock gains for major artificial intelligence (AI) tech players like NVIDIA Corp., Microsoft Corp. \u00a0and Micron Technology, Inc. This is because interest rate cuts reduce their borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Interest rate cuts also don\u2019t disrupt the cash flows needed for growth initiatives to enhance shareholder\u2019s wealth.\nBy the way, the euphoria about the AI revolution hasn\u2019t faded. It\u2019s here to stay and should drive the prices of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron northward. After all, NVIDIA provides technology for AI applications, Microsoft builds AI resources for its customers and Micron is a memory specialist. AI\u2019s data centers require a lot of memory.\nAccording to Statista, the AI industry is expected to grow beyond $184 billion in 2024 and continue to expand until 2030, with an estimated market size of $826 billion (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\nEven so, let\u2019s look at other reasons why NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron\u2019s shares have more room to run.\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, as huge chunks of data are transferred from the central processing units to graphic processing units (GPU), NVIDIA will gain due to its bulk share in the GPU market. Precedence Research noted that the GPU market is expected to grow to $1,414.39 billion in 2034 from $75.77 billion in the current year at a CAGR of 13.8%.\nSince developers rely more on the CUDA software platform than AMD's ROCm software platform, NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs have a wide competitive moat. NVIDIA\u2019s data center GPU business revenues were $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80 for NVDA\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) is up 76.1% from the prior year (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\n\u00a0\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure and cloud services business has picked up steam, with revenues from this segment increasing 29% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud infrastructure unit is expanding faster than Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has dominated the cloud computing market for quite some time.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure could soon overtake AWS since it has grown from half the size of AWS in 2019 to about three quarters now. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.04 for MSFT\u2019s EPS is up 5% year over year (read more: Microsoft Unveils $60 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy MSFT Stock?).\nIncreasing demand for Micron\u2019s high-bandwidth memory chips (HBM) has led the company to use its full production capacity and is expected to boost the bottom line. Management noted that revenues from the HBM market are estimated to be $86 billion by 2030 from $1.8 billion last year.\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI graphic cards also use Micron\u2019s HBM chips, so the demand is expected to improve. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 for MU\u2019s EPS is up 160.3% on a year-over-year basis (read more: Death Cross for MU Stock: Time to Buy Micron Based on Fundamentals?).\nGiven the positives, well-known brokers have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 28.8% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $115.59. Analysts\u2019 highest price target is $200, an upside of 73%.\nProminent brokers have also increased MSFT\u2019s average short-term price target by 14.8% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $435.15. The highest price target is $600, an upside of 37.9%.\nMU\u2019s average short-term price target, too, has been raised 74.4% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $88.73. The highest price target is $225, an upside of 153.6%.\nOver the past year, the shares of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron have soared 168.4%, 34.3%, and 25.4%, respectively.\nAll these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Author": "  Will Wade ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is going to pay a hefty premium for power from the soon-to-be-restarted Three Mile Island nuclear plant, a recognition that carbon-free electricity is more valuable when it\u2019s available around the clock.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\nThe company will pay owner Constellation Energy Corp. at least $100 a megawatt-hour for power from the Pennsylvania plant, according to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, while Jefferies LLC puts the figure at about $112. That compares to about $60 a megawatt-hour for wind and solar energy available now in the same region, according to Jefferies.\nBig technology companies are racing to line up power supplies for the massive data centers needed to run artificial intelligence systems. Surging demand for power is prompting utilities to build more natural gas-fired plants, undermining lofty environmental goals for both the industry and tech firms. It\u2019s also driving up interest in nuclear plants that deliver clean energy at all hours, including the deal Constellation announced last week to restart Three Mile Island to feed power to Microsoft.\n\u201cPeople say power is just a commodity,\u201d BI utilities analyst Nikki Hsu said. \u201cNuclear power doesn\u2019t seem to be a commodity now.\u201d\nConstellation plans to reopen a reactor that was shut in 2019 because it couldn\u2019t compete economically, bringing it back into service in 2028. A second reactor at the facility permanently closed 45 years ago after a partial meltdown in what was the worst US nuclear accident.\nThe companies haven\u2019t disclosed terms of the 20-year deal, though financial details in a Constellation presentation gave analysts enough data to make estimates. Constellation declined to comment on the analysts\u2019 estimates while Microsoft didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\nThe deal should provide Constellation with about $785 million in annual revenue by 2030, according to Paul Zimbardo, an analyst at Jefferies. That\u2019s enough to justify the $1.6 billion the company expects to spend to restart the reactor.\n\u201cThat is not cheap for electricity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy premium to what you would pay if you just bought grid power.\u201d\n--With assistance from Dina Bass.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nMilitary Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nThe Presidential Election Isn\u2019t Stopping International Students From Coming to America\nApple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "China's Ant Group, Tencent Holdings, and Baidu have teamed up with US tech giants Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms to develop the world's first international standard for large language model (LLM) security for supply chains, as the need for artificial intelligence (AI) governance grows more urgent.\nThe companies unveiled their \"Large Language Model Security Requirements for Supply Chain\" on Friday with the World Digital Technology Academy (WDTA), during a side event at the Inclusion Conference on the Bund in Shanghai.\nThis new standard, which covers the entire life cycle of LLMs, is part of the WDTA's broader AI Safety, Trust, and Responsibility initiative. Established in Geneva in April 2023 under a United Nations framework, the WDTA aims to provide comprehensive measures for managing security risks across the supply chain, such as data leaks, model tampering and supplier non-compliance.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe standard was drafted and reviewed by experts from leading Chinese and US technology firms, along with top academic and industry institutions, including the Cloud Security Alliance Greater China Region and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\"International cooperation on AI-related standards has become increasingly crucial,\" WDTA Honorary Chairman Peter Major told the audience during the side event at the Inclusion Conference on the Bund.

Photo: 2024 Inclusion Conference on the Bund>\n\"International cooperation on AI-related standards has become increasingly crucial as artificial intelligence continues to advance and impact various sectors globally,\" Peter Major, Chair of the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development and Honorary Chairman of the WDTA, said during a panel discussion.\nThe latest standard comes after two earlier generative AI (GenAI) standards, which were also the result of collaboration between Chinese and Western tech firms. The \"Generative AI Application Security Testing and Validation Standard\" and the \"Large Language Model Security Testing Method\" were published in April at a WDTA event.\n\"There's a lot of ambiguity and uncertainty currently around large language models and other emerging technologies, which makes it hard for institutions, companies and governments to decide what would be a meaningful standard,\" Lars Ruddigkeit, Microsoft's technology strategist, said in the same panel. \"For me, the WDTA supply chain standard tries to bring this first road to a safe future on track.\"\nAs businesses and individuals increasingly adopt GenAI, tech companies have called for measures to keep the technology safe. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, upon resuming his role in November after a brief ousting, said \"investing in full-stack safety efforts\" would be a priority for the company.\nIn July 2023, China became the first country to regulate GenAI and related services by issuing rules telling service providers to uphold \"core socialist values\", among other requirements. Since then, Beijing has whitelisted LLMs from several tech companies - including Ant, Baidu and Tencent - for commercial use.\nSome international standards and regulations on AI existed before the GenAI that followed the release of ChatGPT in late 2022.\nIn 2021, Unesco, the UN's heritage body, introduced a \"Recommendation on the Ethics of AI\", which has been adopted by 193 member states.\nBetween 2022 and 2023, the International Organization for Standardisation, a Geneva-based non-governmental group, published AI-related guidelines on system management, risk management and systems using machine learning.\nIn the US, California's legislature is expected to pass SB 1047, one of the nation's first major frameworks for regulating AI systems, although critics argue it may impose burdens on AI innovation and research.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Title": "Microsoft to face higher competition scrutiny in Germany, including over its use of AI",
        "Author": "  Natasha Lomas ",
        "Text": "Microsoft has joined an exclusive club of tech giants that are subject to a special abuse control regime in Germany. The country's Federal Cartel Office (FCO) confirmed on Monday that the software giant could face restrictions if the competition authority deems an intervention is necessary.\nThe designation, which lasts for five years, is important, as it lets the German authority take a close interest in how Microsoft wields its influence through its activities around generative AI.\nHowever, the regulator said it has yet to take any decisions on \"possible proceedings.\"\nIn recent years, Microsoft's influence on OpenAI has landed the pair on antitrust regulators' radars. The cozy relationship even saw Microsoft briefly hire OpenAI front-man Sam Altman and other key staffers last fall during a board dispute.\nAlthough Altman ended up staying at OpenAI, the episode underscored the closeness between the two companies, and Microsoft even got a board observer seat at OpenAI (it gave it up this summer). However, careful structuring of their arrangement appears to have kept it flying for now.\nThe FCO has already looked at the two companies' partnership, and it found last November that their relationship did not meet the threshold for a traditional merger review. However, now that the regulator is armed with more proactive and wide-ranging powers to regulate Big Tech, Microsoft's dealings with OpenAI could face closer scrutiny in Germany going forward.\nThe FCO's press release highlights how Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant is used \"in many parts\" of its ecosystem. It also links the company's strength in cloud computing to helping it enter partnerships with \"highly innovative suppliers,\" as it can \"offer their\u00a0AI\u00a0models as services on Azure and integrate them into its own products.\"\nCommenting in a statement, Andreas Mundt, president of the FCO, also highlighted Microsoft's long history of software dominance, adding:\u00a0\u201cToday, Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem is stronger and more closely interconnected than ever before, because overarching all of its activities is the increasing use of the cloud and\u00a0AI, key technologies in which Microsoft has consolidated its strong position by developing its own products and entering into cooperation\ns\ns\n\"\nThe FCO began investigating whether the tech giant's market power met the bar for the special abuse controls regime back in March 2023. And this confirmation that the company has \u201cparamount significance for competition across markets\u201d unlocks a range of powers contained in the 2021 update to Germany's antitrust rulebook. The reform aims to counteract concerns that Big Tech's market power is hampering rivals' ability to innovate and compete.\nThe German law already applies to Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, and predates the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), a similar ex-ante competition reform that is also being used to clip Big Tech's wings.\nHowever, the DMA applies operational controls only to named platforms, while the FCO has designated Microsoft as a whole. This means the German authority has greater freedom to impose controls on Microsoft's activities, including around AI, if it judges the company's actions are crimping competition.\nThe EU's DMA was drafted before the boom in generative AI tools made ChatGPT a household name. Microsoft is designated as a gatekeeper, but only two of its platforms are directly regulated: the Windows operating system and its social network LinkedIn. That limits the European Commission's ability to intervene in Microsoft's activities in AI unless they specifically fall within these two \"core platform services.\"\n\u201cOur decision applies to Microsoft as a whole, not only to individual services or products,\" Mundt emphasized. \"Based on our decision, we can stop anti-competitive practices which are not covered by the\u00a0DMA.\u201d\nReached for comment on the FCO's designation, Microsoft spokesperson Robin Koch wrote: \u201cWe recognize our responsibility to support a healthy competitive environment and we will strive to be proactive, collaborative and responsible in working with the Bundeskartellamt [FCO]. Microsoft is partnering with Germany's most innovative companies, and we're committed to investing in the growth of its digital economy.\u201d\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/microsoft-german-fco https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/20/microsoft-openai-competition-concernsThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/microsoft-to-face-higher-competition-scrutiny-in-germany-including-over-its-use-of-ai/\n"

        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Microsoft's hiring of artificial intelligence startup Inflection's staff including its co-founders will not be scrutinised under European Union merger rules, EU antitrust regulators said on Wednesday.\nThe European Commission said seven EU countries had dropped their requests asking it to examine the deal. The move followed a ruling from Europe's top court earlier this month prohibiting the EU enforcer from examining merger cases which fall below the EU's merger revenue threshold.\nJudges said the EU antitrust watchdog was also not allowed to encourage its national peers to ask it to take up such cases.\nCritics said these merger powers were regulatory over-reach while the Commission said such deals could be killer acquisitions in which big companies acquire startups to shut them down.\n\"All seven member states that submitted an initial referral have decided to withdraw their requests. Therefore, the Commission will take no decision in this matter,\" the EU executive said.\nStill it said the deal amounted to a merger as it means the 'new Inflection' would shift its focus to a different activity, namely its AI studio business.\n\"The Commission regards the agreements entered into between Microsoft and Inflection as a structural change in the market that amounts to a concentration as defined under Article 3 of the EUMR,\" it said, referring to the bloc's merger rules.\nMicrosoft welcomed the announcement.\n\"We continue to be confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\nThe company hired in March co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karen Simonyan and most of Inflection's 70-strong team for a newly created unit called Microsoft AI to consolidate and expand its AI offerings for consumer products.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n"

In addition, it's reported that no business unit leaders at Xbox or any of its affiliated gaming-related teams will be affected.\nSpencer allegedly goes on to say that no game studios are being closed as part of these latest layoffs, and no \"games, devices or experiences are being canceled,\" even if \"there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.\"\nIt's already been a challenging year for Microsoft Gaming employees. Back in January, it was announced that around 1,900 people from across the Activision Blizzard, Zenimax, and Xbox teams were being laid off. Later, it was announced that studios Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks were being closed, too (although the latter was later revived by Krafton).\nIn today's email, Spencer reportedly says the company is \"deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues,\" noting that affected staff will be supported with \"exit packages\" that include \"severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services\" in the US, and adds: \"I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players.\"\nTiny Tina's Wonderlands and Diablo 4 support studio lays off 139 out of 200 workers as Embracer Group fallout continues.\n"

        "Text": "The N-able data revealed a related increase in backups among its partners, helping them become more ransomware-resilient to address the growing number of threats and attacks.\nBURLINGTON, Mass., September 19, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--N-able, Inc. (NYSE: NABL), a global software company helping IT services providers deliver remote monitoring and management, data protection as-a-service, and security solutions, today announced new data showing an increase in Microsoft 365 backups among its partners and a 56% increase in disaster recovery events related to Microsoft 365 domains.\nAccording to a report by Critical Start\u2019s Cyber Research Unit (CRU), over 3,400 high and critical cyber alerts were recorded in the first half of 2024, with a 46.15% rise in attacks compared to 2023. Despite Microsoft 365 offering excellent productivity tools for organizations, the rise in cyberattacks still leaves most companies vulnerable. External and internal threats, accidental deletion, and regional compliance regulations make backing up Microsoft 365 data vitally important.\n\"Backup has been a necessity for 30 years, and the need remains to protect against accidental data deletion or insider threats. However, with cyberattacks not only increasing, but becoming more sophisticated, MSPs need a backup architecture that is ransomware-resilient,\" said Chris Groot, General Manager of Cove Data Protection at N-able. \"MSPs understand that ransomware organizations have been very vocal about their ability to compromise basic backup, and we\u2019ve seen cases where known backup file extensions are specifically targeted. The ever-growing dangers of ransomware and cyberattacks cause businesses a great deal of anxiety, and MSPs need to position themselves as trusted advisors to help identify the right tools and solutions to protect businesses in the best way.\"\nAccording to the N-able 2024 Horizons Report, 67% of surveyed MSPs expect to grow the managed backup services part of their business. Cove Data Protection product data shows that:\n56% increase in disaster recovery events related to Microsoft 365 domains.\n1,000 more MSPs offer backup services for Microsoft 365 with Cove, compared to last year.\nMSPs are protecting over 2.2 million Microsoft 365 end users with Cove, a 46% increase compared to last year.\nThese MSPs are backing up 42 petabytes of Microsoft 365 data, up from 26 petabytes last year. This is equivalent to watching a film in 4K for over 700 years.\n\"Ransomware continues to be one of our biggest concerns when it comes to protecting our customers,\" said Simon Beckett, Director, DynaCom IT Support Ltd. \"Being able to effectively protect Microsoft 365 data, which is one of the highest areas of risk when it comes to this type of attack, is critical. In addition, the uptick in compliance requirements mandates this level of protection on many fronts. We\u2019ve been an avid Cove customer for about a decade and it\u2019s really a no-brainer to help ensure we\u2019re doing backup and disaster recovery right for our customers.\"\nTo learn more about how Cove Data Protection has changed the game, visit: https://www.n-able.com/products/cove-data-protection.\nAbout N-able\nN-able fuels IT services providers with powerful software solutions to monitor, manage, and secure their customers\u2019 systems, data, and networks.

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "During the PC boom of the 1990s, Microsoft introduced Clippy as a friendly face to help users hone their word-processing skills. An animated paper clip with round cartoon eyes and expressive eyebrows floating over a sheet of yellow legal paper, Clippy would frequently and spontaneously pop out of the corner of the screen to provide advice and tips on saving files and using good grammar. Clippy was also almost universally hated, his shifting eyes and unsolicited feedback providing more irritation than comfort.\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff believes Microsoft is on its way to a repeat act of creating a loathsome program meant to assist users in Copilot, the tech company\u2019s foray into AI-powered assistance.\n\u201cWe all know now that Microsoft Copilot is basically the new Microsoft Clippy, that customers have not gotten value from it,\u201d Benioff said in a Bloomberg interview Thursday during Salesforce\u2019s Dreamforce conference in San Francisco.\nMicrosoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, the large language model powering Copilot. Launched in November 2023, Copilot promised to help expedite menial office tasks like summarizing Teams meetings and draft emails. Chemical company Dow plans to introduce the assistant to its 35,900 employees by the end of the year after a successful pilot test, but others aren\u2019t sold on the program\u2019s $30-per-month costs\u2014particularly after Microsoft has had to iron out Copilot Designer\u2019s issue of generating inappropriate images and its Recall feature that took excessive screenshots, jeopardizing user privacy.\nOf course, Benioff\u2019s criticisms of Copilot are in Salesforce\u2019s best interest. The software giant announced a \u201chard pivot\u201d to Agentforce, its own AI assistant program. The program, introduced last week, promises to integrate with hundreds of other applications to streamline business operations. It\u2019s part of a growing movement of implementing AI agents over copilots to take tech assistance one step further.\n\u201cThis is like we're selling science projects to companies, and they're tired of it. They have not gotten the value, which is why you see these customers so excited they're coming here,\u201d Benioff said. \u201cAnd they're getting immediate value, and they're able to use this next generation platform to do everything that they've heard that's possible.\u201d\nBenioff is banking on Agentforce\u2019s success, which is already being piloted by a few dozen companies like Wiley, Open Table, and Fossil. It hasn\u2019t been all smooth sailing for the program so far. Andreessen Horowitz challenged Salesforce\u2019s ability to create a compelling AI assistant, saying in a July blog post, \u201cWe believe AI will so fundamentally reimagine the core system of record and the sales workflows that no incumbent is safe.\u201d\nSalesforce and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nAI skeptics are bracing themselves for the future of tech assistants. With upwards of $200 billion expected to be invested into AI by 2025, according to Goldman Sachs, some in the industry fear AI will not be able to keep its promise of revolutionizing how people engage with tech, threatening the lofty valuations of many tech startups.\nBeyond a potentially muted moment in the AI hype cycle, firms also have to contend with mounting concerns over privacy and safety.\n\u201cTech companies are putting this deeply flawed tech in the hands of millions of people and allowing AI models access to sensitive information such as their emails, calendars, and private messages,\u201d Melissa Heikkil\u00e4 wrote in the MIT Technology Review last October.\nAfter introducing updates and AI agent features to Copilot last week, Microsoft doubled down on its promise of privacy when using Copilot\u2019s chatbot feature. Jamie Teevan, Microsoft\u2019s chief scientist, said Copilot customers will see greater value in the product once they optimize how to use it. She added the company is keen to avoid the pitfall of a nagging assistant like Clippy when continuing to develop its AI agents. Benioff isn\u2019t convinced.\n\u201cMicrosoft has deceived customers with their AI strategy, they don\u2019t need to DIY it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe build it into our platform, customers shouldn\u2019t be forced to train and retrain their models.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic According to Financial Media.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks.\nOne of the primary growth drivers in the AI industry over the past few years has been the exponential increase in data generation. The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, e-commerce, and various digital platforms has led to an unprecedented surge in data production. This vast amount of data serves as the fuel for AI systems, particularly in the development of machine learning models. Clive Humby, a venture capitalist, emphasized the critical role of data in AI development by famously proclaiming that data is the new oil. The ability to collect, process, and analyze large datasets allows AI algorithms to improve accuracy and deliver more sophisticated outputs.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nTo understand the AI revolution, it is also important to understand advancements in computing power. Moore\u2019s Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a microchip approximately every two years, has played a crucial role in enhancing the processing power available for AI applications - consider companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and their advanced node processing. The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) - like the ones made popular by NVIDIA - has further accelerated AI development by enabling faster computation and more complex model training. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds globally, says that these improvements in hardware have been a game-changer for AI.\nThe availability of massive investments in AI research and startups is also a key growth driver. According to a report by PwC, global investments in AI are expected to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030, with the technology contributing $6.6 trillion to GDP from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from consumption effects. This influx of capital is spurring innovation and the commercialization of AI technologies across various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Prominent hedge fund managers are also taking note. Ken Griffin, the chief of Citadel Investment Group, says that AI is the most transformative technology of our time, and not just another bubble, but a structural shift in the economy.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have explosive growth potential according to financial news outlets.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. The firm has committed to a large capex to fund AI ventures and Wall Street is already starting to see the return on these investments. Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne recently noted the solid quarterly results of the tech giant, highlighting the strong commercial bookings and management comments about positive demand signals. The investor note also underlined the expectation that Azure growth would accelerate in the second half of the year as more AI capacity came online. The analyst detailed that the company remained well positioned to deliver durable top-and-bottom-line growth.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is said to be considering another large investment in AI startup OpenAI. Back in 2023, the tech giant had invested $10 billion in the California-based AI firm. The new funding round is likely to take the valuation of OpenAI to more than $100 billion, with Apple and NVIDIA also considering investments. Reports indicate that Apple could partner with OpenAI to create an offering to rival Google in internet search.\nOverall MSFT ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that could go parabolic according to financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Microsoft and United Arab Emirates-based artificial intelligence company G42 will open two centres in Abu Dhabi to work on \"responsible\" AI initiatives, the companies said on Tuesday.\nThe UAE, led by government-backed firm G42, is striving to become a global leader in AI and is investing heavily in it to diversify away from oil.\nThe push comes amid rising competition in the region as Qatar and Saudi Arabia pitch themselves as potential AI hubs outside the United States, as well as Washington's concerns over deepening ties between China and Gulf states over potential technology transfers to Beijing.\nThe companies said the deal built on their April partnership, under which Microsoft is investing $1.5 billion in the Emirati firm.\nThe first centre will bring together academic researchers and AI practitioners from the private sector to develop and share best practices in responsible AI.\nThe other centre will focus on tasks including developing large language models - computer programs that draw from vast amounts of text to generate responses to queries - for \"underrepresented languages\".\nAbu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42, whose chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE's national security advisor and the president's brother.\nG42 said earlier this year it had divested its investments in China and at the time of the Microsoft partnership, both firms noted that the deal was backed by assurances to the U.S. and UAE governments over security.\nMicrosoft and G42 said on Tuesday the centres will work to ensure \"generative AI models and applications are developed, deployed and used safely.\"\nG42 and its affiliates do not conduct business with any entity listed on a U.S. government list of parties for which Washington maintains restrictions on certain exports, re-exports, or transfers of items, the firms said.\n(Reporting by Federico Maccioni; Editing by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan)\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks.\u00a0Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nStanley Druckenmiller\u00a0is one of the few billionaires who have been bullish on the AI megatrends right from the start. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019d buy just anything AI the market is buying. After making huge profits from his bullish bet on Jensen Huang\u2019s AI chips empire, he started cashing out of the company in the first quarter and by the end of the June quarter, his stake in the company was left at just over 200,000 shares.\nBack in May, Druckenmiller explained why he\u2019s selling the hottest AI stock, saying he\u2019s had a \u201chell of a run\u201d and he now \u201cjust needs a break.\u201d\nHowever, the billionaire said at the time that AI remains underhyped in the long term. Stanley Druckenmiller compared the internet revolution with the current AI boom, saying AI could \u201crhythm\u201d with the internet and the real payoffs will come 4-5 years from now on. The Duquesne Capital founder, who closed his fund for outside investors and turned it into a family officer in 2011, said that the \u201cincremental payoff\u201d of AI investments is coming by the \u201cday.\u201d\nDuring the second quarter, Druckenmiller shook up his portfolio to buy and sell several famous as well as under-the-radar AI stocks. In this article, we will take a look at some of those.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller\u2019s Stake Value: $178,999,000 (-64% From the First Quarter)\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a latest interview with CNBC that a broader rotation from AI infrastructure to AI software will begin in the later part of 2024 and he\u2019s bullish on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) because of this.\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company\u2019s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office\u2019s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year\u2019s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year\u2019s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year\u2019s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year\u2019s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft\u2019s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI \u2013 its suite of AI services \u2013 is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot \u2013 its AI code writing service \u2013 is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio \u2013 its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks.

He said that usually August and September are slow months in the stock market, but during election years the trend shifts to September and October, with markets historically rebounding in November and December once the uncertainty around the election subsides.

During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) closed the latest trading day at $409.44, indicating a -1.85% change from the previous session's end. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 2.12%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 1.51%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 3.26%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the software maker had gained 5.57% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.77% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.78% in that time.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Microsoft in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Microsoft to post earnings of $3.09 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 3.34%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $64.45 billion, up 14.04% from the year-ago period.\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $13.04 per share and revenue of $277.39 billion, indicating changes of +10.51% and +13.16%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% lower. Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note Microsoft's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 32. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 31.63, which means Microsoft is trading at a premium to the group.\nInvestors should also note that MSFT has a PEG ratio of 2.11 right now.

        "Author": "  Sheryl Estrada ",
        "Text": "Good morning. Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella says he\u2019s raising the bar on operational excellence within the company. So, the tech giant has created a new chief operating officer position and hired a Fortune 500 CFO to take on the role.\nCarolina Dybeck Happe is joining Microsoft as EVP and COO and will become a member of the senior leadership team reporting to Nadella. Dybeck Happe was most recently at GE in the role of SVP and CFO from 2020 until September 2023. She remained an SVP at GE for a period of time to assist with the transition.\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to admire Carolina through her work as a global business leader, including most recently her role in leading GE\u2019s historic turnaround,\u201d Nadella said in a blog post on Sept. 12.\nDuring her time at GE, Dybeck Happe worked with GE CEO Larry Culp to dismantle the conglomerate and give it new life. They succeeded in delivering three independent, investment-grade companies\u2014GE HealthCare, GE Vernova (which houses the energy portfolio), and GE Aerospace. \"Under Larry\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ve worked to transform one of the world\u2019s most iconic companies,\" Dybeck Happe said last year.\nNow, she will bring her \u201clifelong passion for technology\u201d and global experience to Microsoft to deliver transformation at scale, Dybeck Happe said in a LinkedIn post last week. \u201cWhen I first spoke with Satya Nadella about Microsoft\u2019s AI transformation, I immediately saw the incredible opportunity for AI to benefit every aspect of its business as a catalyst for innovation, growth, and value creation.\u201d\nThe commerce and ecosystems organizations, the Microsoft Digital IT team, and the Microsoft Business Operations org in the finance department will now all report to Dybeck Happe. As COO, she will most likely collaborate often with longtime Microsoft CFO Amy Hood.\nOver the past decade, about 35% of large companies have utilized a COO position, according to executive search firm Crist Kolder Associates\u2019 mid-year Volatility Report. But in 2022, it reached 39.6%. And in the first half of 2024, about 35.9% of companies have a COO. The findings are based on data from 671 Fortune 500 and S&P 500 companies. The COO role is seemingly making a comeback.\nSome finance chiefs have added on the role of COO to their duties, like Block CFO Amrita Ahuja and Macy\u2019s CFO Adrian Mitchell. And Target CFO Michael Fiddelke will move fully to a COO role, once the company chooses a new finance chief. So, what makes companies look to CFOs to fill chief operating officer jobs?\nA COO\u2019s core job is to ensure \"the trains run efficiently, and one of the truest measurements of efficiency is financial health,\u201d Scott W. Simmons, comanaging partner at Crist Kolder told me. Operational efficiency and financial health go hand in hand, he said.\nAt Microsoft, Dybeck Happe will need to tap into her vast experience to drive continuous business process improvement and accelerate company-wide AI transformation. And all signs indicate that she's ready.\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best Augmented Reality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other augmented reality stocks.\nAugmented reality (AR) is a technology that enhances our perception of the real world by overlaying digital elements through devices, adding to your existing environment. There are various ways to describe AR, from spatial computing to holographic projection, but its practical applications define its true value. A notable example of an AR device is the HoloLens, a holographic computer that enables users to interact with digital content within the real world, leading to its growing adoption across various industries such as education, manufacturing, and healthcare.\nDespite its applications and prospective growth, the AR space seems to have lost favor with venture capitalists, with investments declining due to disappointing adoption rates for the gear and leading metaverse platforms. Even the launch of the Vision Pro headset earlier this year, promoted as a \"spatial computing\" device, didn't significantly shift the mood. Reports suggest that demand for the $3,500 device is cooling, prompting the maker to lower its shipment forecast.\nSimilarly, the investment climate in the startup sector remains cold, with only about $464 million invested this year in seed through growth-stage funding for AR, VR, and metaverse-related companies. This sets 2024 on course to reach the lowest funding total in years. Most startups that raised large financings during the peak in 2021 haven't secured new rounds since. However, despite the slowdown, some notable deals have still occurred, with the largest AR-related round this year going to Rokid, a maker of augmented reality glasses, which raised $70 million in January. Another notable investment was in Beijing-based Xreal, a mixed-reality glasses maker that\u00a0 positions itself as a more affordable alternative to the Quest and Vision Pro, which raised $60 million in January at a $1 billion valuation.\nMost notably, Google recently partnered with augmented reality startup Magic Leap in a strategic technology deal, hinting that the tech giant may be preparing to re-enter the AR and VR market, a space it has mostly left to rivals. Over a decade ago, the search engine giant was a trailblazer in AR. This enthusiasm peaked during a 2012 demo where skydivers used the glasses to live stream a jump onto a building in San Francisco. However, the product faced significant consumer pushback due to its awkward design and privacy concerns.\nThe global augmented reality market, valued at $32.1 billion in 2022, is projected to grow from $42.85 billion in 2023 to $432.35 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% over the forecast period, according to industry data from SkyQuest.\nA significant portion of the market is mobile AR, leveraging the widespread ownership of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. As of this year, it's projected that there will be 1.7 billion devices capable of supporting mobile AR. Notably, a key advantage mobile AR enjoys is the massive existing smartphone user base. Unlike the steep challenges AR glasses face, mobile AR benefits from \"zero-cost\" hardware, making its path to adoption relatively smoother. Growth is expected across both enterprise and consumer segments, including digital AR experiences. A well-known example is the 2016 video game Pok\u00e9mon GO, where players explore their surroundings to find virtual characters on their phones. Additionally, collaborations between key market players and 5G providers to address latency issues are expected to fuel market growth.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we reviewed online rankings and ETFs to determine 20 companies operating in the AR space. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Our focus was on companies that produce AR-related hardware, software, or technologies used in developing augmented reality products. However, we also included companies that offer services essential to the AR industry, like semiconductor chips.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech giant poised to continue advancing its augmented reality offerings and integrating them with its AI technologies. Notably, the company's HoloLens 2 has significant applications in academia and various professional industries. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s rapidly expanding cloud business also provides it with a substantial advantage in scaling the metaverse network. With the recent completion of its acquisition of video game giant Activision Blizzard, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) may also aggressively expand into the social metaverse space.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s revenue grew 15% year-over-year in the fiscal fourth quarter, while net income rose to $22.04 billion, up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the same quarter last year. For the fiscal first quarter, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue between $63.8 billion and $64.8 billion, indicating a 13.8% growth at the midpoint. Notably, revenue from Azure and other cloud services increased by 29% during the quarter.\nAhead of Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Q4 earnings report, UBS analysts had identified three key discussion points: Azure's potential upside from AI and core demand, capital expenditure trends, and the growth trajectory of Office 365. The analysts reiterated a Buy rating and set a $520 price target for MSFT, highlighting the company's significant involvement in AI as a major driver of future growth.\n\u201cCoreWeave\u2019s revs and backlog growth trajectory is outstanding and with Microsoft as a major customer, we view this as a positive for AI infrastructure demand. We\u2019re definitely in a tight IT budget backdrop, but the Azure demand signals are bullish.\u201d\nAdditionally, Piper Sandler raised its price target for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $485 from $465, maintaining an Overweight rating. This adjustment reflects optimism about Microsoft's cloud revenue growth prospects, with the firm's analysis suggesting that the company's cloud revenue could potentially double to over $200 billion by the end of fiscal year 2026.\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Strategy trailed the Russell 3000 Index benchmark largely due to our diversified positioning, although we maintain a considerable portfolio allocation to large cap AI-related companies. These positions were indeed among our top contributors in the quarter, such as\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is finding more ways to deploy AI for sustainability objectives such as its ability to better measure, predict and optimize complex systems, which can help its partner communities reduce wildfire risk.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best augmented reality stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Google said Wednesday that it had filed a complaint against Microsoft at the European Commission, accusing its rival of \"anticompetitive\" licensing practices to force customers to use its cloud service.\nGoogle said Microsoft had exploited business customers' reliance on \"must have\" software products such as Windows Server to compel them to use its Azure cloud platform.\nMicrosoft has made it cost-prohibitive for clients to use Windows Server or other products on rival services, such as Google Cloud or Amazon's AWS, by marking up the price by 400 percent, Google charged.\n\"Microsoft's licensing terms restrict European customers from moving their current Microsoft workloads to competitors' clouds \u2013- despite there being no technical barriers to doing so,\" Google Cloud vice president Amit Zavery said in a blog post co-signed by Google Cloud's Europe region president Tara Brady.\nFor businesses that use rival cloud platforms despite the cost, \"Microsoft introduced additional obstacles over the last few years, such as limiting security patches and creating other interoperability barriers\", Google said.\nAt a news conference, Zavery said Google wanted restrictions removed so that customers could use the cloud platform of their choice.\n\"We believe this regulatory action is the only way to end Microsoft vendor lock-in and for customers to have a choice and create a level playing field for competitors,\" Zavery said.\nGoogle said Microsoft adopted the new licensing terms in 2019.\n\"What Microsoft introduced in 2019 basically created this idea of not allowing choice to customers,\" Zavery said.\nA spokesperson at the European Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, confirmed that the complaint was received, adding that \"We will assess under our standard procedures\".\nThe complaint was filed on Tuesday.\nA Microsoft spokesperson said the company \"settled amicably similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, even after Google hoped they would keep litigating\".\n\"Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission,\" the spokesperson added.\n- Clash of tech titans -\nGoogle and Microsoft have feuded for years over antitrust issues.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella last year testified against Google in a US federal court alleging that its business practices had stymied the rise of rival search engines.\nMicrosoft was also involved in the original complaints in the EU against Google in the 2010s over its search dominance, which resulted in major fines against Google.\nAbout a decade ago, the companies agreed to a truce, but that proved to be only temporary.\nThe European Commission has already opened an investigation into Microsoft's Teams video and messaging app.\nMicrosoft tried to assuage the EU's concerns by untying Teams in Europe before expanding the policy to around the world in April.\nBut in June, the commission indicated that the changes were not enough, saying Microsoft violated EU antitrust rules by bundling Teams with its popular Office suite.\nGoogle and other big US tech firms have come under scrutiny from the European Union, as Brussels has been fighting with the companies for years on issues ranging from data privacy to disinformation.\nGoogle has been hit by a variety of fines totalling more than eight billion euros ($9 billion) over antitrust issues.\nThe company got a reprieve earlier this month, however, as an EU court scrapped a 1.5-billion-euro fine imposed by Brussels against Google over abuse of dominance in online advertising.\ndax/lth/js\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up by 2.1% over the past month. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Microsoft's  ROE in this article.\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:\n33% = US$88b \u00f7 US$268b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.33 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Microsoft has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 15% net income growth seen by Microsoft over the past five years.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Microsoft's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 19% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MSFT worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MSFT is currently mispriced by the market.\nMicrosoft has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 26% (or a retention ratio of 74%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.\nBesides, Microsoft has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 22%. As a result, Microsoft's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 28% for future ROE.\nOn the whole, we feel that Microsoft's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Title": "Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best Stock to Invest in for Medium Term?",
        "Author": "  Vardah Gill ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Invest in for Medium Term. In this article, we will look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the best stocks to invest in for the medium term.\nOn September 18, the Federal Reserve reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%\u20135.00% from 5.25%\u20135.50%. Following the announcement, stocks surged, with the broader market hitting a new intra-day all-time high and closing at its 39th record of 2024, marking the first since mid-July. The index has risen over 20% since the beginning of the year. The interest rate reduction has created new opportunities for investors, signaling a shift towards a more supportive monetary policy intended to boost economic activity. Lower interest rates generally result in reduced borrowing costs, encouraging both business expansion and consumer spending. This fosters a favorable environment, making medium-term investments, typically ranging from 3 to 5 years, more appealing.\nTo effectively execute this strategy, investors should evaluate several key factors in the companies they select. These include the stock\u2019s performance over the past year, profitability, sales figures, debt levels, price-to-earnings ratio, and dividends. Additionally, assessing revenue growth and payout ratios can provide further insights.\nDividend stocks are often seen as good choices for medium-term investments, providing investors with passive income while they hold the stock. In addition, dividend-paying companies can be a smart investment during times of market volatility. A report by Hartford Funds showed that from 1940 to 2023, dividend income contributed an average of 34% to the total return of the broader market. The report also highlighted that in decades with total returns below 10%\u2014such as the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s\u2014dividends made a significant impact on overall returns.\nDividend growth is the most favored approach within dividend investing, as it boosts investors\u2019 income over time. Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, emphasized the significance of dividend growth strategies in investment planning. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\u201cGenerally, it\u2019s larger, more mature companies that return capital to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.\u201d\nA company\u2019s dividend payout ratio is a crucial measure of its ability to maintain dividend flexibility. Firms that allocate most or all of their earnings to dividends may struggle under competitive pressure, as their cash flow might not be enough to sustain operations. A report by Nuveen highlighted that, historically, stocks with the highest payout ratios haven\u2019t delivered the best long-term results. Instead, companies with moderate to moderately high payout ratios have tended to outperform over the past two decades among dividend-paying stocks. With this, we will now discuss some of the best stocks to buy for medium term.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener to to find dividend stocks with an average revenue growth of over 10% over the past five years, highlighting companies with consistent sales growth. From that selection, stocks with a five-year average payout ratio of under 40% were chosen, indicating a strong cash position. The final list includes 7 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\n5-Year Average Annual Revenue Growth Rate: 14.26%\n5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 28.30%\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) tops our list of the best stocks to buy for medium term. The Washington-based multinational technology company is best known for its wide range of innovative software products. The stock has surged by over 18% in 2024 so far because of its strong business momentum. In fiscal Q4 2024, the company generated $64.7 billion in revenues, up 15% from the same period last year. Its net income also showed a 10% YoY growth at $22 billion. The company\u2019s strong performance this fiscal year highlights its innovation and the continued confidence of its customers. As a platform-focused organization, it is committed to meeting critical customer needs through its extensive platforms, while positioning itself as a leader in the AI era.\nThe company\u2019s AI segment was also appreciated by\u00a0Fred Alger Management\u00a0in its Q2 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the firm said:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) declared a 10.7% hike in its quarterly dividend on September 17 to $0.83 per share. This was the company\u2019s 19th consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes it one of the best stocks to buy. As of September 19, the stock supports a dividend yield of 0.68%.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the most popular stocks among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q2 2024. Of the 912 elite money makers in our database, 279 hedge funds owned stakes in the company, worth over $89 billion in total. With nearly 35 million shares,\u00a0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust\u00a0was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q2.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to invest in for medium term. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the companies that's been at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in the tech industry. It has invested billions into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and added AI capabilities to its Office software. And the company is promising to help save business users lots of time with its Copilot virtual assistant, which will help people draft emails, assist with PowerPoint presentations, and create formulas in Excel spreadsheets.\nThose all sound like time-saving features, but whether they're enough to justify paying for a subscription to Copilot is something I've questioned from the start. While they're nice-to-have features, they may not be necessary for businesses, especially when Copilot costs $30 per user per month.\nThere are rumblings that business users aren't impressed with the capabilities. If that's the case, that could be a big problem for the highly valued tech stock.\nMicrosoft launched an office assistant called Clippy, represented by an animated paperclip, back in the '90s but removed it after many users became frustrated with it. Clippy recognized when you were working on a resume or letter and offered to help. While technology has come a long way since then and there's a lot more Copilot and chatbots can do than Clippy, the idea isn't a lot different.\nOne chief executive officer who isn't impressed is Salesforce's Marc Benioff, who says, \"Microsoft Copilot is basically the new Microsoft Clippy.\" Benioff may, of course, be biased, given that his company wants to hype its own AI product, Salesforce Einstein.\nMicrosoft recently rolled out a new wave of features for Copilot to help with collaboration, as well as agents that can help automate tasks. Is there anything there that can prove to be a game changer for a business? It's still debatable.\nUsers can access a lot of the functionality Copilot offers via ChatGPT or other chatbots, and in many cases, a subscription isn't necessary. That's why I'm a bit skeptical about Copilot, even with the launch of new features.\nLast year, Microsoft said it might generate as much as $10 billion in annual AI-related revenue by 2026. Although that's a significant amount of money, investors should also remember that this company brought in more than $245 billion in sales in the trailing 12 months. A $10 billion increase would represent a 4% boost to its top line.\nIn the early innings of AI, it may be easy for Microsoft to generate a lot of growth due to Copilot, but as companies have more time to evaluate it and other AI-related products emerge, that could change. I've used Copilot and have been unimpressed with what it offers. I also think there's some truth in what Benioff is saying --\u00a0 that Copilot may just be another incarnation of Clippy.\nWhile Copilot has greater capabilities than Clippy, it could be difficult for businesses to justify taking on a large annual expenditure on the new features. There's no showstopper that makes Copilot a must-buy for a business.\nMicrosoft is a highly valued stock with a market cap of $3.2 trillion. At more than 36 times trailing earnings, investors are paying a big multiple for a business that may be facing increased competition in the future. Although its sales are still growing, they may not be at a fast enough rate to justify such a high premium for the tech stock.\nIt's too early to say that Copilot will turn out to be a disappointment, but it wouldn't surprise me if that turned out to be the case. This stock has gotten a bit too hot of late. Unless you're willing to buy and hold for several years, you may be better off pursuing more modestly priced growth stocks instead of Microsoft.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Gabriel Araujo ",
        "Text": "By Gabriel Araujo\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Alphabet unit Google has agreed for the first time ever to purchase nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup, its first engagement with carbon projects in the South American country.\nGoogle will buy 50,000 metric tons of carbon removal credits by 2030 from Mombak, which purchases degraded land from farmers and ranchers or partners with them to replant native species in the Amazon rainforest, the firms said on Thursday.\nGoogle, which had previously bought engineered removal credits, follows fellow U.S. tech giant Microsoft, which last year inked a deal to buy up to 1.5 million credits from Mombak.\nThe Brazilian startup and Google did not reveal terms of the deal. In 2023, when it sold credits to McLaren Racing, Mombak priced them at an average of more than $50 per ton.\n\"The vote of confidence for us and this sector in general that comes from Google stepping into this is a really positive signal,\" Mombak's Chief Technology Officer Dan Harburg said in an interview, hoping it would trigger more deals.\nThe announcement comes as companies and authorities gather this month in New York for its annual Climate Week.\nEarlier this week, Facebook owner Meta agreed to buy up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits from Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual's forestry arm.\nGoogle, Microsoft, Meta and Salesforce are the co-founders of the so-called Symbiosis Coalition, which pledges to contract for up to 20 million tons of nature-based carbon removal credits by 2030.\nCarbon offsets allow companies to make up for greenhouse gas emissions by paying for actions to cut emissions elsewhere to meet corporate climate goals. Each credit represents a reduction of one ton of carbon dioxide emissions.\nCritics of carbon offset markets, including Greenpeace, say they allow emitters to keep releasing greenhouse gases.\n(Reporting by Gabriel Araujo; Editing by David Gregorio)\n"

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Palantir vs. Microsoft",
        "Author": "  Chris Neiger, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "An estimated $1 trillion will be invested into expanding artificial intelligence (AI) services over the next several years in everything from graphics processors to software. Many tech companies will benefit from this massive investment, but which will be the best long-term AI stocks to own?\nLet's take a quick look at two key AI players right now -- Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- to see how each one is winning in their respective markets and which one could be the better AI stock for years to come.\nPalantir has spent years creating advanced AI systems that government agencies use to sift through reams of data and make the best decisions. A large chunk of its sales still come from its government contracts -- just over half -- but the company has expanded its AI footprint over the past few years into the commercial sector as well.\nCommercial segment revenue jumped 33% in the second quarter (which ended June 30) and accounted for about 45% of Palantir's total sales. Why does expansion of commercial sales matter for Palantir? Because it proves that the company's AI tech is robust and can be repurposed in a rapidly expanding AI market.\nNot all companies can claim that. Consider what chief technology officer Shyam Sankar said on the company's recent earnings call about its advantage over AI competitors:\u00a0\"[W]here the market is completely bottlenecked is on that transition from prototyping to production. And that happens to be the place that we are most differentiated.\"\nIndeed, while others are playing catch-up, Palantir is already benefiting from years of AI investments. Management estimates U.S. commercial sales will jump 47% in 2024 to $672 million. Leadership also increased its full-year sales guidance to a range of $2.74 billion to $2.75 billion -- up about 23% from last year.\nMicrosoft might not be the most exciting name in AI right now, but it's certainly one of the most important. The company has already invested an estimated $13 billion into ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and its early bet in one of the most influential AI start-ups is already paying off.\nMicrosoft quickly put its investment to work by integrating the underlying ChatGPT tech into its popular suite of Microsoft 365 software products, its GitHub developer platform, and Azure cloud computing services.\nThe biggest AI opportunity from all of this likely comes from Azure. Microsoft has the second-largest cloud computing service by market share (25% right now) after Amazon, and its new AI tools are expanding its reach. Management said on the fourth-quarter earnings call that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, roughly 60% higher than the year-ago quarter.\nWhy does this matter? Because sales in the cloud computing market will grow to an estimated $2 trillion by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. AI is driving some of that growth already, and Microsoft should benefit as more companies look to its AI cloud services to enhance their own AI offerings.\nWhile Palantir has lots of opportunities in the AI market, there are two reasons I think Microsoft's stock is the better option. First, it's far less expensive than Palantir's shares.\nMicrosoft's shares have a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 32 right now. While not exactly inexpensive, it's far less pricey than Palantir's forward P/E of 87.\nSecond, Microsoft's substantial investment in OpenAI and its position in the cloud computing market mean that the company has access to some of the most advanced AI available right now and an expanding market to implement it.\nWith its cheaper price tag and a massive AI cloud market to benefit from, Microsoft is now likely a better long-term AI play than Palantir.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of\u00a0 AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

The stock has gained over the past few days after the company announced plans to partner with tech giant Microsoft to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear site in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has reportedly written a letter asking grid operator PJM Interconnection to allow the Three Mile Island reactor to be allowed to come online as quickly as possible rather than waiting in the queue as if they were an entirely new development. PJM's queue for new electricity generation projects has been shut down to new applications since 2021 and is not expected to reopen until 2026, and once it reopens, it is unlikely to be able to approve some new projects for years, Shapiro said.\nIn response to the new developments, Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro has raises his price target for Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stock to $313 from $233 while reiterating an Outperform rating, saying in a research note that the company's 20-year contract with Microsoft proves out the value of nuclear power for hyperscalers, with higher prices possible for future deals.\nOverall CEG ranks 8th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 13, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.\nNVIDIA Corporation\u2019s meteoric rise in the last few years due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) came to a screeching halt last week after the company was plagued with antitrust issues.\nHowever, the possibility of a new U.S.-Saudi Arabia deal related to NVIDIA\u2019s chips and encouraging comments on Blackwell chip production by CEO Jensen Huang lifted the semiconductor giant\u2019s stock on Wednesday\u2019s trading session by 8.2%.\nBut can NVIDIA\u2019s share price scale upward for the rest of the year and beyond? Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nOn Wednesday, Semafor, citing credible sources, stated that the U.S. government is considering allowing NVIDIA to export its advanced chips to Saudi Arabia, which would help the Middle Eastern nation run sophisticated AI models. At Saudi Arabia\u2019s global AI summit, attendees discussed accessing NVIDIA\u2019s H200 chips, initially used in OpenAI's GPT-4o, a multimodal transformer.\nIf the restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors are lifted, NVIDIA\u2019s revenues will surge due to the heightened demand in Saudi Arabia. NVIDIA is making the most of the rise in global semiconductor sales, which hit $51.3 billion in July, up 18.7% year over year, per the Semiconductor Industry Association.\nAt a technology conference hosted by Goldman Sachs on Wednesday, Huang said that NVIDIA has ramped up manufacturing of the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips. Shipping of these high-end chips will begin in significant numbers in the fourth quarter to cater to high demand.\nMicrosoft Corp., and others have ordered the Blackwell chips in large numbers worth billions of dollars, while Amazon.com, Inc. is contemplating moving from Hopper to Blackwell as it has more AI throughput.\nThe new Blackwell\u2019s NVLink will offer high-speed communication, while its graphic processing unit (GPU) will have more power. The NVIDIA CEO also confirmed they will move to other fabrications if required and reduce dependency on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited to develop the chip designs.\nHuang recently said that a huge chunk of data would be transferred from the central processing units to GPUs, a blessing for NVIDIA since the chip giant has more than 80% share in the GPU market, which is estimated to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion in 2024, at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.\nNVIDIA\u2019s dominance in the GPU market propelled the company\u2019s revenues from the data center GPU business to $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. In comparison, NVIDIA\u2019s arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s revenues from the data center business grew 115% to only $2.8 billion.\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs enjoy a wide competitive moat because of the dependency that developers have on the CUDA software platform. Unlike CUDA, AMD\u2019s software platform, ROCm isn\u2019t considered to be very efficient.\nNVIDIA is also benefiting from the growing interest in AI, as GPUs are an integral part of the computer server infrastructure needed to train large language models and operate AI interfaces. NVIDIA\u2019s H100 graphic cards are the most sought-after in the AI chip market. The AI industry is projected to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030, according to Markets and Markets.\nThe likely ease in restrictions on the sale of chips to Saudi Arabia, Blackwell production heating up, and the clear lead in the GPU space would boost NVIDIA\u2019s shares in the near future.\nNotable brokers, hence, have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 38.1% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $108.10. The highest price target set by the analysts is $200, signifying an upside of 85%.\nAdditionally, so far this year, NVIDIA\u2019s shares have traded above the 200-day moving average, which is indicative of a prolonged uptrend.\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News That Broke The Internet This Week.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this week.\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming indispensable for large businesses, providing them with tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug\u200b.\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company\u2019s total sales\u200b. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure\u200b. The company\u2019s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. It has invested heavily in AI as it seeks to keep pace with new developments in the tech business. As part of these investments, the firm contributed $10 billion to a funding round for OpenAI, the California-based firm that launched the AI wave with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. The startup is rumored to be valued at above $100 billion if the latest funding round, led by Microsoft, Apple, and NVIDIA, is successful. At the startup, developers are reportedly working on a next-level artificial intelligence product, dubbed Strawberry, which is capable of solving advanced problems and tasks.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) hopes for the launch of the new product before the end of this year. Reports indicate that Strawberry is capable of solving math problems it has never encountered, something current AI models, such as ChatGPT, are incapable of - firmly putting the former in the generative AI basket. The product is also capable of performing high-level tasks, such as developing marketing strategies and solving complex word puzzles.\nOverall MSFT ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Is It Too Late To Consider Buying Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$468 and falling to the lows of US$395. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$414 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Microsoft\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nGreat news for investors \u2013 Microsoft is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $570.58, but it is currently trading at US$414 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Microsoft\u2019s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Microsoft's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 51%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? Since MSFT is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on MSFT for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy MSFT. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Microsoft, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\nIf you are no longer interested in Microsoft, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "A Wall Street Analyst Just Downgraded Microsoft. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "Author": "  Bram Berkowitz, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), a \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that saw its stock rise more than 200% over the last five years, recently experienced something pretty rare for a company of its stature: a downgrade from a Wall Street analyst. Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, recently cut his rating on the tech conglomerate from \"buy\" to \"neutral.\" Luria maintained his $475 price target for the company, which still implies upside from the current price. Of the 59 analysts covering Microsoft, 55 rate the stock as a buy and three as a hold.\nShould investors be worried about this recent downgrade? Let's take a look.\nLuria's downgrade is predicated on the idea that Microsoft may have lost its edge on the artificial intelligence front, which will continue to be a critical catalyst for large tech stocks.\nLast year, Microsoft was all the rage when it came to AI. The company integrated OpenAI's capabilities into its Azure platform to allow developers to build new applications that could automate tasks and leverage massive amounts of data. The company also launched its own generative AI-powered platform called Microsoft Copilot and integrated it with other classic applications like Microsoft Teams, where it can accomplish tasks such as creating overviews and transcripts of meetings.\nHowever, this lead may be dissipating, according to Luria, who said that Alphabet's Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services are now adding business at a similar clip. Furthermore, Luria said he thinks that Google and Amazon are doing a better job of investing in their own in-house chips than Microsoft, giving those companies a potential cost advantage. Investors are still baking in a premium valuation for Microsoft based on this perceived AI lead, Luria said.\nEven with the possibility that Microsoft is losing its edge in the AI realm, Microsoft has still developed one of the best businesses in the world and is a company that the broader business world depends on to run its day-to-day operations.\nMicrosoft operates several businesses that provide good revenue diversity within the tech sector. The company's powerhouse revenue generators include its server products and cloud services capabilities that people can build and manage applications on, as well as its suite of office products that businesses use to accomplish daily tasks. The company has also seen strong growth in recent years in gaming, largely due to the Xbox console, and social media thanks to LinkedIn.\nThe financials remain compelling. In fiscal-year 2024, Microsoft grew diluted earnings per share by 20% year over year, with revenue up 16%. The company has recently been generating operating margins in the mid-40s percentile with annual free cash flow of more than $74 billion in 2024. This allows the company to return a lot of capital to shareholders. Recently, Microsoft announced a new share repurchase program that allows the company to buy back up to $60 billion of stock.\nI think Luria certainly brings up some interesting points that investors should pay attention to. Microsoft also trades at close to 33 times forward earnings, so a disappointing earnings season or further evidence of struggles in the AI battle could make the stock susceptible to a pullback in the near term.\nBut long term, Microsoft still offers one of the most enviable moats in the world. And if the company is truly struggling with its AI capabilities, it has the resources to right the ship, so I think long-term investors can continue to hold the stock without too much concern.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $743,952!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers ",
        "Text": "Microsoft has launched its answer to Google\u2019s AI-powered search experiences: Bing generative search.\nOn the heels of a pilot in July, Bing generative search \u2014 albeit still under development \u2014 began rolling out to all U.S. users this morning. The easiest way to invoke it is by searching \"Bing generative search\" on Bing; Microsoft also said it is introducing an option to more easily trigger Bing generative search for \"informational queries.\"\nUnderpinned by a mix of AI models, Bing generative search aggregates information from around the web to generate a summary in response to search queries. For example, when a user searches \u201cWhat's a spaghetti western?\u201d Bing generative search will show a summary of the genre's history and examples, along with links to sources.\nAs with Google\u2019s similar AI Overviews feature, there\u2019s an option to dismiss AI-generated summaries for traditional search results from the search page.\nBing generative search does more than just find an answer. \"It understands the search query, reviews millions of sources of information, dynamically matches content, and generates search results in a new AI-generated layout to fulfill the intent of the user\u2019s query more effectively,\" Microsoft wrote in a blog post.\nMicrosoft insists that Bing generative search, which evolves the AI-generated chat answers it launched on Bing in February 2023, fulfills the intent of users\u2019 queries more reliably. But much has been written about AI-generated search results going wrong.\nGoogle\u2019s AI Overviews infamously suggested putting glue on a pizza. Arc Search told one reporter that cut-off toes will eventually grow back. Genspark recommends a few weapons that might be used to kill someone. And Perplexity ripped off articles written by outlets such as CNBC, Bloomberg, and Forbes without giving credit or attribution.\nAI-generated overviews threaten to cannibalize traffic to the sites from which they source their information. Indeed, they already are, with one study finding that Google's AI Overviews could negatively affect about 25% of publisher traffic because Overviews de-emphasizes article links.\nMicrosoft promised in July that it would \"look closely at how generative search impacts traffic to publishers,\" and said that it had preliminary data that Bing generative search \"[maintained] the number of clicks to websites.\" But the company shared no new information on that research today.\nOf course, any changes to the Bing experience are guaranteed to be less impactful than Google's moves, given Google's enormous search market advantage. According to Statista, Google had an 81.95% share of the global search market as of September 2024 versus Bing's 10.51%.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/microsoft-brings-ai-powered-overviews-to-bing/\n"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Uber Technologies UBER.\nAlphabet has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), search engines and autonomous driving technology, which, in turn, is instilling investor optimism in its stock. With a 16.5% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Alphabet has outperformed the Zacks Internet-Services industry\u2019s return of 14.3%.\nHowever, the GOOGL stock has lagged behind the broader technology sector\u2019s rally of 23.4% and the S&P 500 index\u2019s gain of 20% in the same time frame.\nAlphabet has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in generative AI (GenAI) technology. Its growing GenAI capabilities are driving its momentum in the booming cloud computing market and the search engine space by enhancing search results.\nThe company is also riding on its strength in YouTube and its dominant position in the search engine market, which are playing a vital role in shaping the growth trajectory of its advertisement business.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding footprint in the self-driving vehicle space on the back of Waymo is another major positive.\nHowever, increasing investment expenses, litigation issues associated with data privacy and its AI technology, and market uncertainties are concerning for GOOGL.\nAlso, Alphabet faces significant competition in the booming GenAI market from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, which are leaving no stone unturned to boost their GenAI-powered offerings.\nAlthough Alphabet enjoys a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space, it faces rising competition from the likes of Amazon, Baidu, General Motors and Tesla.\nStiff competition poses a risk to GOOGL\u2019s market position.\nGiven the combination of both risks and rewards, investors should consider the fact that how these AI, search and autonomous driving initiatives poise Alphabet well for growth opportunities in the long run.\nGOOGL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nAlphabet is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.32X compared with the industry\u2019s 5.34X, which suggests that investors should wait for a better entry point.\nAlphabet\u2019s division Google is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLM) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini.\nGemini comes in four sizes, forming a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything, from data centers to devices. Each model of this family is designed for various use cases. With Gemini, Google offers the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date.\nThe company offers an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist, which is driving its momentum among various enterprises.\nSolid momentum in Google\u2019s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive. The launch of the latest image generation model, namely Imagen 3, in preview for Vertex AI customers with early access, is a plus.\nGoogle\u2019s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is another positive.\nGoogle offers Gemma 2, which belongs to its family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models called Gemma, to researchers and developers across the globe. It is available in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes.\nIts unveiling of LearnLM, a family of GenAI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects, is noteworthy.\nGoogle\u2019s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are driving traffic on its search platform.\nThe integration of GenAI technology into the search engine is benefiting Google Search. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are continuously improving the search results.\nThe introduction of Search Generative Experience (\u201cSGE\u201d), which leverages GenAI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is noteworthy.\nThe company\u2019s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus.\nComing to the advertisement business, Alphabet\u2019s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are major positives.\nSGE is aiding the performance of GOOGL\u2019s advertisement business by helping in the creation of relevant, customized and high-quality ads. The strength in the conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is driving the company\u2019s momentum among advertisers. The improving performance of YouTube ads is another positive.\nThis apart, the strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is a tailwind. Google\u2019s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are positive.\nAlphabet is well-poised to penetrate the booming autonomous driving space rapidly on the back of its strong efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.\nWaymo\u2019s strong operations in Phoenix, AZ, are a major positive.\nThe company\u2019s multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter\u2019s customers in Phoenix, AZ, is noteworthy. This deal is in sync with the company\u2019s deepening focus in Phoenix.\nThe company also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.\nApart from Phoenix, Alphabet made Waymo One available to everyone in San Francisco. This move marks Waymo\u2019s very first such expansion outside of Phoenix.\nWaymo received regulatory approval to expand in Los Angeles. It is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.\nAdditionally, the company is testing self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared the fourth city for Waymo One last year.\nWaymo recently expanded its partnership with Uber to introduce the Waymo One experience in Austin and Atlanta via the Uber app. The service will begin in the early 2025.\nAlphabet\u2019s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from its growing GenAI innovations and product integrations. The company\u2019s strength in search and YouTube, which are driving its advertisement revenues, is a positive. Also, its growing momentum in Waymo is a plus. All these factors are expected to drive its top-line growth in the long run.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $292.3 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 14%.\nThe same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.63 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31.6%. The EPS estimate has moved north by a penny over the past 60 days.\nIn this data-driven world, wherein AI has become mainstream for most businesses, Alphabet\u2019s growing GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Moreover, the company\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market and first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space are major positives.\nHowever, growing litigation issues related to privacy concerns and AI technology, along with intensifying competition in both AI and autonomous driving fields, do not bode well for the stock.\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Microsoft vs. Oracle",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The cloud infrastructure market got a nice boost over the past two years thanks to the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Companies across the globe have been using cloud services to train AI models for their specific purposes.\nThe massive demand for AI in the cloud is the reason Goldman Sachs expects the global cloud infrastructure market to clock $2 trillion in revenue in 2030 as compared to $496 billion last year. The investment bank forecasts that generative AI alone could drive $200 billion to $300 billion in annual cloud spending by the end of the decade.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) are two companies trying to make the most of this huge cloud infrastructure opportunity. But which one of these two cloud-focused AI stocks should you consider buying right now? Let's find out.\nMicrosoft was one of the early movers in the AI market thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. That partnership helped the company quickly integrate AI-focused tools into several of its products such as the Azure Cloud, the Windows operating system, and the Microsoft 365 office productivity and collaboration tools.\nThe company's AI-specific services gained impressive traction. For example, its generative AI assistant, Microsoft Copilot, saw healthy demand growth in multiple areas. On the July earnings conference call, CEO Satya Nadella said that its Copilot for the developer platform GitHub is being widely deployed by enterprise customers, with more than 77,000 having chosen it, up 180% year over year. Nadella added that Copilot accounted for more than 40% of GitHub's revenue growth in fiscal 2024 (which ended June 30). Microsoft's Power Platform, which allows customers to build apps embedded with AI, had 45% sequential growth in the previous quarter. Copilot for Microsoft 365, which is the company's cloud-based suite of productivity and collaboration tools, saw a 60% sequential increase in its customer base last quarter.\nInvestment banking firm Piper Sandler estimates that Microsoft 365 Copilot alone could generate $10 billion in annual revenue for the company by 2026. More importantly, Copilot could unlock a terrific long-term opportunity as the market for intelligent virtual assistants is expected to grow 27% annually through 2032, generating almost $100 billion in revenue that year as compared to last year's $10 billion.\nAI also boosted Microsoft's cloud computing business. The company reported 60,000 customers using its Azure AI cloud service last quarter, up 60% from the prior-year period, with the average spending per customer increasing.\nAs a result, Azure revenue increased 30% year over year last quarter (in constant-currency terms), and 8 percentage points of that growth was attributable to AI services. Microsoft is the second-largest provider of cloud infrastructure services with a market share of 20%, so its cloud business should benefit from the adoption of AI services.\nMicrosoft is making the most of the lucrative cloud AI market thanks to its presence in multiple applications. Analysts expect revenue growth to remain solid over the next three fiscal years following a 16% jump in fiscal 2024 to $245 billion.\nBut is it a better investment than Oracle?\nOracle has burst onto the AI scene of late, with customers using its cloud infrastructure to train AI models. Cloud infrastructure revenue shot up 45% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Aug. 31, 2024) to $2.2 billion, outpacing the 7% growth in the company's overall revenue to $13.3 billion.\nOracle's cloud infrastructure-as-a-service business expects impressive and prolonged growth for two reasons. First, the infrastructure-as-a-service market is forecast to hit $580 billion by 2030, accounting for a major chunk of overall cloud spending. Second, Oracle is going all out to increase its capacity as the demand for its cloud infrastructure is outpacing supply.\nThe remaining performance obligations (RPO) of its cloud business shot up 80% year over year last quarter. RPO is the total value of a company's contracts that are yet to be fulfilled, and overall RPO jumped 52% year over year in the fiscal 2025 first quarter to $99 billion.\nOracle is on track to double its capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to $15 billion. The aim is to allow the company to serve the additional AI-related demand. Management expects revenue to grow by 10% in fiscal 2025 to $58 billion. Prior projections had growth pegged at 7%.\nManagement believes the company could achieve 12% revenue growth in fiscal 2026 to $65 billion as it converts more of its RPO into revenue. It has also updated its long-term forecasts and expects its top line to grow to at least $104 billion in fiscal 2029, along with annual earnings growth of over 20% over the next five years.\nThis is where the company enjoys an advantage over Microsoft, whose earnings are forecast to increase at an annual rate of just under 15% for the next five years.\nMicrosoft and Oracle are top cloud computing stocks that benefit from the proliferation of AI services in the cloud. Microsoft is growing faster than Oracle right now. At the same time, Oracle's solid revenue pipeline is why its pace of growth is expected to top Microsoft's in the future.\nAs such, it boils down to the valuation of the two companies to determine which is a better AI play right now. The following chart tells us that Microsoft is the cheaper of the two stocks when we compare their trailing price-to-earnings ratios (P/E). However, Oracle's forward earnings multiple is much lower than Microsoft's and points toward a stronger jump in earnings.\nAlso, Oracle is undervalued looking at the price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of the two companies.\nThe PEG ratio is a forward-looking valuation metric that considers the potential earnings growth that a company is likely to deliver. A reading of less than 1 indicates that a stock is undervalued with respect to its growth forecast, which is the reason investors looking to add an AI stock that could capitalize on the lucrative cloud computing market might be tempted to buy Oracle over Microsoft.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $760,130!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News You Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The ability of generative AI to handle complex tasks like legal document drafting and even medical diagnoses has led experts to view it as a game-changer across industries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nBig Tech CEOs are hyper-focused on AI development right now.

Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai has stressed the importance of setting up responsible AI development, remarking that the potential of AI is immense, and noting that it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. Andy Jassy has claimed that with cloud cost optimization programs largely in the rearview, companies are now turning their attention to investments in generative AI that is already a multi-billion-dollar business.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a010 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI news that has not received significant media coverage but is important to the AI market nonetheless.

The project is indicative of the growing power demand of AI data centers and also highlights the AI ambitions of Microsoft. Under the terms of the partnership, Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) will revive the nuclear power plant in the area which closed down in 2019.

A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies \u2014 especially generative AI \u2014 has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes.

According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

        "Text": "Microsoft was among the hot stocks on Yahoo Finance's Trending Tickers page after D.A. Davidson downgraded the tech giant. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) competition among big tech companies.\nLuria tells Yahoo Finance that Microsoft (MSFT) \"had a big head start because they were involved with OpenAI for a long time. They knew ChatGPT was coming before everybody else. They knew that they were going to commercialize it. So about a year and a half ago, they came out with a whole set of commercial products around AI that gave them a big lead over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) who were both caught flat-footed.\u201d\n\u201cSince then, Amazon and Google, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)], respectively, have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think that you can start telling that they've caught up, both in terms of the results they've reported and the conversations we're having with industry participants tell us that their capabilities are now comparable to Azure's, thus diminishing the lead.\u201d\n\u201cGoing forward, we think AWS and GCP have an advantage over Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU, something that Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cMicrosoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia's (NVDA) shareholders. Their over-investment right now creates a point of margin headwind every year they over-invest, meaning Microsoft has to lay off 10,000 people just to keep its margins flat because of how much it's over-investing in building this infrastructure, using the most expensive chips, which are Nvidia GPUs.\u201d\n\u201cI'd say we're just at a point where they both [Nvidia and Microsoft] can't both win. Either Microsoft continues to over-invest in Nvidia GPUs, in which case Nvidia wins, but Microsoft has diminishing margins, or it slows down that rate of investment.\u201d\nHe says \u201cthe cooling down of investment\u201d could lead him to change his view on Microsoft. \u201cIf they go back to a steady state of investment and expand data centers, but not at this exponential rate, that would take away that margin and headwind and position Microsoft for much faster earnings growth... if Microsoft actually cools off its investment, margins will grow, and they won't really sacrifice any revenue growth.\u201d\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n"

Analysts have said the outage also exposed risks of dependence on a single vendor providing a one-stop shop for security solutions.\nMicrosoft executive David Weston told the summit that the \"Windows security ecosystem must come together to innovate a safer and more reliable world,\" according to a Microsoft post on X.\nDelta Air Lines has said it was pursuing legal claims against CrowdStrike and Microsoft, after the outage caused mass flight cancellations and cost the carrier at least $500 million.\n(Reporting by Chris Sanders and Raphael Satter; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n"

Other clients include Honeywell International Inc. and financial services firm Finastra Group Holdings Ltd. Microsoft said Copilot customers increased by more than 60% in the most recent quarter, compared with the previous period, while the number of clients with more than 10,000 users doubled. The company didn\u2019t disclose overall customer totals.\nMicrosoft has been infusing its product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI and is touting the new features as a second wave of business-oriented Copilots, AI tools designed to turbocharge programs like Teams conferencing software, Word and Outlook, among other applications.\nConnecting popular Office software to AI models from OpenAI helps differentiate Microsoft\u2019s products from rival offerings, including OpenAI\u2019s own. OpenAI last week released a new model, called o1, that can perform some human-like reasoning tasks, and Microsoft said Monday that it would integrate the technology in its own products at some point.\nMicrosoft has cited strong demand for the earlier versions of the products, and customers praise some of their capabilities, especially the ability to summarize meetings and documents. The Copilots cost $30 a month per user and could one day become a major new revenue stream.\nBut many features remain a work in progress \u2014 generating new content has been more unreliable and the same is true of using the AI tools for things like spreadsheets or tasks that require understanding context. In recent months, skittish investors have signaled impatience with tech companies\u2019 efforts to profit from their massive investments in AI.\nMicrosoft is also rolling out a new feature for Copilot\u2019s chat application called Pages, which gives coworkers a space to work together using data they create and as well as content generated by the AI software. Pages saves the AI-generated material in one place and lets workers edit and share it with other employees. The new feature is being released Monday and will be widely available later this month. \u201cYou can ideate with AI and collaborate with other people,\u201d said Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella.\nMicrosoft is also widely releasing its Copilot tools for the Excel spreadsheet app, which will help users create charts and pivot tables. The Excel Copilot can also work with text data and use the Python programming language for things like forecasts and risk analysis. The Python features, in preview now, are accessible using regular language instead of programming code.\nThe software giant announced new AI features for Word, Teams and PowerPoint. A new Prioritize My Inbox option in Outlook analyzes a user\u2019s messages based on what emails they respond to and who they report to in the office in order to help declutter. The program, which will be available to preview late this year, also summarizes the messages and explains why they\u2019ve been prioritized.\n(Updated with timing of new Pages feature.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 6, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Intuit INTU and Microsoft MSFT.\nIntuit stock has fallen out of favor with investors in 2024 amid fears surrounding AI and the IRS' new free online tax prep system. INTU shares are flat in 2024, lagging the Zacks Tech sector's 16% climb.\nDespite the recent underperformance, Intuit has more than doubled Tech over the past decade and it's projected to post solid double-digit sales and earnings growth going forward. Intuit stock could be ready to break out to all-time highs after getting rejected at its 2021 peaks multiple times this year.\nIntuit's TurboTax software helped transform INTU into a technology powerhouse with a $174 billion market cap that posts consistent double-digit sales and earnings growth. Taxes will be with mankind forever and a government-backed tax prep offering from the IRS hardly seems like a viable long-term Intuit competitor.\nIntuit utilized the Covid boom to expand its software portfolio into other areas of consumer finance, email marketing, digital-ad services, and more. Intuit now boasts roughly 100 million customers across TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp.\nTurboTax is the most recognizable and consumer-facing part of its business. But Intuit's wider consumer unit includes Credit Karma's personal finance services such as credit cards, personal loans, home and auto loans, and insurance.\nIntuit's offerings such as QuickBooks serve small businesses and self-employed people around the world via financial and business-management services, payroll solutions, merchant payment-processing solutions, financing, and more.\nIntuit in early July proved to Wall Street it's going all-in on artificial intelligence. INTU said it would cut 1,800 jobs (10% of its workforce) and hire roughly 1,800 new people \"primarily in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles\" to pursue AI-driven expansion.\nIntuit expects its increased AI investments will make it more attractive to mid-market customers and boost its international reach, among other benefits.\nINTU boosted its Small Business and Self-Employed Group sales by 19% in fiscal 2024, with Online Ecosystem revenue 20% higher. Intuit grew its total revenue by 13% in FY24 (ended July 31) as part of 16% average sales growth during the past nine years.\nIntuit is projected to grow its revenue by 12% in both FY25 and FY26 to reach $20.46 billion vs. $16.29 billion in FY24. Intuit's consistent top-line expansion is up there with the likes of Microsoft and others.\nIntuit grew its adjusted FY24 EPS by 18% and lifted its guidance on August 22. On the bottom line, Inuit is projected to grow its adjusted EPS by 14% both years. INTU's FY25 and FY26 estimates have edged slightly higher since its Q4 release.\nIntuit shares have soared 650% in the past 10 years to crush Tech's 275%. INTU's 2,100% run during the last 15 years helps it blow away Microsoft and nearly quadruple Tech.\nINTU has lagged just behind Tech during the trailing three years, with Intuit stock flat YTD vs. the Tech sector's 16% climb.\nIntuit is far from a value stock, trading at 43.8X forward 12-month earnings compared to Tech's 25.3X. But Wall Street has been paying up for INTU's consistent expansion for 10 years. INTU trades at a 48% discount to its 10-year highs and near its median.\nIntuit has been rejected near its 2021 peaks multiple times in 2024. The stock trades roughly 10% below its highs and 17% beneath its average Zacks price target. INTU is also finding support near its 21-week moving average while trading at neutral RSI levels.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been an early winner of the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). The company was an early investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and moved quickly to capitalize on the breakout capabilities of generative AI.\nThe fruit of those efforts is Copilot, Microsoft's suite of AI-powered digital assistants, and its user base has been growing like wildfire. The company recently reported that \"60% of the Fortune 500 have adopted Copilots, and 65% use Azure OpenAI Service.\" This seems to suggest that Copilot has been wildly successful -- but not everyone is convinced.\nAt the Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) Dreamforce annual user conference this week, CEO Marc Benioff had a few choice words about Microsoft's flagship AI assistant: \"Microsoft Copilot is basically the new Microsoft Clippy, that customers have not gotten value from.\" Regarding the recent rush to develop the large language models (LLMs) that underlie generative AI, \"This is like we're selling science projects to companies, and they're tired of it.\"\nBenioff is referring to the widely disparaged animated paperclip Microsoft unveiled as part of Office 96. The \"smart\" digital helper was designed to assist with certain tasks, but it was viewed more as an annoyance and reviled by users. As such, Benioff's comments had a tone of mockery.\nThese comments came as Benioff was touting the utility of the Salesforce Agentforce, its own suite of AI \"agents\" designed to help employees be more productive by streamlining tasks in service, sales, commerce, and marketing, \"driving unprecedented efficiency.\" If that sounds a lot like what Copilot does, that's because it is.\nSo what does this mean for Microsoft investors? In a word: nothing. It's clear that Benioff has an ulterior motive for promoting Salesforce's own AI tools.\nHis disparaging comments notwithstanding, customers continue to adopt Copilot at a brisk pace, and Microsoft has a laundry list of testimonials from users detailing how they use Copilot to save time and money. Salesforce still needs to prove the value of its offering.\nOh, and at 37 times earnings, Microsoft stock is cheaper.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $710,860!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best Stock To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness?",
        "Author": "  Daniyal Jawaid ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0and\u00a0Seth Klarman\u00a0focus on value, and others like\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0focus on growth, Asness\u2019 fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock\u2019s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock\u2019s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock\u2019s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital\u2019s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\nThese\u00a0returns\u00a0ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\nLooking at the\u00a0returns\u00a0for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are\u00a0plotted\u00a0over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund\u2019s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return\u2019s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022\u00a0according\u00a0to Bloomberg,\nAQR\u2019s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR\u2019s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey\u2019s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund\u2019s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as\u00a0Citadel Wellington,\u00a0Point72, and\u00a0Millennium\u00a05.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness\u2019 top stock picks, it\u2019s also important to see how his firms\u2019 funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed\u2019s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% \u2013 3.50% by 2025 end.\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR\u2019s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index\u2019s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark\u2019s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks \u201cconsidered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe\u201d has been the way to go so far in 2024.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital\u2019s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey\u2019s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 279\nAQR Funds\u2019 Latest Investment Stake: $1.729 billion\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global leader in personal and cloud computing. It dominates these markets via its Windows operating system, which is the most widely used worldwide, and its Azure cloud business division. After Amazon AWS, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second biggest cloud computing company in the world as it commands a 23% market share. This is key for a cloud company, as it enables stable industry partnerships that allow for recurring revenue. Additionally, the scale of Azure, as evidenced by $28.5 billion of Intelligent Cloud revenue means that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s hypothesis is geared more towards cost control (an internal affair) as opposed to growth (which is dependent on external factors). The firm is also one of the industry leaders in AI through its partnership with OpenAI which has allowed Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to provide AI services to its Azure customers. Yet, this also means that moving forward, its ability to generate AI profits is key as the firm has invested billions into the technology.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) chief Satya Nadella is quite optimistic about SaaS, cloud, and AI. Here\u2019s what he shared during the\u00a0Q4 2024 earnings call:\n\u201cSo to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a newer offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that\u2019s faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That\u2019s, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter-over-quarter that is growing 60%, right? That\u2019s a pretty good healthy sign. The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled, right? It\u2019s 2x quarter-over-quarter. That, to me, is a healthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared around Dynamic. That\u2019s another exciting place for us, which is one, we are gaining share. We are \u2013 Dynamics with the GenAI built-in is sort of really biz app, it\u2019s probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI. Contact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I think we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving you that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter. One of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn\u2019t sit on its own, right? So it\u2019s just for \u2013 we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That\u2019s very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that\u2019s, I think, how we think about it at least when I look at what\u2019s happening on our demand side.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list. While we acknowledge MSFT's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 11, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights AT&T T, Altria MO, Nvidia NVDA, Oracle ORCL and Microsoft MSFT.\nWall Street is complex, constantly changing, and challenging to predict. For these reasons, savvy investors understand that striving to lay out the bull and bear cases in a sober, unbiased fashion is important. However, simply laying out the bull and bear case is far from a panacea, and some of the best and brightest investors understand the power of flexibility:\n\u201cYou adapt, evolve, compete, or die.\u201d~ Paul Tudor Jones\n\u201cYou always need to be flexible, bending like a tree in the wind.\u201d ~William O\u2019Neil\n\u201cI change my mind a lot. I can be in love with something on Friday and short it on Wednesday.\u201d~ Stanley Druckenmiller\nToday\u2019s commentary will analyze five critical data points in the current market with an \u201cif, then\u201d mindset.\nThe Federal Reserve and monetary policy laid out by Chairman Jerome Powell is an integral market piece to understand. The Fed\u2019s policy drives liquidity, and liquidity drives equities. Powell recently confirmed that the Fed will cut rates this month.\nThe first rate cut after a hiking cycle is typically bullish for equities. The Fed has cut interest rates 14 times since 1929. Of the 14 rate cuts, 12 instances resulted in the S&P 500 Index being higher a year after the first rate cut.\nHowever, the data says that investors should be concerned if the Fed shows panic and starts a rate cutting cycle with a .50% cut rather than a .25% cut. In both years the market was lower one year after the first cut (2001,2007), the Fed started with a 50bps cut.\nThough the jobs market is showing signs of softening, the CME FedWatch Tool gives the odds of a .25% rate cut at 71% and a .5% cut at only 29%.\nThough value stocks like AT&T and Altria have outperformed recently, theNasdaq 100 ETFand big tech stocks like Nvidia, Oracle and Microsoft have led the market.Because of this, market technicians should focus on QQQ.QQQ has held the 200-day moving average or the 40-week MA since March 2023. The analysis is simple: if QQQ continues to tend above the line it is bullish; below the line is bearish.\nAccording to InvesTech Research, the average bull market since the early 1930s has lasted nearly four years. Considering that the last bear market ended in late 2022, U.S. equities have ample runway into 2026 based on this metric.\nThe Volatility Index (VIX) is a fear gauge that displays Wall Street\u2019s expectations for market turmoil. Spikes above $60 are very extreme and have only occurred three times in the past 30 years: October 2008 during The Global Financial Crisis, March 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the beginning of last month when the \u201cYen Carry\u201d unwound.\nIn each spike above $60, stocks staged generational bottoms and were much higher a year later.\nMarkets have retreated for four straight Decembers.\nThis September is no different. Nevertheless, September weakness has not led to a major correction in the past few years. In 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the S&P 500 Index finished the year higher than the start of September.\nInvestors should be flexible and keep an open mind about the market. Current metrics favor a continued bull market, but savvy investors prepare for either outcome.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Microsoft taps Three Mile Island nuclear plant to power AI",
        "Author": "  Rebecca Bellan ",
        "Text": "The data centers that train the large language models behind AI consume unimaginable amounts of energy, and the stakes are high for big tech companies to ensure they have enough power to run those plants. That's why Microsoft is now throwing its weight behind nuclear power.\nThe tech giant on Friday signed a major deal with nuclear plant operator Constellation Energy to buy power for its data centers from the energy company's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant.\nThe plant is located right next to TMI-Unit 2, which infamously melted down in 1979. Unit 1 was shut down in 2019 as demand for nuclear energy waned amid competition from cheaper energy alternatives like natural gas, solar, and wind power.\nConstellation said it plans to spend $1.6 billion to revive the Unit 1 plant, pending regulatory approval, by 2028.\nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Microsoft has agreed to purchase all of the power from the reactor over the next 20 years, a Constellation spokesperson told TechCrunch. Once restored, the reactor promises a capacity of 835 megawatts.\nThe new plant will also be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC) after Constellation\u2019s former CEO, Chris Crane, who died in April. The plant is expected to create 3,400 direct and indirect jobs, add $16 billion to Pennsylvania's GDP, and generate more than $3 billion in state and federal taxes, according to an economic report commissioned by the Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council.\n\u201cPowering industries critical to our nation\u2019s global economic and technological competitiveness, including data centers, requires an abundance of energy that is carbon-free and reliable every hour of every day, and nuclear plants are the only energy sources that can consistently deliver on that promise,\u201d said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, in a statement.\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t the only tech company turning to nuclear energy to power AI data centers. OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman has called for an energy breakthrough in the form of nuclear power, and Amazon in March bought a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania for $650 million.\nMicrosoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all said they plan to run data centers entirely on green energy. Microsoft\u2019s goal is to do so by 2030, but in May, the company admitted its AI push is putting that goal into jeopardy.\nIn June, Bloomberg reported that big tech\u2019s upcoming data centers promise to consume a combined 508 terawatt hours of electricity per year if they run constantly. That would be more than the total electricity produced in Australia in a year.\nThe demand for clean electricity to power not just data centers but also electric vehicles, factories, and more has spurred a renaissance of sorts around nuclear power. Investors are increasingly bullish on nuclear fusion startups, which have raised $7.1 billion to date, since it represents a cleaner and more powerful future for nuclear power. It uses hydrogen as fuel, whereas nuclear power plants and their fission process rely on hard-to-come-by elements like uranium and plutonium.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/microsoft-taps-three-mile-island-nuclear-plant-to-power-ai/\n"

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has a history of producing the world's most valuable companies. United States Steel became the first-ever $1 billion company in 1901, and 117 years later, Apple became the first company in the world to surpass a $1 trillion valuation.\nApple is now worth over $3 trillion, but since 2018, tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet have joined it in the trillion-dollar club. But I think yet another is on track to join them.\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL) was founded in 1977 and has since participated in nearly every technological revolution. Right now, it's quickly becoming a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) data center infrastructure, which could be the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation.\nBased on Oracle's current market cap of $429 billion, investors who buy its stock today could earn a gain of 133% if it gets there.\nLarge language models (LLMs)\u00a0are at the foundation of every AI software application. They are trained by ingesting mountains of data, and from there, the model identifies patterns and learns to make predictions. Typically, the \"smartest\" AI applications are powered by the LLMs with the most data, and the training process is facilitated by centralized data centers filled with graphics processing units (GPUs).\nNvidia supplies the world's most powerful GPUs for developing AI models. Simply put, the more GPUs a developer can access, the more data they can feed into an LLM, and the faster it can be processed. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Supercluster technology allows developers to scale up to more than 32,000 Nvidia GPUs (and soon, over 65,000), which is more than any other data center provider.\nPlus, the company's random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology moves data from one point to another more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since developers often pay for computing capacity by the minute, OCI is among the fastest and cheapest solutions for training LLMs. That's why AI leaders like OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk's xAI are now using Oracle.\nOracle chairman Larry Ellison says the company currently has 85 live data centers, with 77 under construction. However, he estimates the company will eventually have somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000, so it has barely scratched the surface of its opportunity so far.\nAutomation is one thing that sets Oracle apart from other data center operators. No matter its size, every Oracle data center is identical in terms of functionality, so the company is able to manage them all with software alone -- no humans required. Not only is that a big cost savings for the end-user, but it also creates a more secure service by eliminating human error. Plus, automation is the key to scaling up Oracle's data center locations into the thousands.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), a 7% increase from the year-ago period. The OCI segment, specifically, delivered $2.2 billion in revenue, up by a whopping 46%.\nAs in previous quarters, OCI revenue would have grown even faster during Q1 if the company had more data centers online. It currently has an enormous backlog of customers waiting for more computing capacity.\nThat is reflected in Oracle's remaining performance obligations, which came in at a record $99 billion during the quarter, up 52% year over year. That was an acceleration from the 44% growth the company achieved in the final quarter of fiscal 2024. Oracle signed 42 new deals for GPU capacity worth $3 billion during Q1 alone, contributing to the sharp increase in remaining performance obligations (RPOs).\nCEO Safra Catz believes 38% of the company's RPOs (around $37.6 billion) will be converted to revenue over the next 12 months, which should help the company return to double-digit percentage growth at the top line. Additionally, she expects an acceleration in OCI growth compared to the previous fiscal year.\nOracle has generated $3.88 in trailing-12-month earnings per share. So, based on its current stock price of $155.89, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40.2. The Nasdaq-100 technology index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.7, so Oracle stock certainly isn't cheap when measured against its peers.\nHowever, Oracle's trailing-12-month earnings grew by 15% compared to the prior period, and Wall Street is forecasting accelerated earnings growth of 24% for fiscal 2025 overall. That might explain why investors are now willing to pay a premium for its stock.\nMathematically speaking, if Oracle's P/E ratio remains constant, the company could achieve a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years, even if its earnings growth slows to just 8.8%. But that's a very conservative estimate considering based on Ellison's comments, it could grow its data center footprint tenfold over the long term. If that happens, Oracle's earnings growth is likely to accelerate, not decelerate, in the coming decade.\nRemember, the company's data centers rely on automation, so they offer incredible scalability. In other words, Oracle should experience an expanding gross profit margin as more data centers are built, which will be a huge tailwind for its earnings.\nAs a result, I think Oracle has a great opportunity to join its big-tech peers in the $1 trillion club within the next decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\nWall Street darling NVIDIA Corp. saw its market capitalization climb to $2.61 trillion from $358 billion two years ago with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA stock\u2019s unparalleled surge this year hit a speed bump lately due to the violation of antitrust laws, and AI bubble qualms.\nMeanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang has sold NVIDIA\u2019s shares, which makes us wonder whether the chipmaker has the potential to increase shareholder wealth. Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed last week that Huang off-loaded more than $633 million of the chipmaker\u2019s stock since June. Huang has sold shares in tranches of 120,000 each from June 13 to Sept. 5, which accounts for almost 5.3 million shares.\nOn Friday, NVIDIA\u2019s shares posted their worst two-week stretch in two years, while the world\u2019s most sought-after AI player was subjected to wild price swings over the past month that dwarfed even the most volatile assets like cryptocurrency.\nGeopolitical tensions to legal issues plagued NVIDIA, with the stock witnessing a $279 billion wipeout in a single trading session last week. The U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed NVIDIA in a mounting antitrust issue.\nDoes this sound depressing? Fear not; the NVIDIA stock has an upside potential, and remaining bullish would reap benefits in the long run. Here are the positive reasons \u2013\nInvestors are waiting for the rollout of the cutting-edge new Blackwell chips. However, engineering snags have delayed the process. NVIDIA has been addressing the design flaws in the Blackwell B200 chip and aims to launch it by the year-end. So, the delay period is not long enough to impact the NVIDIA stock\u2019s 2025 results.\nMicrosoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. have already ordered Blackwell chips worth billions of dollars, and Amazon.com, Inc. is expected to move from Hopper to Blackwell.\nNVIDIA confirmed that the demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and may continue into the next fiscal year. After all, the Blackwell platform has more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform. The new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) has greater processing power, which is the most pressing need. It holds 208 billion transistors, way more than the 80 billion in the present H100 CHIP. Also, Blackwell\u2019s NVLink offers high-speed communication, which is the need of the hour.\nThus, strong demand for the Blackwell chip is expected to boost the NVIDIA stock following its launch. Lest we forget, NVIDIA\u2019s shares surged by double digits in the three months following the launch of two previous architectures \u2014 Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020.\nIn the dot-com bubble, companies\u2019 shares scaled upward based on hype before the real impact of their business models could be felt. However, AI has become an integral part of all businesses. According to Markets and Markets, the AI industry is poised to expand from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030.\nNVIDIA is well-poised to make the most of the flourishing AI industry since its chips are essential for AI models deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. This explains why the company\u2019s H100 graphic cards have huge demand in the AI chip market. Moreover, unlike the stocks in the Internet bubble, NVIDIA has solid fundamentals that validate the company\u2019s stretched valuations, and squash bubble fears.\nNVIDIA has generated profits competently since its return on equity (ROE) is almost 120%, which is way higher than the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 73.2%. Notably, any ROE above 100% shows that the company\u2019s net income is more than its equity, or the performance is strong.\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, above the industry\u2019s 47.6%. Any net margin of 20% indicates the company can curtail costs and generate profits.\nWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA recently approved a stock buyback worth $50 billion, indicating a healthy corporate organization. Share repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares, which bodes well for shareholders.\nBeing the worldwide leader in GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s stock will benefit. Huge data is expected to migrate from central processing units to GPUs, per Huang. According to Precedence Research, the GPU market will expand from $56.55 billion in 2023 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034.\nNVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Siemens to enter the metaverse space and the introduction of GeForce in the growing gaming market will act as a tailwind for the company. As a result, the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 76.1% yearly.\nBanking on the highly anticipated launch of the groundbreaking Blackwell chips, inherent capability to crush bubble concerns, the introduction of stock buyback plans, and a dominant player in the semiconductor space gives NVIDIA\u2019s shares the fuel to scale northward despite the current hiccups.\nProminent brokers, thus, have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 40.2% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $106.47. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is $200, indicating an upside of 87.9%.\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average year to date, a tell-tale long-term uptrend. This is why investors should hang on to this multi-bagger stock and not let it go.\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Eion Signs Deal to Deliver Carbon Removal Credits to Microsoft",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Enhanced weathering process will deliver 8,000 tons of CO2 removal over five years\nCompany raises Series A extension funding to further accelerate commercialization efforts\nOAKLAND, Calif., September 24, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eion, a carbon removal company turning the proven science of enhanced rock weathering (ERW) into a scalable climate solution, today announced a contract to deliver 8,000 tons of permanent CO2 removal to Microsoft. With a group of large farmers in the Mid-Atlantic, Eion will soon deploy olivine\u2014a naturally occurring and abundant mineral the company has optimized to weather quickly\u2014on farmland after the fall harvest. Every ton of carbon removed as part of the purchase will be verified through Eion\u2019s patented direct measurement approach, in accordance with third-party standards and verifiers, and will be delivered over the course of five years.\nEion also announced it has closed $3 million in Series A extension funding from agricultural distributor Growmark, AgFunder, Ridgeline, Trailhead Capital, Overture Partners, Mercator Partners, Exelon Foundation, and others. The additional capital will be used to build on growing commercial traction, deliver against new contracts, and further invest in R&D. Through its partnership with Growmark, Eion has the network to access millions of acres across the US and is beginning to work with farmers in the Midwest to deploy rock weathering at a greater scale.\nCollectively, the deal with Microsoft and capital infusion further validates the opportunity for ERW to become a meaningful climate solution and builds on recent company tailwinds:\nIn November 2023, Eion became the first enhanced weathering solution to deliver CO2 removal to Stripe, a significant vote of confidence in its scientifically-rigorous approach.\nAlso in November, Eion announced it secured guaranteed access to 500,000 tons of olivine annually from leading mineral solutions provider Sibelco\u2014a critical supply linchpin to meeting its ambitious goal of removing 10 million tons of CO2 each year starting in 2030.\nRecently, Eion was named a semifinalist in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Carbon Dioxide Removal Purchase Pilot Prize\u2014a first-of-its-kind federal initiative to catalyze market growth for CO2 removal technologies.\n\"A diverse coalition of stakeholders\u2014from corporate offtakers, to companies looking to deploy climate solutions in their own supply chains, to federal agencies\u2014are increasingly investing in the promise of enhanced weathering,\" said Anastasia Pavlovic, CEO of Eion. \"We\u2019re excited to work with Microsoft to continue demonstrating the true potential of the category and add to ERW\u2019s rapidly growing track record.\"\nAccelerating the Earth\u2019s process of naturally mineralizing rocks to balance atmospheric carbon levels, Eion compresses what would otherwise take thousands of years into a timeline of several years. Olivine\u2014legally approved for agricultural use for decades\u2014is ideal for ERW because it absorbs a high rate of carbon, and its composition includes various trace elements that enable Eion to accurately measure CO2 removal.\n\"Eion\u2019s verification methodology, continuous monitoring of environmental conditions, and established history of successfully delivering carbon removal makes them stand apart in ERW,\" said Brian Marrs, Senior Director, Energy Markets at Microsoft. \"We look forward to supporting this important component within the ecosystem of proven climate solutions.\"\n\"Understanding the opportunity we have to help make agriculture more sustainable drives us to support research and fund innovation through companies like Eion,\" said Wade Mittelstadt, Growmark\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\nEion's direct measurement process uses real-world data to account for how ERW works in the field. Using existing soil sampling practices and standard lab equipment and methods, Eion can uphold scientific rigor while continuously monitoring health and safety. Every soil sample taken by Eion is analyzed for the presence of trace elements, including nickel and chromium which are naturally present in agricultural soils, and benchmarked against the company\u2019s safety guardrails. Informed by verified data and risk exposure models from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), these guardrails enable Eion to be a responsible land steward and trusted partner to farmers and rural communities.\nAbout Eion\nEion is a carbon removal company responsibly scaling enhanced rock weathering (ERW) on agricultural lands. It holds an industry-first patent for directly measuring the carbon removed by mineral weathering in soils using immobile trace elements.\nCombining scientific rigor with agricultural know-how, Eion fits into routine farming practices to unlock scale without compromising safety and rigor. That includes using olivine, a naturally abundant mineral that balances soil pH while efficiently absorbing carbon dioxide, and relying on routine soil samples and standard equipment to measure carbon removal and monitor soil conditions.\nBy working with the agricultural system, Eion is on track to deliver 10 million tons of permanent carbon removal annually starting in 2030 while creating stable jobs in rural communities. Eion is backed by AgFunder and Ridgeline and scientifically vetted by Stripe Climate.

        "Title": "5 days after reports of 650 more Microsoft gaming layoffs, the company announces plans to pay out even more money to shareholders",
        "Author": "  Catherine Lewis ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nMicrosoft is set to start paying out even more to its shareholders in November, despite recent reports that the company is laying off 650 people from its gaming staff.\nAs reported by Bloomberg, Microsoft shareholders will soon see an increased quarterly dividend payout for every share they have. Come November 21, this is going up by 10%, to 83 cents per share rather than the current 75 cents. What's more, the company has announced a $60 billion scheme to buy back its stocks, replacing a separate program of the same value which Microsoft announced in 2021.\nThat's a lot of money \u2013 bear in mind that Microsoft previously acquired Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, so this isn't far off being in the same ballpark. All in all, it could be considered questionable timing, too, given that the announcement comes less than a week after it was reported that the company is laying off 650 of its gaming staff. Reportedly, most of the people affected hold corporate and support roles, with no games studios set to be closed as a result.\nMicrosoft's gaming teams have already had a rough year, as back in January, a separate 1,900 roles were cut across its Blizzard, Zenimax, and Xbox teams, and the closure of studios Tango Gameworks and Arcane Austin was announced in May. While Tango was later resurrected by Krafton, with around 50 staff re-hired in the process, it's still more than fair to say it's been a turbulent time.\nIt's worth noting that these quarterly dividends and the stock buyback scheme all relate to Microsoft in its entirety rather than just its gaming subsection, but even so, Bloomberg reports that, in July, the company said its free cash flow was up 18% year over year.\nAs layoffs batter the industry, FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki says now is the time \"for us to continue to grow and continue to cultivate this talent.\"\n"

Approximately 60% of global ad spend is now\u00a0funneled\u00a0toward Big Tech companies, including Google and Meta.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "$100 billion investment potential will enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth\nNEW YORK & REDMOND, Wash. & ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, September 17, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The drive to develop more powerful AI capabilities will require significant infrastructure investment to support it. Today, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Microsoft, and MGX announced the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to make investments in new and expanded data centers to meet growing demand for computing power, as well as energy infrastructure to create new sources of power for these facilities. These infrastructure investments will be chiefly in the United States fueling AI innovation and economic growth, and the remainder will be invested in U.S. partner countries.\nThis partnership will support an open architecture and broad ecosystem, providing full access on a non-exclusive basis for a diverse range of partners and companies. NVIDIA will support GAIIP, offering its expertise in AI data centers and AI factories to benefit the AI ecosystem. GAIIP will also actively engage with industry leaders to help enhance AI supply chains and energy sourcing for the benefit of its customers and the industry. The partnership will initially seek to unlock $30 billion of private equity capital over time from investors, asset owners, and corporates, which in turn will mobilize up to $100 billion in total investment potential when including debt financing.\nThe founders of the partnership bring together leading global investors BlackRock, GIP, and MGX, an artificial intelligence and advanced technology investor, with funding as well as expertise from Microsoft. GAIIP combines deep understanding of infrastructure and technology to drive efficient scaling of data centers, with energy, power, and decarbonization investment capabilities for related enabling infrastructure for AI.\nHis Highness Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of MGX, emphasized the importance of AI for the future of our economies: \"Artificial intelligence is not just an industry of the future, it underpins the future. Through this unique partnership, we will enable faster innovation, technological breakthroughs and transformational productivity gains across the global economy. The investments we make today will secure a more sustainable, prosperous and equitable future for all mankind.\"\n\"Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multi-trillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,\" said Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock. \"Data centers are the bedrock of the digital economy, and these investments will help power economic growth, create jobs, and drive AI technology innovation.\"\n\"We are committed to ensuring AI helps advance innovation and drives growth across every sector of the economy,\" said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. \"The Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership will help us deliver on this vision, as we bring together financial and industry leaders to build the infrastructure of the future and power it in a sustainable way.\"\n\"The capital spending needed for AI infrastructure and the new energy to power it goes beyond what any single company or government can finance,\" said Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft. \"This financial partnership will not only help advance technology, but enhance national competitiveness, security, and economic prosperity.\"\n\"Building the necessary infrastructure required to advance and accelerate the adoption of AI will reshape and revitalize almost every aspect of how we live,\" said Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, CEO of MGX. \"Similar to our transportation infrastructure, new data centers and power sources will enable growth and commerce in the future innovation economy.\"\n\"There is a clear need to mobilize significant amounts of private capital to fund investments in essential infrastructure. One manifestation of this is the capital required to support the development of AI,\" said Bayo Ogunlesi, Chairman and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners. \"We are highly confident that the combined capabilities of our partnership will help accelerate the pace of investments in AI-related infrastructure.\"\n\"Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"NVIDIA will use its expertise as a full stack computing platform to support GAIIP and its portfolio companies on the design and integration of AI factories to propel industry innovation.\"\nMGX was created in Abu Dhabi earlier this year to invest in AI and advanced technologies with global partners to enable the technology fabric of the global economy, focusing on AI infrastructure; AI-enabled technology; and semiconductors. Today\u2019s announcement is a major partnership within those segments, building on the emirate\u2019s longstanding investment track record in data centers, compute capacity, and enabling infrastructure.\nSignificant structural forces are creating opportunities for private capital to partner with corporations and governments to provide financing for critical infrastructure needs. BlackRock has a broad network of corporate relationships as a long-term investor in their debt and equity, and GIP specializes in investing in, owning, and operating some of the largest and most complex infrastructure assets in the world. These combined capabilities position BlackRock as a world leading investment platform to make these critical investments in data centers and related infrastructure, mobilizing private capital to support economic growth and job creation while generating long-term investment benefits for its clients.\nAbout BlackRock\nBlackRock\u2019s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being.

However, in late August and September, we observed two Russian actors MTAC tracks closely \u2026 using videos designed to discredit Harris and stoke controversy around her campaign.\u201d\nOne video shows what is purported to be an attack by Harris supporters on Trump rally attendees. Another accused Harris of being involved in a 2011 hit-and-run incident that paralyzed a 13-year-old girl. Both reports are false, but the hit and run video still went viral.\nMicrosoft warned that more of these troll videos are likely to emerge before Nov. 5 and would likely include actors and artificial intelligence-powered alterations.\nThe report comes one day after Meta announced it was banning Russian state media outlets like RT from its apps for engaging in political interference. The United States has accused RT and employees of funneling $10 million through shell entities to covertly fund influence campaigns on social media channels.\nRussia\u2019s hardly alone. Iran and China have also been accused of attempting to interfere in the election. Last month, OpenAI announced it had discovered an \u201cIranian influence operation\u201d using its tools to generate content to spread misinformation about the U.S. presidential race.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-09-16, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $393.21. It's currently trading at a price of $430.59. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -9.51%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.82\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.65%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 19.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n191.78\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n201.43\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n393.21\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $225.25. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -91.16%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

A copy of letter can be downloaded here. The strategy\u2019s recent net performance was behind market averages. Since the fund\u2019s inception, the strategy has underperformed for about 8% of the time on a rolling five-year basis. Several factors have contributed to the current underperformance, including not owning Nvidia, which explains about a third of the relative underperformance year-to-date. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions. The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 5.09%, and its shares gained 37.30% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 30, 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $430.30 per share with a market capitalization of $3.198 trillion.\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cGenerative AI\u2019s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called \u2018inference\u2019). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category \u2013 nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google\u2019s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in second position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies \u2014 especially generative AI \u2014 has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close up of a wind turbine producing electricity as the sun sets.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\u00a0\nConstellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) generates and sells electricity in the United States. The stock has jumped on the back of reports earlier this week that tech giant Microsoft was partnering with the utility firm to restart the Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst nuclear power accident in the US. The project is indicative of the growing power demand of AI data centers and also highlights the AI ambitions of Microsoft. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has reportedly written a letter asking grid operator PJM Interconnection to allow the Three Mile Island reactor to be allowed to come online as quickly as possible rather than waiting in the queue as if they were an entirely new development. Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro has said that the 20-year Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) contract with Microsoft proves the value of nuclear power for hyperscalers.\nOverall CEG ranks 17th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Velosio announces the ClearPath program to help Dynamics GP users navigate their path forward\nFINDLAY, Ohio, Sept. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Velosio, a leading Microsoft partner providing business technology solutions, today acknowledged Microsoft's formal announcement regarding the end of life for Microsoft Dynamics GP. Support for the product will cease in September 2029, with minimal critical security updates available until April 2031. The news marks a significant milestone for the thousands of businesses that have relied on Dynamics GP for decades.\nMicrosoft Dynamics GP, originally known as Great Plains Software, was first developed in the early 1990s by Great Plains Software, a company based in Fargo, North Dakota. Microsoft acquired Great Plains in 2001, integrating its enterprise resource planning (ERP) system into the Dynamics product family. Over the years, Dynamics GP became a popular mid-market ERP solution, known for its financial management, supply chain, and business operations capabilities. \"For many businesses, Microsoft Dynamics GP has been more than just software; it's been a lifeline\u2014a tool that has empowered accounting, operations, and finance teams to thrive. While the end of support is a groundbreaking moment, we at Velosio are here to ensure that our clients not only navigate this transition smoothly but also come out stronger with modern solutions that drive enhanced profitability,\" said Robbie Morrison, Chief Executive Officer at Velosio.\nMicrosoft made the announcement emphasizing their high growth plans for cloud business applications that have skyrocketed in recent years, primarily with their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions, including Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC) and Finance & Supply Chain Management (F&SCM). Forbes ranked Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central as the \"Best Overall\" ERP system.\nFor years, Microsoft Dynamics GP has been the backbone of countless businesses, providing a robust and reliable ERP solution.

Microsoft's decision to sunset Dynamics GP marks the beginning of a new era for many businesses.\nIn preparing for this shift, many companies will have questions.

        "Author": "  Emma Hinchliffe, Nina Ajemian ",
        "Text": "Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on more sexual assault charges, two women are now behind most U.S. mortgages, and AI companies join a commitment to update the Violence Against Women Act for the 2020s. Have a restful weekend. \n- VAWA and AI. Thirty years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act was signed into law. The legislation helped take domestic violence from an issue considered a \"private family matter\" to a serious crime. Between 1993 and 2022, domestic violence in the U.S. dropped 67%.\nToday, gender-based violence also happens online. As part of a new set of initiatives marking the legislation's 30th anniversary today, the White House has secured voluntary commitments from major tech companies to prevent online sexual abuse, including nonconsensual AI deepfakes.\nAdobe, Anthropic, Cohere, Microsoft, and OpenAI committed to removing nude images from AI training datasets \"when appropriate and depending on the purpose of the model.\" Those companies also committed to \"stress-testing strategies in their development processes\" to guard against AI models releasing image-based sexual abuse. Companies also committed to responsibly sourcing their data sets to avoid image-based sexual abuse.\nThe commitments aim to address not just the creation of this content but also its distribution, or the \"nefarious ways...this gets out into the world,\" says Jen Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council. Companies are responsible for sticking to these commitments themselves, but the White House says getting these major tech businesses on board at all is a win for survivors of online abuse. \"It names it and acknowledges it's real harm,\" Klein says. \"It's not something that happens online and stays online.\"\nThe commitments from major players in AI build on actions from other tech companies, including Square and CashApp, which previously agreed to limit payments for companies producing or distributing abusive sexual images. Google, Meta, and Snap Inc. have also taken various steps, the White House said, including improving reporting systems and amplifying resources for survivors of abuse.\nPresident Joe Biden was the one who introduced VAWA as a senator 30 years ago. With his time in office coming to a close, this rollout implies he sees reducing violence against women as a signature issue of his career and administration. It's one that Vice President Kamala Harris would be likely to continue if she wins the White House. \"I know that one of the things she would continue to work on is addressing gender-based violence wherever and whenever it occurs,\" Klein says.\nThis week's announcements also include the funding of a resource center that addresses cybercrimes, including cyberstalking and nonconsensual and unlawful sharing of nude images. Outside of online abuse, there's additional funding for the Department of Justice for the prevention of gender-based violence. Five federal agencies are committed to working together to meet the housing needs of survivors of domestic abuse, which is a leading cause of homelessness. (Some were initially authorized by the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022.)\nBiden hosted survivors of domestic abuse at the White House last night to mark the anniversary. He wrote in a Glamour op-ed: \"We cannot stop fighting until every woman and girl on this planet is not only free from violence, fear, and abuse\u2014but empowered to reach her full potential.\"\nEmma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com\nThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

        "Author": "  Claire Shefchik ",
        "Text": "Kamala Harris has her sights set on AI \u2013 and Big Tech might want to pay attention. As Biden's so-called \"AI czar,\" Harris is already deep into the conversation on regulating artificial intelligence. The question on everyone's mind is: How will her push for safety impact tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet?\nDon't Miss:\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nHarris is no stranger to the tech world. In 2020, she garnered support from major players like Microsoft's Brad Smith and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. Fast forward to today, and she's still being backed by Silicon Valley heavyweights. After Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her for president, Harris raked in over $50 million in donations in just 24 hours. But now, as AI becomes a more prominent issue, her relationship with tech is evolving.\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nHarris has made it clear she prioritizes safety over profit. \"In the absence of regulation ... some tech companies choose profit over the well-being of their customers,\" she said at an AI Safety Summit. She's all for keeping AI in check, but that's not exactly music to the ears of companies like Microsoft and Alphabet, which are heavily invested in AI development.\nSo what does this mean for Big Tech? If Harris follows Biden's lead, we can expect a continuation of his AI regulation plans, with maybe a few tweaks here and there. She's not looking to rewrite the rule book but is focused on ensuring AI is used responsibly. That could mean more oversight and stricter regulations, especially regarding how these companies handle user data and develop AI systems.\nTrending: The startup behind White Castle's favorite Robot Fry Cook announces a next-generation fast food robot \u2013 Here's how to get a share for under $5 today.\nBut Harris isn't just about cracking down. She's also a longtime supporter of tech innovation. From her days as a district attorney in San Francisco to her time questioning Meta's Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill, Harris has shown she can be firm but fair with tech leaders. She's uniquely positioned to balance innovation and safety, especially given her connections to Silicon Valley.\nOn the other hand, Donald Trump is making a different kind of pitch to the tech world. He's offering deregulation and tax cuts, something many business leaders find attractive. Venture capitalists and big names like Elon Musk are backing Trump's campaign, seeing him as the candidate who will favor the bottom line over tighter controls.\nBoth candidates are vying for the tech industry\u2019s support in distinct ways.

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Stan Druckenmiller saw the potential for the next wave of artificial intelligence fairly early. That led him to take a big position in Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2022. He added Microsoft in the first quarter of 2023, after it upped its stake in generative AI leader OpenAI. At the start of this year, he started taking gains on his Nvidia investment and put some into Apple.\nBut Druckenmiller has quickly changed his tune on the three biggest companies in the world. He sold shares of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft during the second quarter, according to his latest 13F filing with the SEC. Instead, he's focused on high-yield dividend stocks, which could all see their stock prices benefit from rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\nThe Fed started this easing cycle on Sept. 18 with a 0.5-percentage-point cut to the federal funds rate. The market expects two 0.25-percentage-point cuts over the next three months and even further cuts in 2025. Here are the three stocks Druckenmiller is buying to take advantage.\nDuring the second quarter, Druckenmiller bought 889,355 shares of Philip Morris (NYSE: PM), in addition to call options giving him the right to buy an additional 963,000. Combined, the entire position was worth $187.7 million at the end of June.\nPhilip Morris is the world leader for an industry in decline. As the health risks of cigarettes are taught to new generations, fewer young consumers are buying cigarettes. But Philip Morris is committed to replacing cigarettes with smoke-free alternatives.\nThe tobacco company's smoke-free product portfolio includes popular heat sticks brand Iqos and Zyn nicotine pouches. It now estimates 36.5 million active customers of those smoke-free products. The Iqos brand is set to launch in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, which could provide another boost to its sales.\nEven as Philip Morris focuses on the future of nicotine products, it's been able to maintain is cigarette sales through steady pricing power. Its market dominance, including brands like Marlboro and Parliament, give it strong pricing power, enabling it to offset declining unit sales.\nThe stock currently trades around 17.5 times forward earnings estimates and yields about 4.5%. That's a fair price to pay for a company that should be able to consistently grow earnings and its dividend as it manages the current transition within its industry.\nDruckenmiller added 2,872,665 shares of Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) to his portfolio during the second quarter. That follows an initial purchase of 3,880,500 shares in the first quarter. The total value of the billionaire's position as of the end of the second quarter was $134.2 million.\nKinder Morgan is responsible for transporting approximately 40% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. Its current growth driver, however, are liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities.\nManagement expects demand for natural gas to grow substantially between now and 2030. Liquefied natural gas exports could double during that period. On top of that, chairman Richard Kinder discussed the potential of AI to drive demand for energy during the company's second-quarter earnings call.\nAs companies build more AI data centers, they'll need to power them, and renewable energy isn't at the point where it can keep up with demand. Training and running advanced AI models requires a lot of energy, even as chipmakers work to make their designs more power efficient.\nThe stock currently trades at an enterprise value of 12.2 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and yields about 5.3%. That valuation is near the high end of comparable companies, but it may be worth the price for a company in the dominant position of Kinder. Its steady free cash flow growth should support its dividend for years to come.\nDruckenmiller's last big buy from the second quarter was Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE: MAA). He established a position of 644,190 shares of the real estate investment trust (REIT), worth $91.9 million at the end of June.\nMAA focused on residential multifamily properties. It currently owns 103,600 apartment units across the Sunbelt region. MAA focuses on markets with strong job growth, expanding populations, and high household formation rates. The result is strong demand for housing, which enables MAA to grow rental rates faster than the market.\nAs a REIT, it can benefit from falling interest rates. That means a lower cost of debt while making the yield on shares look even more attractive relative to bond investments. But MAA isn't waiting for rates to fall to invest in the future. It has $1 billion in its development pipeline.\nThe stock trades for about 17.4 times funds from operations (FFO) per share. That's roughly in line with other residential real estate investment trusts. But with its investments in the future, it could see strong growth in rents and FFO. And, with the shares currently yielding about 3.6%, it may be worth a closer look for investors interested in diversifying their portfolio with a REIT.\nBefore you buy stock in Philip Morris International, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Philip Morris International wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-09-02, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $393.21. It's currently trading at a price of $417.14. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -6.09%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.82\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.91%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 19.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n191.78\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n201.43\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n393.21\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $225.25. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -85.19%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Lithos Carbon Signs New Three-Year Agreement with Microsoft for Research and Permanent and Verified Carbon Removal\nBELLEVUE, Wash, September 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Lithos Carbon announced Microsoft as a return carbon removal customer, having signed a new, three-year agreement to permanently remove CO\u2082 using Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW).\nAs of December 2023, Lithos Carbon delivered 500 tons of carbon removal for Microsoft, by deploying ultra-fine, organic-grade volcanic basalt rock dust on US farmland. This summer, Lithos Carbon deployed a novel carbon removal research field for Microsoft in collaboration with leading researchers. This project in a subtropical environment uses exceptionally high-resolution measurement validation to generate transparent large-scale datasets. The project enables more rapid deployment with enhanced standards for accounting.\nLithos Carbon\u2019s agreement is to deliver ex-post* and empirically quantified carbon removal, meaning that carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere has been achieved and has been rigorously quantified. Alongside this removal, Lithos Carbon will continue to enhance and publish its robust measurement techniques that will validate not only the precise quantity of carbon removed, but the speed with which carbon is captured. With a unique field-by-field approach, Lithos Carbon is also spearheading cascading agronomic and ecosystem benefits for agricultural growers, helping scale adoption in the broader carbon removal market.\nAlready, the natural process of rock weathering is estimated to draw down around 1.1 billion tons of CO\u2082 every year. By enhancing this process, Lithos Carbon is scaling carbon removal that\u2019s permanent, measurable, and available today. By deploying carefully selected basalt \u2013 the most plentiful volcanic rock in the world \u2013 on croplands, Lithos Carbon is accelerating the removal of CO\u2082 from the atmosphere in a matter of human seasons rather than geologic millennia. Carbon in the air is then locked away for tens of thousands of years, when the rainwater reacts with the silicate rock and traps the CO\u2082 as bicarbonate, the material that seashells are made from. Lithos Carbon uses upcycled volcanic dust sources and repurposes them into valuable agricultural products: no new emissions are created in this process.\nBecause of its permanence, potential for wide-scale agricultural adoption, and potential cost-efficiency for carbon removal at-scale, ERW represents one of the most compelling pathways to meet urgent climate goals within the next decade. Lithos Carbon\u2019s data-focused research site unites an unconflicted and impartial team of world-leading ERW, biogeochemistry, and agricultural academic parties. Researchers from the Yale Center of Natural Carbon Capture are carrying out cross-validation on the large-scale trial across 3,000 commercial farmland acres. The multi-method project directly compares all of the leading approaches for in-field CO\u2082 removal measurement. Data from this work will be made public and open to the academic community. By conducting this collaborative project, Lithos Carbon and researchers will drive for more rigor and transparency in the field.\n\"Microsoft has been a worldwide leader in sustainability and we\u2019re thrilled to work with them as a backer of our catalytic, data-driven project,\" said Lithos Carbon\u2019s CEO, Mary Yap. \"Our mission is to work alongside farmers to transform cropland into carbon capture centers and remove a billion tons of CO\u2082 over a decade. This agreement represents a significant step in that direction with a commitment to increasing quantification and diligent measurement across large-scale commercial deployments. Our deal develops the system and technologies needed to scale outcomes-based carbon removal while responsibly stewarding our natural resources to enrich communities and agricultural land.\"\nFor Microsoft, this carbon removal purchase supports its commitment of being carbon negative by 2030, while aiding the company's work to help scale the carbon removal market.\n\"Supporting innovative solutions is central to Microsoft\u2019s carbon removal strategy,\" said Brian Marrs at Microsoft. \"Lithos Carbon\u2019s dedication towards continued improvements in rigorously quantified Enhanced Rock Weathering systems and uncertainty reduction aligns with Microsoft\u2019s pursuit of high-quality CDR projects, and we look forward to further advancements in Enhanced Rock Weathering.\"\nLithos Carbon\u2019s newest agreement with Microsoft is to empirically quantify over 11,400 metric tons of permanent carbon removal. As of August 2024, Lithos Carbon has spread hundreds of thousands of tons of fine basalt rock dust in North America and is working with 100+ farmers over nine states. Lithos Carbon has also collected more than 10,000 soil cores that are being used to validate accurate carbon removal in new regions.\nThis news follows Lithos Carbon being named both a finalist in the XPRIZE Carbon Removal Challenge and a semifinalist in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Carbon Dioxide Removal Purchase Pilot Prize just this May.\nFootnotes:\n*Ex-post refers to the verification of carbon removal that has already taken place, providing a retrospective measurement of the effectiveness of a carbon removal project.\nAbout Lithos Carbon\nLithos Carbon is a carbon removal company scaling Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) as a solution to the climate crisis. Lithos Carbon\u2019s mission is to transform farmland into carbon capture centers \u2014 removing a billion tons of atmospheric CO\u2082 this decade while improving crop yields. Founded in March 2022 by repeat entrepreneurs and the world\u2019s leading experts in atmospheric geochemistry, Lithos Carbon\u2019s technology offers an optimization platform that permanently removes CO\u2082 from the atmosphere in a matter of human seasons rather than geologic millennia. Cost effective, immediately scalable, and empirically measured, Lithos Carbon\u2019s deployments are custom designed on a field-by-field basis to improve yield, protect crops, and enhance soil conditions.

        "Text": "SOMERVILLE, Mass., September 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Low-carbon cement technology leader Sublime Systems and Microsoft have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) indicating their intent to negotiate a contract for the purchase of environmental attribute certificates (EACs) generated from Sublime\u2019s first commercial facilities. The outcomes of this collaboration are intended to inform the development of a book and claim market and demonstrate the impact that this innovative model can have on the decarbonization of the cement and concrete sector, which currently accounts for about 8% of global CO2 emissions.\n\"Low-carbon cement is a critical climate solution not only for our work to become carbon negative by 2030, but also for the world as we look to transition to a net-zero economy,\" said Julia Fidler, Fuel and Materials Decarbonization Lead, Microsoft. \"We look forward to collaborating with Sublime and an ecosystem of industry partners to develop systems that are verifiable and held to the highest standards of integrity.\"\nMicrosoft\u2019s use of innovative contracting structures, such as purchasing the environmental benefits provided by Sublime Cement\u2122, heralds a faster transition to decarbonized construction.\n\"This partnership enables us to tap Microsoft\u2019s enthusiasm for low-carbon cement as a tool for lowering their Scope 3 emissions, in regions where our production is not yet scaled,\" said Dr. Leah Ellis, CEO and co-founder of Sublime Systems. \"Microsoft\u2019s collaboration unleashes powerful signals to the broader market that there is bankable demand for our low-carbon cement and that we must scale to meet that demand. We look forward to a future where there is a Sublime Cement\u2122 plant in every region, a future that today\u2019s partnership enables us to swiftly build towards.\"\nBook and claim models decouple the environmental attributes from the product itself and enable low-carbon materials producers to access a customer base well beyond their immediate geographic area. These models are presently utilized by various industries, such as electricity, aviation, and maritime shipping. Microsoft and Sublime are developing their EAC transaction to be verifiable, additional, and catalytic, criteria that a Microsoft and RMI report previously highlighted as foundational for a book and claim model to be impactful in decarbonizing steel and concrete.\nThis MOU is part of Microsoft\u2019s multi-prong 2024 strategy to forge \"partnerships to accelerate technology breakthroughs\" for greener concrete. It builds on Microsoft\u2019s prior history of book and claim agreements in sustainable aviation fuel and clean energy technologies.\nSpecifically, Microsoft\u2019s EAC purchases could accelerate the time to market for Sublime\u2019s manufacturing technology and enhance the commercial viability of the company\u2019s 1st and 2nd low-carbon cement plants. This agreement will focus the companies\u2019 efforts on developing the ideal structure for Microsoft to purchase EACs from the first commercial facility Sublime is developing in Holyoke, MA, which is expected to have a 30,000 TPY production capacity and may open as early as 2026. That facility has been selected to receive an investment from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) and will focus on scale-up of Sublime\u2019s \"true-zero\" cement manufacturing technology, which avoids the two major emissions sources of cement production and does not require carbon capture or clean up.\nSublime\u2019s engagement with Microsoft builds on this and other recent momentum, including a just-announced $75 million strategic investment from global building materials majors Holcim and CRH, spanning equity and a pre-paid offtake for Sublime Cement\u2122. To engage with Sublime on strategic or commercial opportunities, email partnerships@sublime-systems.com.\nAbout Sublime Systems\nSublime Systems is on a mission to have a swift, massive, and enduring impact on global CO2 emissions by decarbonizing cement. Unlike net-zero solutions that rely on carbon capture or removal, Sublime's fully electrified, \"true-zero\" approach avoids the industry\u2019s legacy fossil-fueled kilns and limestone feedstock. Sublime\u2019s electrochemical process instead extracts reactive calcium and silicates from an abundance of raw materials at ambient temperature, to make ASTM C1157-compliant Sublime Cement\u2122, a drop-in replacement for ordinary portland cement in concrete. Sublime was founded at MIT by Dr. Leah Ellis and Prof. Yet-Ming Chiang, both respected experts in materials science, electrochemical systems, and sustainability research. The company has raised over $200M in funding from leading climate tech investors, global cement incumbents, and cooperative agreements with the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s ARPA-E, IEDO, and OCED award programs. It currently operates a Somerville, MA-based pilot plant with a >250 TPY nameplate production capacity and is developing its 30,000 TPY first commercial facility to open in Holyoke, MA as early as 2026.

        "Author": "  Research and Markets ",
        "Text": "Data Center Infrastructure Market\nDublin, Sept. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Data Center Infrastructure Market - Forecasts from 2024 to 2029\" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The global data centre infrastructure market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.23%, reaching a market size of US$5.859 billion in 2029 from US$3.795 billion in 2024Data center infrastructure includes IT infrastructure devices, equipment, and technologies that strongly comprise a data centre. Data center infrastructure is even required by IT and big multinational companies for storing data and running networks across their businesses. This market is growing due to increasing colocation and data centres worldwide. The increasing demand for cloud networking is majorly driving the market for data centre infrastructure. The increasing need for data centres to store this ever-growing volume of data is fueling the demand for data centre infrastructure. \nThe data centre infrastructure market is also growing due to increased demand for servers, computers, networking equipment like routers or switches, security components like firewalls or biometric security sensors, storage capacity, and data centre management software and applications. The market is also witnessing noteworthy growth owing to the aging IT infrastructure, which cannot store the current data volume. As such, companies are moving towards more intelligent physical infrastructure data centre systems.The global data centre infrastructure market is segmented by solution, end-user, and geography. By solution, it is divided into hardware, software, and services. The market is further segmented by end-users into cloud providers, enterprise, and colocation providers.Rising demand for hardware data solutionsThe growing number of data centres worldwide is augmenting the demand for hardware solutions to manage data centres. The increasing number of cloud service providers demands more storage facilities, with a growing volume of big data generated yearly. This, in turn, is spurring the demand for servers, cables, networking equipment, storage space, and physical server racks & chassis, thus driving the market for the data centre infrastructure.Further, the growing use of data centres is increasing the requirement for data centre infrastructure software for managing data centres and colocation centres. Increasing investments to create a skilled workforce will likely support the growth of service solutions. For example, companies like Cisco are providing certified courses for special training in data centre networking and technology to improve employees' fit according to advancing technology.Increasing use by cloud service providersThe growth is attributed to the increasing number of cloud service providers worldwide for storing data and providing smooth access to their customers using efficient networking devices. This, in turn, bolsters the market growth of data centre infrastructure. The colocation centre as an end-user segment also holds considerable market share with increasing investments in colocation centres due to the requirement for large data storage spaces for big IT and multinational companies that need additional space for storing data and for networking purposes.A lot of cloud service providers and colocation centres are collaborating to provide data centre infrastructure in various countries across the world for better connectivity and networking. For example, Interxion, a leading provider of carrier and cloud-neutral colocation data center services in Europe, announced that dedicated access to Google Cloud Platform would be available across Europe through its Cloud Connect. Additionally, a new data center is set to be set up in Frankfurt by the company as a response to continuous demand from customersHigh energy consumption & complex cooling needsHigh energy utilization and complex cooling requirements greatly restrict the market for data center infrastructure. Data centers are famous for their high power usage; as they increase in size and capacity, the more power they need. This leads to considerable operational costs and environmental concerns because of the carbon emissions associated with the production of electricity. Data center operators are being forced to make costly and time-consuming investments in energy-efficient infrastructure to reduce energy consumption and meet sustainability targets.Data centers also face another significant barrier in demanding cooling conditions there. To maintain optimum temperatures needed to run servers and equipment requires complicated cooling systems. Hence, it is necessary for them to be established and maintained, which is always expensive in terms of capital outlay at any given time due to the frequent use of a lot of energy by such plants for their operations, including paying electricity bills. Cooling infrastructure has made it harder for administrators of data centers because there is a lot of it involved, which is hard to manage and calls for specific knowledge and resources. Consequently, the market demand for data center infrastructure is constrained by these challenges, which present obstacles in the form of cost, energy efficiency, and operational complexity.North America is expected to grow rapidly during the forecast period.In North America, there are multiple technology wizards. Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technology are very popular in this area. It will be necessary for data center facilities with trustworthy data centers to deal with the increasing complexities of these technologies. Moreover, the U.S. economy is one of the globe's fastest-growing economies, which will likely motivate the growth of public cloud data centers. Data centres are widely used in the United States, where the IT industry is the largest employer in the private sector and drives the market growth. Additionally, in the hyper-scale platforms in the United States, data centre services have become mandatory attributable to the increased hyper-scale platforms in the country.\nKey Attributes:\nReport Attribute\nDetails\nNo. of Pages\n137\nForecast Period\n2024 - 2029\nEstimated Market Value (USD) in 2024\n$3.79 Billion\nForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2029\n$5.85 Billion\nCompound Annual Growth Rate\n9.2%\nRegions Covered\nGlobal\nCompany Profiles\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP\nCisco Systems, Inc.\nMicrosoft\nEaton\nIntel Corporation\nSiemens\nHitachi, Ltd.\nFriedHelm Loh Group (Rittal - The System)\nKey Topics Covered: 1.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks.\nThe latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of\u00a0 AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 156\u00a0\u00a0\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) makes and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors.

On Thursday, Microsoft took a major step to give revenge porn victims a tool to stop its Bing search engine from returning these images.\nMicrosoft announced a partnership with StopNCII, an organization that allows victims of revenge porn to create a digital fingerprint of these explicit images, real or not, on their device. StopNCII's partners then use that digital fingerprint, or \"hash\" as it's technically known, to scrub the image from their platforms. Microsoft's Bing joins Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, Pornhub and OnlyFans in partnering with StopNCII, and using its digital fingerprints to stop the spread of revenge porn.\nIn a blog post, Microsoft says it already took action on 268,000 explicit images being returned through Bing's image search in a pilot through the end of August with StopNCII's database. Previously, Microsoft offered a direct reporting tool, but the company says that's proven to be not enough.\n\"We have heard concerns from victims, experts, and other stakeholders that user reporting alone may not scale effectively for impact or adequately address the risk that imagery can be accessed via search,\" said Microsoft in its blog post on Thursday.\nYou can imagine how much worse that problem would be on a significantly more popular search engine: Google.\nGoogle Search offers its own tools to report and remove explicit images from its search results, but has faced criticism from former employees and victims for not partnering with StopNCII, according to a Wired investigation. Since 2020, Google users in South Korea have reported 170,000 search and YouTube links for unwanted sexual content, Wired reported.\nThe AI deepfake nude problem is already widespread. StopNCII's tools only work for people over 18, but \"undressing\" sites are already creating problems for high schoolers around the country. Unfortunately, the United States doesn't have an AI deepfake porn law to hold anyone accountable, so the country is relying on a patchwork approach of state and local laws to address the issue.\nSan Francisco prosecutors announced a lawsuit in August to take down 16 of the most \"undressing\" sites. According to a tracker for deepfake porn laws created by Wired, 23 American states have passed laws to address nonconsensual deepfakes, while nine have struck down proposals.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/microsoft-gives-deepfake-porn-victims-a-tool-to-scrub-images-from-bing-search/\n"
