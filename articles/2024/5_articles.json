        "Text": "For the first time in a long time, the battle between Macs and PCs is interesting again.\nApple's (AAPL) products have been beating out Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows-based PCs for years thanks to their superior battery life and performance. But Microsoft says it\u2019s finally tipped the scales back in its own favor.\n\u201cWe have more powerful silicon. We've rewritten [Windows 11] to take advantage of it. And then we have unique experiences we've built on top of that platform,\u201d Microsoft consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo I think we have a distinct advantage for a period of time here.\u201d\nMicrosoft says it\u2019s achieved this through a new category of AI PCs it\u2019s calling Copilot+ PCs.\nYou\u2019ve probably already heard about AI PCs, which are PCs that include special neural processing units (NPUs) that can run AI apps locally rather than relying on cloud-based services like ChatGPT.\nCopilot+ PCs include those same NPUs, but also come with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and, importantly, run Microsoft\u2019s Copilot AI assistant for Windows 11.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot+ PCs come as the PC industry hopes it\u2019s entering a period of sustained sales growth after two years of steep declines. According to IDC, PC sales grew 1.5% in the first quarter compared to a drop of 28.7% in Q1 last year.\n\u201cThere's no doubt in my mind that the demand is here,\u201d Mehdi said. \u201cAnd this is going to spur a purchase of PCs in ways that we haven't had before.\u201d\nFor the first time in decades, Mehdi added, Microsoft feels it has an edge on Apple from both a performance standpoint and because it offers \u201ccompletely unique things that you can\u2019t do anywhere else.\u201d\nApple is notoriously behind Microsoft in the AI race, having sat on the sidelines until very recently \u2014 though it has made sure that its hardware has extremely fast AI-ready chips.\nLooking to take advantage of Apple being caught on the back foot, Microsoft hopes the Copilot+, which is powered by GPT-4o, will provide a seismic productivity boost with the ability to serve as a user's go-to assistant for tasks ranging from dealing with common problems like audio issues to summarizing documents.\nMicrosoft also introduced its new Copilot Recall, a feature that makes it easier to search virtually everything you\u2019ve done on your PC, including documents, photos, and web pages. So, if you were planning a trip to Seattle but lost the site you were using to look up things to do, you can type \u201cSeattle\u201d into Recall, which will pull up the site you were browsing.\nMicrosoft says it does this by taking a snapshot of your screen over time and then using Copilot\u2019s visual search feature to find the content you\u2019re looking for. The company also says content saved in Recall is only stored on your device and that you can customize which apps use the feature.\nMicrosoft\u2019s first Copilot+ PCs will hit the market in June starting at $999, conspicuously the same price as Apple\u2019s MacBook Air.\nWindows and Mac users may have different priorities, with many of them engrained in a specific ecosystem and unlikely to change. That is, unless perhaps fresh and exclusive AI functionality lures somebody over the fence. But they can still be put head to head.\nPerformance benchmarks have become major talking points, and Apple\u2019s Mac laptops have been crushing Windows-based PCs in terms of power efficiency ever since the iPhone maker rolled out its first M1 chip for MacBooks in 2020.\nThose Arm-based (ARM) chips have made it so MacBooks can last all day on a single charge while providing exceptional overall performance across a multitude of use cases. But Microsoft says its Windows PCs have a new weapon that puts it back in a leadership position: Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Pro chips.\nDuring its announcement on Monday, the company said a Copilot+ PC running on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite chip gets 20% more battery life, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance than Apple\u2019s MacBook Air with an M3 chip.\nWhat\u2019s more, Mehdi said Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs beat out Apple\u2019s latest M4 chip in terms of trillions of operations per second, or TOPs, a common measurement for gauging potential AI app performance.\nFor now, Microsoft has the edge thanks to an actual AI product. But Apple isn\u2019t taking any of this lying down. The company will host its annual WWDC event on June 10, where it\u2019s expected to roll out its own AI apps and services, including some that Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman says will run on OpenAI\u2019s AI software.\nAnd as far as its MacBooks go, Apple is still likely to announce its M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, which should offer better performance than its M4 and could outpace Qualcomm\u2019s chips.\nMark June 10 on your calendar.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nSEATTLE (Reuters) -Microsoft on Monday debuted a new category of personal computers with AI features as it rushes to build the emerging technology into products across its business and compete with Alphabet and Apple.\nAt an event on its campus in Redmond, Washington, Chief Executive Satya Nadella introduced what Microsoft calls \"Copilot+\" PCs, saying that it and a range of manufacturers would sell them, including Acer and Asustek Computer.\nMicrosoft launched the laptops as its shares trade near record highs following a Wall Street rally driven by expectations that AI will fuel strong profit growth for the company and its Big Tech rivals.\nAble to handle more artificial-intelligence tasks without calling on cloud data centers, the new computers will start at $1,000 and begin shipping on June 18.\nThe ability to crunch AI data directly on the computer lets Copilot+ include a feature called \"Recall.\" \"Recall\" tracks everything done on the computer, from Web browsing to voice chats, creating a history stored on the computer that the user can search when they need to remember something they did, even months later.\nThe company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the \"Minecraft\" video game.\nYusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\nGlobal PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.\n\"People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,\u201d said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.\nMicrosoft's new \"Copilot+\" computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the \"Ultrabook\" category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple's MacBook Air.\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Copilot.\nMicrosoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. It also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.\nMicrosoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before its annual developer conference.\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as they race to dominate the field.\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\nWindows PC makers have been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips.\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Author": "  Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has signed a first-of-its-kind global framework agreement to accelerate renewable energy capacity expansion. The five-year deal will help support the development of over 10.5 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable energy capacity. That's a staggering eight times larger than the biggest corporate power-purchase agreement (PPA) ever signed. \nThe tech titan signed this agreement with Brookfield Asset Management and its affiliate Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP). It significantly expands their long-standing relationship with Microsoft. The deal, reportedly supporting more than $10 billion of future developments, will meaningfully enhance and extend Brookfield Renewable's long-term growth outlook. \nThe global renewable energy framework agreement provides a visible pathway for Brookfield to build and deliver over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity in the U.S. and Europe between 2026 and 2030. That will help support Microsoft's goal of reaching 100% zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030. \nIt significantly enhances the companies' relationship. Microsoft currently has PPAs covering nearly 1 GW of renewable energy from Brookfield. \nThe deal will provide Microsoft with access to a pipeline of new renewable energy capacity to support the growing demand for its cloud services. In addition to wind and solar, the agreement will focus on new and impactful carbon-free energy generation technologies. The tech giant needs more electricity to support power-hungry data centers that are required to capitalize on growing digitalization and the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). AI applications require significant computing power that, in turn, demands massively more electricity. \nWhile the agreement initially focuses on building capacity in the U.S. and Europe, Microsoft can increase the scope to Asia-Pacific, India, and Latin America. The deal incentivizes Brookfield to build a large portfolio of renewable energy projects. \nBrookfield Renewable is the perfect partner for Microsoft. Few companies can match its global scale and development capabilities. It has one of the world's largest operating portfolios with 33 GW of capacity across several technologies (hydro, wind, solar, and storage) and geographies (North and South America, Europe, and Asia Pacific). \nOn top of that, it has a leading development pipeline with a staggering 155.4 GW of projects in various stages. Brookfield also boasts a portfolio of sustainable solutions, including nuclear services, renewable natural gas, and carbon capture and storage. \nThe Microsoft deal could enable Brookfield to more rapidly advance projects in its development pipeline. The agreement could also open the door to additional growth opportunities for Brookfield in the future. Its broader focus beyond wind and solar could accelerate the development of new carbon-free generation technologies.\nBrookfield Renewable expects to grow its funds from operations (FFO) by more than 10% per share annually through 2028. Its development pipeline is a major power source, likely supplying 3% to 5% FFO per-share growth each year. The Microsoft deal could enable Brookfield Renewable to deliver higher-end growth from its development pipeline starting in 2026 while extending its growth outlook to 2030. \nThe agreement should enhance Brookfield's ability to grow its dividend in the future. The company expects to increase its already attractive payout (currently yielding over 6%) by 5% to 9% annually over the long term. It has delivered 6% compound annual dividend growth over the last two decades and could grow the payout toward the upper end of its yearly target range in the coming years, partly powered by the Microsoft deal. \nMicrosoft's massive renewable energy purchase agreement with Brookfield will help power the company's rapidly growing cloud business with clean energy. That will help accelerate the energy transition to cleaner power, which is great for the environment. \nOn top of that, the deal will help accelerate Brookfield's growth, which could pay big dividends for its shareholders in the coming years. Brookfield Renewable's combination of income and growth could power strong total returns for its investors, making it a top renewable energy stock to buy. \nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Alice Nunwick ",
        "Text": "Microsoft was an early backer of OpenAI, investing $1bn in the startup in 2019. Now, with reports that it is training an AI model bigger than Google Gemini, will Microsoft\u2019s investment in AI finally pay off?\nNews of Microsoft\u2019s new in-house AI model, named MAI-1, was first reported by The Information on 6 May citing people familiar with the matter. MAI-1 is reported to have 500 billion parameters and its development is overseen by Mustafa Suleyman, former CEO of AI development company Inflection and Google DeepMind\u2019s cofounder. A use case for MAI-1 has not yet been publicly disclosed.\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini and Gemini Pro, in comparison, consist of two and seven billion parameters respectively.\nWhile MAI-1 was not first developed by Google DeepMind, The Information reported that its training data may have been built from the startup.\nMicrosoft first hired Suleyman as the CEO of Microsoft AI in March 2024 in an attempt to establish dominance in its AI-related hiring. Suleyman has since been Microsoft\u2019s lead in all of its AI consumer products, including Copilot and Bing. Prior to joining Microsoft, Suleyman worked at DeepMind for over 9 years.\nAI talent is becoming increasingly scarce as companies race to develop their own models, leading to talent poaching and cases of acqui-hiring, the process of acquiring a company primarily for its workforce.\nOutside of hiring key AI players, Microsoft first got its head start by investing heavily into OpenAI according to a report from research and analysis company GlobalData.\nIn its 2024 executive briefing into AI, GlobalData reported that Microsoft\u2019s extended partnership and $10bn total investment in OpenAI granted it significant leeway to dominating the generative AI space.\nThis relationship with OpenAI has enabled Microsoft to leverage its GPT large language model (LLM) into Microsoft products like Bing and Edge. However, Microsoft also provides users access to LLMs and other AI models through its Azure service.\nHowever, The Information\u2019s report stated that MAI-1 was also intended to be in competition with OpenAI, potentially signalling a future independent Microsoft AI model that it could monetise without the need for GPT.\nChief product and technology officer at software company xDesign, Jeff Watkins, questioned whether Microsoft would really seek total independence from GPT.\n\u201cAt 500 billion parameters, this will be Microsoft\u2019s largest home-grown model, but still behind OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 which is reportedly 1 trillion plus parameter,\u201d he stated.\n\u201cOne might question why they\u2019re doing this, given their existing alliances, and there\u2019s several potential reasons, firstly being the ongoing regulatory challenges with their potential over-investment into OpenAI,\u201d Watkins explained, referring to an in-depth review of Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI investment by the EU announced in January.\n\u201cAn organisation the size of Microsoft likely is nervous of not having full ownership of their destiny in this field,\u201d Watkins continued, \u201cThis move means that Microsoft has their own skin in the game, in-house, which will remain their own IP, no matter the outcomes of their dealings with OpenAI.\u201d\nWatkins maintained that, if true, the release of MAI-1 would be an impressive step for Microsoft in AI.\n\u201cBut will this pay off for them? I think it will, and sooner than you\u2019d imagine,\u201d he concluded, \u201cIt won\u2019t necessarily be through consumer use directly, but through integration into their products and services, allowing them to specialise the model (or models) to meet their needs, unconstrained.\u201d\nBig Tech companies have already begun attempts to establish independence in AI chips, with Meta, Google and Intel all releasing AI chips during the same week in early April.\nMicrosoft itself released two AI specific chips in November 2023, the Azure Maia AI Accelerator and Azure Cobalt CPU. The chips were the first custom AI chip designed by AI and were designed in-house.\nAnnouncing the chips, Microsoft did not state how they compared to Nvidia\u2019s leading H100 chips currently used in the training of many forefront AI models. However, it did specify a desire to diversify its chip supply chain.\nThe BBC reported in 2023 that ChatGPT required around 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs to run and answer user prompts.\nGlobalData previously forecast that the global AI race would pivot to become an AI chips arms race, suggesting that more AI developers would seek to develop their own hardware to prevent dependence on Nvidia and future chip shortages.\nChief analyst and practice lead at GlobalData, Rena Bhattacharyya, explained MAI-1's impact on Microsoft\u2019s future lead.\n\u201c[MAI-1] positions Microsoft as an innovator in the generative AI space and ensures that the hyperscale cloud provider remains a front runner in what is becoming an increasingly competitive market,\u201d she begins, \u201cMicrosoft is wise to offer customers a range of model options since in the future, businesses will embrace a multi-model environment to optimise performance and cost.\u201d\nBhattacharyya explained that a future release of a large AI model like MAI-1 would complement Microsoft\u2019s existing small AI model offerings, like its Phi-3 suite of models.\n\u201cBy offering a mix of large language models and small language models, Microsoft ensures it can meet a range of customer requirements and thereby reduce customer churn,\u201d she said.\n\"Analysis: Will Microsoft\u2019s AI investment pay off?\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Akshat Rathi and Dina Bass ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- When Microsoft Corp. pledged four years ago to remove more carbon than it emits by the end of the decade, it was one of the most ambitious and comprehensive plans to tackle climate change. Now the software giant's relentless push to be the global leader in artificial intelligence is putting that goal in peril.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site\nHims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy\nSpeedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge\nJamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is \u2018Well on the Way\u2019\nOne of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks\nThe Seattle-based company\u2019s total planet-warming impact is about 30% higher today than it was in 2020, according to the latest sustainability report published Wednesday. That makes getting to below zero by 2030 even harder than it was when it announced its carbon-negative goal.\nNow to meet its goals, the software giant will have to make serious progress very quickly in gaining access to green steel and concrete and less carbon-intensive chips, said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg Green. \u201cIn 2020, we unveiled what we called our carbon moonshot. That was before the explosion in artificial intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in many ways the moon is five times as far away as it was in 2020, if you just think of our own forecast for the expansion of AI and its electrical needs.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s predicament is one of the first concrete examples of how the pursuit of AI is colliding with efforts to cut emissions. Choosing to capitalize on its early lead in the new market for generative AI has made Microsoft the most valuable company in the world, but its leaders also acknowledge keeping up with demand will mean investing more heavily in polluting assets.\nAI products are power hungry and data-processing heavy. That first increases the workload of existing centers, which increases energy use. But such is the demand that, to keep up, Microsoft has to also build new data centers. That requires carbon-intensive cement, steel and microchips.\nThe tech giant plans to spend more than $50 billion between July 2023 and June of this year on expanding its data centers to meet rising demand for AI products. That number for the next 12 months, starting in July, is expected to be even higher, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview last month. Since February, the company has touted new data center projects in Wisconsin, Thailand, Indonesia, Spain, Germany and Japan.\nSmith believes the good AI can do for the world will outweigh its environmental impact. \u201cWe fundamentally believe that the answer is not to slow down the expansion of AI but to speed up the work needed to make it more environmentally friendly,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI guarantee there\u2019s one way to fail: It\u2019s to give up.\u201d\nSome Microsoft employees are speaking out about the company\u2019s other AI-related work to enhance oil extraction. More than 10,000 employees have formed a group that wants Microsoft to reduce its global warming impact, and some have quit in protest. \u201cWork to maximize oil production with our technology is negating all of our good work, extending the age of fossil fuels, and enabling untold emissions,\u201d wrote two former employees. \u201cWe are both deeply saddened to be so let down by a company we loved so much.\u201d\n\u201cEmployees around the world are core to our sustainability mission,\u201d a spokesperson for Microsoft said in response. \u201cOur focus is empowering the energy transition.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t a challenge for Microsoft alone. Its competitors in the AI race are Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.\u2014companies that all set ambitious climate goals but have seen their total emissions increase.\nIn response to questions, a Google spokesperson said that predicting increase in energy use and emissions tied to AI is hard and said the company is trying reduce the company\u2019s environmental impact by increasing deployment of clean energy and buying credits for carbon removal, among other steps. An Amazon spokesperson said \u201cwe remain committed\u201d to reaching net-zero by 2040 and touted its work on enabling new clean energy sources, including nuclear. Meta did not respond.\nDespite AI's ravenous energy consumption, this actually contributes little to Microsoft's hike in emissions \u2014 at least on paper. That's because the company says in its sustainability report that it's 100% powered by renewables.\nCompanies use a range of mechanisms to make such claims, which vary widely in terms of credibility. Some firms enter into long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable developers, where they shoulder some of a new energy plant's risk and help get new solar and wind farms online. In other cases, companies buy renewable energy credits (RECs) to claim they're using green power, but these inexpensive credits do little to spur new demand for green energy, researchers have consistently found.\nMicrosoft uses a mix of both approaches. On one hand, it's one of the biggest corporate participants in power purchase agreements, according to BloombergNEF, which tracks these deals. But it's also a huge purchaser of RECs, using these instruments to claim about half of its energy use is clean, according to its environmental filings in 2022. By using a large quantity of RECs, Microsoft is essentially masking an even larger growth in emissions.\n\u201cIt is Microsoft\u2019s plan to phase out the use of unbundled RECs in future years,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said. \u201cWe are focused on PPAs as a primary strategy.\u201d\nSo what else can be done? Smith, along with Microsoft\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa, has laid out clear steps in the sustainability report. High among them is to increase efficiency, which is to use the same amount of energy or computing to do more work. That could help reduce the need for data centers, which will reduce emissions and electricity use. On most things, \u201cour climate goals require that we spend money,\u201d said Smith. \u201cBut efficiency gains will actually enable us to save money.\u201d\nMicrosoft has also been at the forefront of buying sustainable aviation fuels that has helped reduce some of its emissions from business travel. The company also wants to partner with those who will \u201caccelerate breakthroughs\u201d to make greener steel, concrete and fuels. Those technologies are starting to work at a small scale, but remain far from being available in commercial quantities even if expensive.\nCheap renewable power has helped make Microsoft\u2019s climate journey easier. But the tech giant\u2019s electricity consumption last year rivaled that of a small European country\u2014beating Slovenia easily. Smith said that one of the biggest bottlenecks for it to keep getting access to green power is the lack of transmission lines from where the power is generated to the data centers. That\u2019s why Microsoft says it\u2019s going to increase lobbying efforts to get governments to speed up building the grid.\nDespite all these efforts, what if Microsoft\u2019s emissions remain high in 2029? Smith said that bulk purchases of carbon removal credits \u201cis always a possibility, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the desired course.\u201d\nThere are a myriad ways to remove carbon dioxide from the air\u2014from devices with large fans and industrial chemicals to planting trees. But these credits carry a premium price, many times more than $100 per ton that Microsoft applies as an internal carbon tax on its business travel.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be willing to invest and pay for it,\u201d said Smith. Climate change is \u201ca problem that humanity created and that humanity can solve.\u201d\n--With assistance from Ben Elgin.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "Text": "Stocks can help you retire rich. Not as in \"get rich quick,\" but steady compounders that slowly and surely make you money for decades. Those companies are challenging to find. To help in your search, know that technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of them.\nHow do I know? Well, past performance does provide some indication (although it's no guarantee of future performance). A $10,000 investment made in Microsoft in 1986 would be worth over $70 million today.\nNaturally, such strong past results beg the question: Is there juice left to squeeze from this stock?\nHere is why Microsoft can still, despite its massive size and success, help you retire a millionaire.\nMicrosoft sustained success over decades by squarely inserting itself into every significant technology breakthrough, ranging from enterprise software with Windows and Microsoft Office to cloud computing and now artificial intelligence (AI). Research by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that AI will create over $15 trillion in economic value by the decade's end. Microsoft has clear early competitive advantages in capturing its share of that added value.\nFor starters, Microsoft has a financial relationship with OpenAI, the AI developer that created ChatGPT. Among the terms of their partnership is the requirement that OpenAI's computing needs run through Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform. This could funnel a lot of cloud activity to Microsoft as AI grows.\nAdditionally, Microsoft is already a data center powerhouse thanks to its Azure business. The company has an estimated 160 data centers across 60 regions worldwide, a global network of computing power that can take on the demanding workload that AI has and will create in the future.\nPlus, it's not like Microsoft is a one-trick AI pony. The potential upside of AI is the icing on the cake. Azure is already the world's second-largest cloud platform behind Amazon's AWS. The Windows and Office software ecosystem that built the modern Microsoft is still arguably as dominant today as it was two decades ago.\nDo you want a years-long growth track record? Just feast your eyes below:\nNow approaching a quarter-trillion in annual revenue, Microsoft may eventually struggle to continue increasing in size. However, the business is so profitable that it could easily drive per-share metrics higher for the foreseeable future (more on that below). Analysts still peg Microsoft to grow earnings by an average of 16% annually over the next three to five years.\nMicrosoft could flex its muscles to shareholders in the per-share financials. The company is raking over $70 billion in annual free cash flow. Free cash flow accounts for capital spending, so that's all discretionary cash that can go to shareholders or the balance sheet.\nYou can see that Microsoft has augmented per-share earnings by aggressively retiring stock for years. Additionally, Microsoft has paid a dividend and increased it for 22 consecutive years. Despite the increases, the payout is only 30% of Microsoft's cash flow, which gives management plenty of financial flexibility.\nMicrosoft's anticipated mid-teens-percentage earnings growth outlook strongly indicates solid investment returns ahead. At that rate, Microsoft's earnings would double every four to five years, pushing the share price higher, even if some air comes from the stock's valuation.\nUnless Microsoft's business dries up, it's hard to see this recipe of share repurchases and dividend growth failing for the foreseeable future. The stock's market cap may not grow as fast, but per-share financials look poised to carry the onus of generating investment results.\nMicrosoft's massive size and trajectory are what you get when a stellar company finds its way into several massive markets and remains on top for prolonged periods. AI looks like the next chapter in Microsoft's great story, which bodes well for aspiring millionaire investors. It may not get investors there all on its own, but it will help.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "IEN ",
        "Text": "Microsoft yesterday unveiled a broad investment package designed to make Southeast Wisconsin a hub for AI-powered economic activity, innovation and job creation.\nThe investments include $3.3 billion in cloud computing and AI infrastructure, the first manufacturing-focused AI co-innovation lab in the U.S., and an AI skilling initiative to train more than 100,000 residents with essential AI skills.\nPresident Joe Biden joined Microsoft President Brad Smith at Gateway Technical College to announce the new investment.\nMost Read on IEN:\nHow the De Minimis Loophole Has Crippled Industries\nToxic Ingredients Found in Weight Loss Supplements\nHeineken Uproots Huge Apple Orchard as Cider Sales Slip\nRaccoon Knocks Out Electricity for Thousands in Wisconsin\nIn a statement, Smith said Wisconsin has a rich manufacturing legacy of innovation and ingenuity. Now, he wants to use AI to help advance the next generation of manufacturing companies, skills and jobs. \"This is what a big company can do to build a strong foundation for every medium, small and startup company and nonprofit everywhere,\" Smith added.\nMicrosoft will roll out the investments in a four-part strategy. First, the company will invest $3.3 billion by the end of 2026 to expand national cloud and AI infrastructure capacity by developing a state-of-the-art data center campus in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin.\nMount Pleasant was the site of the much-ballyhooed Foxconn project that never came to fruition in the state. While the company does have a small footprint in the state, it's a fraction of the initial promise to invest $10 billion and create 13,000 jobs.\nMicrosoft's project should bring 2,300 union construction jobs to the area by 2025 and provide long-term employment opportunities over the next several years. The new infrastructure will help companies in Wisconsin and across the country develop, deploy and use advanced cloud services and AI applications to grow, modernize and improve products and enterprises.\nMicrosoft has partnered with National Grid to build a new 250-megawatt solar project in Wisconsin that will begin operating in 2027. The additional solar power means that by 2027, Microsoft will exceed 4,000 megawatts of power flowing into the local grid, enough to power more than 3 million homes. Microsoft and National Grid will also jointly contribute $20 million over the term of the agreement to a community fund to support under-resourced communities and communities disproportionately impacted by pollution.\nThe new data center will use recycled water via a closed-loop cooling system that does not require additional water after startup. This is a major step towards sustainability and responsible resource management. A relatively small portion of the facility will use water for cooling, but only when the temperature outside is very warm.\nAlong with building a physical data center, Microsoft will partner with Gateway Technical College to build a Data Center Academy to train and certify more than 1,000 students in five years to work in the new data center and IT sector jobs created in the area.\nGovernor Tony Evers said, \"This is a watershed moment for Wisconsin and a critical part of our work to build a 21st-century workforce and economy in the Badger State. Evers said, \"Microsoft is a blue-chip corporation that recognizes the strength of Wisconsin's workers, infrastructure, economy and our quality of life.\"\nIn the second phase, Microsoft will build a manufacturing-focused AI Co-Innovation Lab on the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee campus. It will be the first of its kind in the U.S. The lab will connect Wisconsin manufacturers and other companies with Microsoft's AI experts and developers to design and prototype AI and cloud solutions to improve and accelerate their work and grow their business. The lab will aim to serve 270 Wisconsin companies by 2030, including 135 manufacturing businesses.\nThe third phase will see Microsoft partner with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners to upskill more than 100,000 people across Wisconsin on generative AI by 2030. The curriculum will help train residents to use new applications, including Microsoft Copilot, a suite of Microsoft AI services that enhance productivity and creativity.\nMicrosoft will also work with Gateway Technical College to train and certify 3,000 additional AI software developers and provide opportunities for 1,000 local business, civic and government leaders to participate in immersive boot camps to learn how to adopt generative AI into their organizations effectively.\nFinally, Microsoft will invest in long-term local education and youth employment programs. In partnership with the Racine Unified School District (RUSD), Microsoft will work with Girls in STEM to expand its program to two additional RUSD middle schools. The expansion will provide more than 500 middle school-aged girls access to STEM education over the next five years.\nWorking with Racine County, Microsoft will support their Summer Youth Employment Program, matching at least 125 young people (16-18 years old) with local employers to receive soft skills and on-the-job training annually.\nMicrosoft will also continue distributing Equity Through Technology and STEAM Grant Funds to the more than 12,000 people across Racine County engaged in United Way programs. Announced in 2023, these grants help local nonprofits address disparities and support under-resourced communities through technology.\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking manufacturing industry news.\n"

In exchange, Microsoft got the right to reuse OpenAI\u2019s models and became a minority holder specifically in the profit-making part of OpenAI\u2019s business which, in turn, is \u201clegally bound to pursue the Nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d\nThat arrangement gives OpenAI some unusual powers. According to OpenAI, its nonprofit board will determine when the company has \u201cattained AGI,\u201d or artificial general intelligence\u2014the point at which AI finally outperforms humans at \"economically valuable work.\" Once the board decides AGI has been reached, such a system will be \u201cexcluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft.\" Translation: Once OpenAI achieves its stated mission of reaching AGI, Microsoft will presumably not have access to or be able to profit from OpenAI's AGI-level technology.\nIssues around OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit board came to a head when it suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman\u2014and then quickly reinstated him\u2014in November 2023. Before his ouster, Altman said he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were \u201cnowhere near the frenemy territory,\u201d saying the relationship was \u201creally good.\u201d\nBut recent developments leave me wondering whether the Big Tech behemoth and the $80 billion startup are becoming full-on frenemies. After all, Nadella was blindsided by Altman\u2019s ouster, learning of it just minutes before the rest of the world. And on a joint episode of the Pivot and On with Kara Swisher podcasts during the Altman drama, he said, \u201cOne thing, I\u2019ll be very, very clear, is we\u2019re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this, ever again.\u2026 That\u2019s done.\u201d\nThese days, Microsoft is clearly hedging its bets: Less than two months ago, Microsoft announced it was forming a new organization, called Microsoft AI, with Mustafa Suleyman, founder of DeepMind and cofounder of Inflection AI, as its CEO. Microsoft also paid $650 million for the rights to Inflection\u2019s intellectual property. And yesterday, The Information reported that Microsoft is readying a new, massive, state-of-the-art AI model to compete with OpenAI (as well as Google and Anthropic). The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by Suleyman.\nMeanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s Altman appears less focused on the part of the business that benefits Microsoft, and more on the company\u2019s relentless pursuit to reach AGI. Addressing students at Stanford University last week, he honed in on his belief that any cost in support of that mission is justified.\n\u201cThere is probably some more business-minded person than me at OpenAI somewhere worried about how much we\u2019re spending, but I kinda don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether we burn $500 million a year or $5 billion\u2014or $50 billion a year\u2014I don\u2019t care, I genuinely don\u2019t,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs long as we can figure out a way to pay the bills, we\u2019re making AGI. It\u2019s going to be expensive.\u201d\nWhether Microsoft will keep investing in OpenAI towards that mega-cost, ill-defined mission remains to be seen. After all, according to an internal email released last week as part of the ongoing U.S. Justice Department antitrust case against Google, Microsoft initially invested in OpenAI in 2019 because it was \u201cvery worried\u201d that Google was years ahead in scaling up its AI efforts.\n\u201cWe are multiple years behind the competition in terms of machine learning scale,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s CTO Kevin Scott wrote in the 2019 email to Nadella and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.\nNow, of course, Microsoft is seen as a clear AI leader. Nadella, for his part, appears to be shrewd at playing a multidimensional chess game meant to make sure the company does not fall behind again in AI. At the same time, the OpenAI drama continues: OpenAI is said to be planning the release of an AI-powered search product similar to Perplexity and competitive with Google. But just this morning, The Information reported that OpenAI may postpone an event where its leaders were expected to share updates and show product demonstrations\u2014though it is unclear what the event was about.\nSo, are Microsoft and OpenAI full-on frenemies at this point? Or will the Nadella-Altman bromance continue? As recently as January, the two showed a united front in a discussion at Davos about their partnership. But either way, it looks like Microsoft isn\u2019t taking any chances.\nWith that, here\u2019s the AI news.\nSharon Goldmansharon.goldman@fortune.com@sharongoldman\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Now, with reports that it is training an AI model bigger than Google Gemini, will Microsoft\u2019s investment in AI finally pay off?\nNews of Microsoft\u2019s new in-house AI model, named MAI-1, was first reported by The Information on 6 May citing people familiar with the matter. MAI-1 is reported to have 500 billion parameters and its development is overseen by Mustafa Suleyman, former CEO of AI development company Inflection and Google DeepMind\u2019s cofounder. A use case for MAI-1 has not yet been publicly disclosed.\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini and Gemini Pro, in comparison, consist of two and seven billion parameters respectively.\nWhile MAI-1 was not first developed by Google DeepMind, The Information reported that its training data may have been built from the startup.\nMicrosoft first hired Suleyman as the CEO of Microsoft AI in March 2024 in an attempt to establish dominance in its AI-related hiring. Suleyman has since been Microsoft\u2019s lead in all of its AI consumer products, including Copilot and Bing. Prior to joining Microsoft, Suleyman worked at DeepMind for over 9 years.\nAI talent is becoming increasingly scarce as companies race to develop their own models, leading to talent poaching and cases of acqui-hiring, the process of acquiring a company primarily for its workforce.\nOutside of hiring key AI players, Microsoft first got its head start by investing heavily into OpenAI according to a report from research and analysis company GlobalData.\nIn its 2024 executive briefing into AI, GlobalData reported that Microsoft\u2019s extended partnership and $10bn total investment in OpenAI granted it significant leeway to dominating the generative AI space.\nThis relationship with OpenAI has enabled Microsoft to leverage its GPT large language model (LLM) into Microsoft products like Bing and Edge. However, Microsoft also provides users access to LLMs and other AI models through its Azure service.\nHowever, The Information\u2019s report stated that MAI-1 was also intended to be in competition with OpenAI, potentially signalling a future independent Microsoft AI model that it could monetise without the need for GPT.\nChief product and technology officer at software company xDesign, Jeff Watkins, questioned whether Microsoft would really seek total independence from GPT.\n\u201cAt 500 billion parameters, this will be Microsoft\u2019s largest home-grown model, but still behind OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 which is reportedly 1 trillion plus parameter,\u201d he stated.\n\u201cOne might question why they\u2019re doing this, given their existing alliances, and there\u2019s several potential reasons, firstly being the ongoing regulatory challenges with their potential over-investment into OpenAI,\u201d Watkins explained, referring to an in-depth review of Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI investment by the EU announced in January.\n\u201cAn organisation the size of Microsoft likely is nervous of not having full ownership of their destiny in this field,\u201d Watkins continued, \u201cThis move means that Microsoft has their own skin in the game, in-house, which will remain their own IP, no matter the outcomes of their dealings with OpenAI.\u201d\nWatkins maintained that, if true, the release of MAI-1 would be an impressive step for Microsoft in AI.\n\u201cBut will this pay off for them? I think it will, and sooner than you\u2019d imagine,\u201d he concluded, \u201cIt won\u2019t necessarily be through consumer use directly, but through integration into their products and services, allowing them to specialise the model (or models) to meet their needs, unconstrained.\u201d\nBig Tech companies have already begun attempts to establish independence in AI chips, with Meta, Google and Intel all releasing AI chips during the same week in early April.\nMicrosoft itself released two AI specific chips in November 2023, the Azure Maia AI Accelerator and Azure Cobalt CPU. The chips were the first custom AI chip designed by AI and were designed in-house.\nAnnouncing the chips, Microsoft did not state how they compared to Nvidia\u2019s leading H100 chips currently used in the training of many forefront AI models. However, it did specify a desire to diversify its chip supply chain.\nThe BBC reported in 2023 that ChatGPT required around 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs to run and answer user prompts.\nGlobalData previously forecast that the global AI race would pivot to become an AI chips arms race, suggesting that more AI developers would seek to develop their own hardware to prevent dependence on Nvidia and future chip shortages.\nChief analyst and practice lead at GlobalData, Rena Bhattacharyya, explained MAI-1's impact on Microsoft\u2019s future lead.\n\u201c[MAI-1] positions Microsoft as an innovator in the generative AI space and ensures that the hyperscale cloud provider remains a front runner in what is becoming an increasingly competitive market,\u201d she begins, \u201cMicrosoft is wise to offer customers a range of model options since in the future, businesses will embrace a multi-model environment to optimise performance and cost.\u201d\nBhattacharyya explained that a future release of a large AI model like MAI-1 would complement Microsoft\u2019s existing small AI model offerings, like its Phi-3 suite of models.\n\u201cBy offering a mix of large language models and small language models, Microsoft ensures it can meet a range of customer requirements and thereby reduce customer churn,\u201d she said.\n\"Analysis: Will Microsoft\u2019s AI investment pay off?\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Vardah Gill ",
        "Text": "Dividend stocks are in the limelight this year as many tech companies have joined the dividend club since the start of 2024. In addition to this, global companies have distributed a record amount in dividends last year. Retail investors are always on the lookout for income stocks. For this reason, we have analyzed the 15 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Reddit in a new article. In this article we are going to take a look at whether Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the best quality dividend stock to buy according to Reddit.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based multinational technology company that is mainly known for its Windows operating systems. In addition to this, the company also offers a wide range of services through its cloud-computing platform. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the most popular company among elite funds at the end of Q4 2023, with 302 hedge funds holding stakes in the company, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The collective value of these stakes is over $87.3 billion.\ndrserg / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has revolutionized both personal and business computing with its products for the software industry. The company\u2019s Azure cloud computing platform is widely gaining momentum among business professionals. Its revenue from cloud services is a significant contributor to its total earnings. In the company\u2019s most recent quarter, it reported a 23% year-over-year growth in its cloud revenue at over $35 billion.\nVulcan Value Partners mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software company with a broad range of offerings including Microsoft office, gaming, Azure cloud computing, LinkedIn, and more. It was a material contributor for the second consecutive quarter, and we discussed it at length in last quarter\u2019s letter. The company continues to execute well.\u201d\nWhere tech companies mainly prefer reinvesting profits into growth and innovation, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) changed the paradigm and initiated its dividend policy in 2003 with a per-share dividend of $0.08. The company has been growing its payouts for the past 18 consecutive years, currently offering a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. In addition to this, the company\u2019s 5-year average dividend growth rate comes in at 10.23%. With a payout ratio of 25.3%, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s dividend is also sustainable. This means that the company distributes less than one-third of its profits to shareholders as dividends.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced its fiscal Q3 2024 earnings and reported revenue of roughly $61.8 billion, which showed a 17% growth from the same period last year. The revenue not only showed growth but also beat analysts\u2019 estimates by $1.01 billion. Its operating income amounted to $27.6 billion, up 23% from the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the company generated $32 billion in operating cash flow, up from $24.4 billion in the prior year period. The company\u2019s solid cash position enabled it to uphold its commitment to shareholders by returning $8.4 billion to them through dividends and share repurchases in Q3 2024.\nWhile Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) dividend is strong and sustainable, the stock\u2019s dividend yield tends to come up short when compared to some other high-yield dividend stocks in the market. As of May 18, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.71%, which is less than a 1.3% yield for the S&P 500. The low dividend yield does not satisfy income investors, who seek regular income on their dividend investments. The stock can be added to a diversified dividend portfolio but this means missing out on other high-yield dividend stock opportunities.\nAccording to the Reddit community, Microsoft is currently offering strong financial health along with stable dividend growth. However, some Redditors expressed concerns about the stock being modestly overvalued. The stock is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 36.5x, which is seen as too high by some. Moreover, its competitive industry may push the company to prioritize capital expenditure over dividends to remain relevant.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is picked by Reddi readers as the best quality dividend stock due to its financial health and consistent dividend growth. That said, if you are concerned about its relatively low dividend yield and high valuation you should consider other high-yield dividend stocks on our list of the 15 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy or 5 Undervalued Stocks That Just Raised Their Dividends.

        "Author": "IEN ",
        "Text": "Microsoft yesterday unveiled a broad investment package designed to make Southeast Wisconsin a hub for AI-powered economic activity, innovation and job creation.\nThe investments include $3.3 billion in cloud computing and AI infrastructure, the first manufacturing-focused AI co-innovation lab in the U.S., and an AI skilling initiative to train more than 100,000 residents with essential AI skills.\nPresident Joe Biden joined Microsoft President Brad Smith at Gateway Technical College to announce the new investment.\nMost Read on IEN:\nHow the De Minimis Loophole Has Crippled Industries\nToxic Ingredients Found in Weight Loss Supplements\nHeineken Uproots Huge Apple Orchard as Cider Sales Slip\nRaccoon Knocks Out Electricity for Thousands in Wisconsin\nIn a statement, Smith said Wisconsin has a rich manufacturing legacy of innovation and ingenuity. Now, he wants to use AI to help advance the next generation of manufacturing companies, skills and jobs. \"This is what a big company can do to build a strong foundation for every medium, small and startup company and nonprofit everywhere,\" Smith added.\nMicrosoft will roll out the investments in a four-part strategy. First, the company will invest $3.3 billion by the end of 2026 to expand national cloud and AI infrastructure capacity by developing a state-of-the-art data center campus in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin.\nMount Pleasant was the site of the much-ballyhooed Foxconn project that never came to fruition in the state. While the company does have a small footprint in the state, it's a fraction of the initial promise to invest $10 billion and create 13,000 jobs.\nMicrosoft's project should bring 2,300 union construction jobs to the area by 2025 and provide long-term employment opportunities over the next several years. The new infrastructure will help companies in Wisconsin and across the country develop, deploy and use advanced cloud services and AI applications to grow, modernize and improve products and enterprises.\nMicrosoft has partnered with National Grid to build a new 250-megawatt solar project in Wisconsin that will begin operating in 2027. The additional solar power means that by 2027, Microsoft will exceed 4,000 megawatts of power flowing into the local grid, enough to power more than 3 million homes. Microsoft and National Grid will also jointly contribute $20 million over the term of the agreement to a community fund to support under-resourced communities and communities disproportionately impacted by pollution.\nThe new data center will use recycled water via a closed-loop cooling system that does not require additional water after startup. This is a major step towards sustainability and responsible resource management. A relatively small portion of the facility will use water for cooling, but only when the temperature outside is very warm.\nAlong with building a physical data center, Microsoft will partner with Gateway Technical College to build a Data Center Academy to train and certify more than 1,000 students in five years to work in the new data center and IT sector jobs created in the area.\nGovernor Tony Evers said, \"This is a watershed moment for Wisconsin and a critical part of our work to build a 21st-century workforce and economy in the Badger State. Evers said, \"Microsoft is a blue-chip corporation that recognizes the strength of Wisconsin's workers, infrastructure, economy and our quality of life.\"\nIn the second phase, Microsoft will build a manufacturing-focused AI Co-Innovation Lab on the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee campus. It will be the first of its kind in the U.S. The lab will connect Wisconsin manufacturers and other companies with Microsoft's AI experts and developers to design and prototype AI and cloud solutions to improve and accelerate their work and grow their business. The lab will aim to serve 270 Wisconsin companies by 2030, including 135 manufacturing businesses.\nThe third phase will see Microsoft partner with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners to upskill more than 100,000 people across Wisconsin on generative AI by 2030. The curriculum will help train residents to use new applications, including Microsoft Copilot, a suite of Microsoft AI services that enhance productivity and creativity.\nMicrosoft will also work with Gateway Technical College to train and certify 3,000 additional AI software developers and provide opportunities for 1,000 local business, civic and government leaders to participate in immersive boot camps to learn how to adopt generative AI into their organizations effectively.\nFinally, Microsoft will invest in long-term local education and youth employment programs. In partnership with the Racine Unified School District (RUSD), Microsoft will work with Girls in STEM to expand its program to two additional RUSD middle schools. The expansion will provide more than 500 middle school-aged girls access to STEM education over the next five years.\nWorking with Racine County, Microsoft will support their Summer Youth Employment Program, matching at least 125 young people (16-18 years old) with local employers to receive soft skills and on-the-job training annually.\nMicrosoft will also continue distributing Equity Through Technology and STEAM Grant Funds to the more than 12,000 people across Racine County engaged in United Way programs. Announced in 2023, these grants help local nonprofits address disparities and support under-resourced communities through technology.\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking manufacturing industry news.\n"

In Kuala Lumpur, he met Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before addressing business leaders and developers at a company event.\nThe investment is the biggest by Microsoft in its 32 years in Malaysia and underscores Microsoft\u2019s effort to emerge as a winner in Asia. Nadella has pledged at least $7 billion to build out the company\u2019s services from Japan to India, while touting AI as a growth engine and prodding countries to boost investment in the technology.\nIn Malaysia, the southern Johor Bahru region \u2014 connected by a causeway to Singapore \u2014 is emerging as one of Asia\u2019s rising AI data center hotspots.

Before closing, Arkane had planned to pitch a new single-player game in the Dishonored series, Bloomberg writes.\nJill Braff, head of ZeniMax studios, expressed hope that the reorganization would enable a greater focus on fewer projects, given the challenge of supporting nine studios worldwide with a lean central team.\nMicrosoft\u2019s gaming division has grown significantly through acquisitions, including ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, which have been worth over $76 billion combined.\nThe gaming sector has\u00a0recently experienced extensive layoffs, with significant companies like\u00a0Sony Group Corp\u00a0(NYSE:SONY),\u00a0Electronic Arts Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:EA), and Microsoft\u00a0reducing their workforces and shuttering subsidiaries.\nIn February,\u00a0Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs, mainly at Activision Blizzard.\nThe acquisition of Activision Blizzard has increased scrutiny on the Xbox division from Microsoft\u2019s leadership.\nLast week,\u00a0Take-Two Interactive Software Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TTWO)\u00a0announced it would close\u00a0two subsidiaries, Roll7 and Intercept Games, as part of widespread layoffs, affecting about 70 jobs.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) share price has soared 249% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Microsoft achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 21% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 28% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nWe know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Microsoft's TSR for the last 5 years was 266%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\nIt's good to see that Microsoft has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 31% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 30% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Microsoft better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Microsoft   you should know about.\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Microsoft managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Microsoft shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 41% to 45% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Microsoft's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\nOwing to the size of Microsoft, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. This comes in at 0.03% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.\nOne important encouraging feature of Microsoft is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Microsoft.\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) have popped 35% since May 2023, rallying investors with consistent growth across its business and an expanding position in artificial intelligence (AI).\nMicrosoft has come a long way since its founding nearly 50 years ago. The company is a king in software, attracting billions of users to products like Windows, its Office productivity suite, various Xbox offerings, LinkedIn, and its cloud platform Azure. The success of these products has catapulted Microsoft to being the world's most-valuable company, with a market cap above $3 trillion.\nHowever, recent developments indicate the company is still nowhere near hitting its ceiling. Microsoft has gotten a head start in AI that could see it surpass its rivals. Meanwhile, the tech giant is benefiting from the tailwinds of multiple other markets.\nSo, here's why Microsoft is a screaming buy right now.\nMicrosoft posted its third quarter of 2024 (ending March 2024) earnings on April 25. The company's revenue rose 17% year over year to $62 billion, beating analysts' expectations by more than $1 billion. Meanwhile, operating income climbed 23% to just under $28 billion.\nThe Windows company delivered double-digit growth in all of its segments. Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes division benefited from a spike in Office 365 commercial revenue, illustrating the potency of platforms like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, Outlook, and more. The company has become the go-to for businesses worldwide and could expand further in the industry as it introduces new AI features across its productivity lineup.\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft also enjoyed a 17% year-over-year rise in its More Personal Computing segment. The company attributed the growth to a 51% increase in gaming revenue. The boost comes after Microsoft's Xbox brand purchased game developer Activision Blizzard last October for a historic $68 billion.\nThe acquisition brought highly profitable game franchises like Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft into Microsoft's fold. Recent earnings indicate the purchase was a smart move, with the company having barely scratched the surface of what is possible with Activision's valuable game library.\nHowever, Microsoft's biggest growth catalysts going forward will likely be its cloud platform, Azure, as it continues to expand in AI.\nMicrosoft was an early investor in AI, providing $1 billion to ChatGPT developer OpenAI back in 2019. The company has since upped that investment to about $13 billion, granting Microsoft exclusive access to some of the industry's most advanced AI models.\nThe partnership allowed Microsoft a head start in the sector over rivals Amazon and Alphabet, which scrambled to catch up last year. As a result, Azure's cloud-market share has begun gaining on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest cloud platform. In Q4 2023, AWS lost 2% of its market share, while Azure gained 2%.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's Intelligence Cloud segment saw revenue increase by 21% year over year in its latest quarter, while AWS sales rose 17% during the same period.\nIn addition to new cloud services, Microsoft has gradually introduced AI features to many of its products. The company has integrated parts of ChatGPT into its search engine Bing, introduced generative features to platforms like Word and PowerPoint, and launched an AI assistant called Copilot to Microsoft 365. Copilot debuted last year as a $30 per-month add-on to a 365 subscription as the company moves to monetize its AI efforts.\nMicrosoft's stock is trading at nearly 36 times its earnings. However, with the same metric for Amazon at 41, Microsoft is at least a better bargain than its biggest cloud rival. Meanwhile, the chart above shows Microsoft has outperformed many of AI's most prominent players in free cash flow.\nThe figures indicate Microsoft is potentially best equipped to continue expanding in AI and overcome potential headwinds. Alongside promising growth in productivity software and gaming, Microsoft's stock is well worth its premium price and is a screaming buy right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "With 73% ownership of the shares, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Microsoft's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership\n Insiders have sold recently \nIf you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that Microsoft does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Microsoft, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Microsoft. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Microsoft Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.0b of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. \nWith a 27% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Microsoft. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Microsoft better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Microsoft has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The big story in the stock market over the past few years has been artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI, which can create text, images, videos, and audio, looks likely to be a transformative technology. Tech leaders like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices are betting heavily on AI to drive growth.\nWhile the stocks of all three of those AI-centric companies have surged over the past year, they have been beaten handily by a stock that has absolutely nothing to do with AI. Investing is about more than chasing buzzwords. The tried-and-true method of finding unappreciated companies with solid growth prospects trading at pessimistic valuations still works.\nThis mystery stock has more than doubled over the past year, beating all three of the aforementioned tech companies by large margins. It has also trounced Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD over the past three years, nearly tripling in that time.\nThe stock is Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ: SFM), a small chain of grocery stores that does things differently from the major supermarket chains. That strategy has been paying off, and Sprouts still has plenty of growth ahead as it expands its footprint.\nSprouts operated 414 stores in 23 states as of March 31. Each store is relatively small. Its older stores are around 30,000 square feet, while its newer stores are even smaller at approximately 23,000 square feet. While the size of traditional supermarkets varies, they're often substantially larger.\nKeeping its stores small reduces the cost of building new stores, lowers the ongoing operating costs, and allows Sprouts to build in locations where larger supermarkets wouldn't make sense. The average new store costs just $3.8 million. First-year sales average $13 million, with 20% to 25% annual growth over the following four years.\nSprouts focuses on two things: produce and attribute-based items. Each store features a large produce section with affordable prices. It makes a point to beat competitors on price.\nAbout 70% of the products Sprouts sells are attribute-based -- meaning gluten-free, organic, vegan, non-GMO, and the like. It doesn't try to compete with the big supermarket chains on selection, instead curating a differentiated assortment of products. This works well with the company's customer base, which skews toward the wealthy and college-educated.\nThe Sprouts model is working. Comparable-store sales (comps) were up 4% in the first quarter of this year, and the company expects 3% to 4% comps growth for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share will top $3 this year, according to the company's guidance, up from just $1.25 in 2019.\nSprouts will open 35 new stores this year. In 2025 and beyond, the company plans to increase its store count by about 10% annually. It sees opportunities to open more than 300 new stores in its expansion markets, which include Texas, California, Florida, and portions of the East Coast.\nBased on the company's guidance, the stock trades for about 25 times forward earnings even after the multiyear rally that has propelled shares to market-trouncing gains. With the company expecting 10% store growth, low single-digit comps growth, and stable profit margins, double-digit annual earnings growth is in the cards.\nThat valuation looks reasonable given the chain's growth potential. It could also be an acquisition target. Amazon snagged Whole Foods, another differentiated grocery chain, in 2017. Sprouts could be an attractive acquisition for a larger chain hunting for growth.\nThe grocery industry is tough, and consumer behavior can shift unexpectedly. Sprouts is navigating the post-pandemic environment well so far, and the company looks poised to greatly expand its footprint in the coming years. While the stock might not repeat its performance from the past few years, it looks like a solid long-term investment.\nBefore you buy stock in Sprouts Farmers Market, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sprouts Farmers Market wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Microsoft Is Outpacing Apple in Innovation and Growth",
        "Author": "  Oliver Rodzianko ",
        "Text": "I last covered Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) in December, and I allocated a buy rating to the stock. At this time, I believe it offers significantly stronger future price return potential and exposure to diversified innovation than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). I have, therefore, performed deeper research into the structural differences between the two companies. Therefore, this thesis provides a comparative analysis of the two companies to determine which has the highest competitive benefit moving forward.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nThere are distinct differences structurally between Microsoft and Apple, which contribute to why I think Apple may benefit from a slight readjustment at this time toward how Microsoft operates. Consider the following table:\nMicrosoft\nApple\nStructure\nProduct-based\nFunction-based\nDecisions\nSemi-autonomous\nHighly centralized\nProducts\nBroad portfolio\nIntegrated ecosystem\nCulture\nMatrix structure\nInnovation-driven\nSegments\nProduct lines\nFunctional areas\nI am not suggesting Apple become exactly like Microsoft, and in fact, much of what made Apple magical is its highly innovative ecosystem approach. In essence, it has been a culture of innovation since Steve Jobs founded it. However, without his genius, I think a more typical matrix structure would be well-received by shareholders at this time. That should not discount the importance of hiring the best talent for innovation, and I believe Apple has proven it still values this properly through its recent release of the Apple Vision Pro. However, let's not forget this product is nowhere near as revolutionary and popular as the iPhone was.\nWhat Microsoft has going for it is its semi-autonomous divisions, which act as separate entities with their own budgets and resources, allow for a more targeted and efficient allocation of capital. In turn, this can optimize the returns on investment. There is also a greater emphasis on diversification with Microsoft, reducing dependency on single products, markets or brands and spreading out financial risk.\nWhat I think Apple needs now is to balance the innovation it is known for with the financial prudence that has been developed over the long term by Bill Gates (Trades, Portfolio)' Microsoft, which I believe is more inspired by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) than by the radical creative approach of some other business leaders like Elon Musk and Jobs.\nThere are several areas that suggest Apple may be lagging behind Microsoft.\nFirst, in fiscal 2023, iPhone sales accounted for approximately 52% of Apple's total revenue. This heavy reliance on a single product made the company vulnerable to market saturation. In contrast, Microsoft's diverse revenue streams, including Office, LinkedIn, Azure, Windows, Surface and Xbox, mitigate this risk.\nMicrosoft Azure has been a key driver of growth for the company. The product's revenue grew by 27% in fiscal 2023. In contrast, Apple does not dominate the cloud market. It is, therefore, not exposed to the same growth potential.\nFurther, Apple also has lower research and development spending at this time. In fiscal 2023 it reported its R&D at about 7.80% of its total revenue. The same year, Microsoft reported R&D investments of around 12.80% of its total revenue. As its R&D investments are spread around multiple high-growth areas, this positions Microsoft for potentially higher levels of innovation and long-term growth.\nAlthough Apple is still one of the most valuable companies in the world, its market capitalization growth has been slower compared to Microsoft in recent years. Microsoft has less vulnerability due to its diversified approach and, at this time, its long-term prosperity looks to be stronger.\nThe company has been conservative with acquisitions, limiting its expansion into new markets. Microsoft, on the other hand, has made several high-profile acquisitions, including LinkedIn, GitHub and Activision Blizzard.\nApple and Microsoft are both strong companies, but the latter is proving itself to be more fiscally prudent, with a nature of strategic acquisitions and diversification, which arguably sustains its moat for longer and builds it wider than Apple's more localized approach.\nTo begin my comparative value analysis, please consider the following graph, which compares Microsoft and Apple's trailing 12-month price-earnings ratios.\nAs we can see, Apple is just slightly lower valued than Microsoft at this time. This is arguably justified based on the operations analysis I presented above. The good news is I do not think either company looks overvalued compared to the wider industry:\nCurrent P/E Ratio Without NRI\nMicrosoft\n37\nApple\n30\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n50\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n27\nMeta (NASDAQ:META)\n27\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n69\nIn many respects, Apple and Microsoft offer a fair valuation, but Microsoft has much better growth potential. Therefore, I believe Microsoft is the better investment at this time.\nBoth Microsoft and Apple trade above what I estimate as intrinsic value, which can be elucidated in the following table:\nMicrosoft\nApple\nCurrent EPS Without NRI\n$11.56\n$6.43\nForecasted EPS Without NRI CAGR 2024-2034\n15%\n10%\nForecasted EPS Without NRI CAGR 2034-2044\n7%\n5%\nDiscount Rate\n10%\n10%\nIntrinsic Value Estimate\n$304\n$114.50\nStock Price\n$428\n$190.70\nOvervaluation\n40.70%\n66.50%\nThe table does not indicate that both companies are actually overvalued, as the analysis needs to consider the sentiment analysis I performed above. I believe each stock is likely fairly valued. However, Microsoft offers better growth prospects, which significantly improves its outlook in a discounted earnings model.\nWhile this thesis clearly shows I believe Microsoft has a stronger future ahead of it than Apple at this time, there are significant risks that Microsoft is also going to have to navigate. One of the primary downsides that comes with the software company's diversified portfolio approach is that it may struggle with uniformity and integration risks, reducing the effectiveness of its overall ecosystem and potentially having a negative effect on the customer experience. This is what Jobs was clever in developing at Apple. Nonetheless, Microsoft could find its range of high-growth investments has a shorter half-life than a more integrated approach led by pioneering innovators. The issue here is I do not believe Apple has a Jobs equivalent at the helm at this time to continue to cultivate this direction of radical innovation to drive growth.\nIn addition, many innovators are not in the technology field for the money. In my opinion, the best talents are usually missionaries rather than capital allocators looking to profit from the stock. In essence, Microsoft could attract individuals who are more finance-oriented rather than creative, reducing the long-term magic fostered within the company over time and instead creating a less lucrative environment for technological advancement if it is not careful with how it sets up incentives and values within its culture.\nApple is struggling with Jobs no longer at the helm of the company. In this new era, I believe Apple needs to strategically redirect itself and take some inspiration from the way Microsoft structures itself. Apple could use a more expansive acquisition and investment strategy with an approach similar to a holding company being introduced.\nApple's markets are saturated, and its iPhone accounted for 52% of its total revenue in fiscal 2023. The company had almost half the R&D spend relative to revenue compared to Microsoft that year. Microsoft has a broader portfolio, where its diversification protects shareholder value and exposes investors to higher growth opportunities.\nMicrosoft performs better than Apple in my discounted earnings analysis, but I believe both companies to be fairly valued at this time. However, for investors seeking higher growth, Microsoft seems to be the stronger long-term investment.\nWhile Microsoft has a clever capital allocation strategy, it must be careful that it does not lose out on the best creative talent and that its customer experience does not suffer as a result of too much diversification and a loss of focus on the importance of ecosystem development.\nMicrosoft's prudent financial structure, which I believe was inspired by Buffett and adapted for the field of technology, places it in an incredibly strong position moving forward. Its diversified portfolio of investments exposes investors to higher levels of innovation and growth than Apple, in turn giving it a better valuation based on my discounted earnings analyses.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Dina Bass and Andrew Martin ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Facing harsh criticism for failing to contain several major cyberattacks, Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella sent a blunt message to his staff Friday urging them to make cybersecurity a top priority.\u201cIf you\u2019re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security,\u201d Nadella wrote in a companywide memo. \u201cIn some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems.\u201dNadella\u2019s memo came as Microsoft announced a series of new anti-hacking initiatives that include basing a portion of senior leaders\u2019 compensation on meeting cybersecurity milestones and adding cyber chiefs to its product groups.Microsoft has faced increasing scrutiny for its role in a number of high-profile hacks, and a government panel last month described the company\u2019s security culture as inadequate and in need of urgent reforms. Microsoft in November unveiled the Secure Future Initiative, its most significant security plan since co-founder Bill Gates halted Windows development in 2002 and ordered engineers to prioritize product safety over new features.But some rivals, government officials and customers have questioned whether the recent overhaul went far enough \u2014 and have called for Nadella to issue a memorandum that echoed Gates\u2019 missive.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial\nAmericans Are Racking Up \u2018Phantom Debt\u2019 That Wall Street Can\u2019t Track\nOne Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire\nTrump\u2019s Private Life Exposed in Intimate Stormy Daniels Testimony\nRead More: Microsoft Hack Woes Conjures Ghost of Gates Memo: Cyber Bulletin\n\u201cWe must and will do more,\u201d Microsoft security chief Charlie Bell wrote in a blog Friday. \u201cWe are making security our top priority at Microsoft, above all else \u2014 over all other features.\u201d As part of that, the company is expanding the scope of the Secure Future Initiative, he said, integrating recommendations from the government panel\u2019s report as well as lessons gleaned from a recent breach tied to Russian state-sponsored hackers.\nThe company\u2019s approach, Bell said, will be guided by three principles: security comes first when designing any product or service; security protections are enabled and enforced by default, requiring no extra effort and are not optional; and security controls and monitoring will be continuously improved to meet current and future threats.\u201cCulture can only be reinforced through our daily behaviors,\u201d Bell said. The deputy chief information security officers will report to Igor Tsyganskiy, who became global chief information security officer in December, one month after Microsoft announced its security overhaul.\nAnn Johnson, a Microsoft security executive since 2015, has been named deputy CISO for customer outreach and regulated industries and also will report to Tsyganskiy. Johnson\u2019s role will focus on \u201ccustomer engagement and communication about Microsoft\u2019s own security,\u201d the Redmond, Washington-based company said in an email.\nRead More: Microsoft, Beset by Hacks, Grapples With Problem Years in the Making\nEarly this year, a Russian state-sponsored group was blamed for combing through the email accounts of top Microsoft executives \u2014 prompting the company to reassign thousands of engineers to help mitigate the intrusion and accelerate security updates. In May 2023, a hacking gang linked to the Chinese government was accused of stealing one of Microsoft\u2019s access tools and using it to break into the email accounts of US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns and hundreds more.\nOn Friday, a German official said Russia-backed hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in Microsoft Outlook to breach government departments, companies and officials in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party.\nLast month, the US Cyber Safety Review Board issued a withering report documenting the company\u2019s inability to stop the China-linked hack and calling on Microsoft to institute urgent reforms. US Senator Ron Wyden introduced draft legislation on April 8 that would require the government to set mandatory security standards for collaboration software, citing Microsoft\u2019s \u201cshambolic cybersecurity.\u201d\nThe latest set of changes are meant to address the issue of how to give each product group a focus on security as they move to add new features and box out competitors in fields like artificial intelligence. Nadella said last week on a call with investors that the company is now \u201cputting security above all else.\u201d\n(Updates with quote from Satya Nadella memo in third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home\nTesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger\nThe Company Preaching America\u2019s Nuclear Revival\nBoom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That\u2019s a Good Thing\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) Can Still Rise Despite Sitting at the Top",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Numero Uno stock Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a $3 trillion market cap, has delivered a return of around 1,154% over the last decade. Sitting at the top of the global stock markets, will it continue to give similar returns in the next decade? I believe the answer is yes. Microsoft\u2019s consistently strong performance, cloud & AI-driven tailwinds, and robust margins despite substantial AI investments make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I\u2019ll take advantage of any market weakness in the coming months to purchase MSFT.\nOn April 25, Microsoft reported impressive Fiscal Q3 results for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all business segments. Q3\u00a0adjusted earnings of $2.94\u00a0per share handily beat analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.82 per share. Also, earnings jumped 20% year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.45 per share in the prior-year period.\nFurther, revenues soared 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion. The Intelligent Cloud business segment, encompassing Azure Cloud, SQL Server, and Windows, among others, grew 23% year-over-year to $26.7 billion, beating expectations yet again. The much-watched segment now comprises 35% of total revenues, with AI playing a significant role as a catalyst driving growth.\nWith the increasing adoption of AI by businesses, there is a substantial demand for Microsoft\u2019s Azure and related cloud services. Not surprisingly, Azure and other cloud services witnessed solid revenue growth of 31% (28% in constant currency), significantly surpassing Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\nDespite the strong Q3 performance, Microsoft provided a conservative outlook, slightly below expectations. Fiscal Q4 revenues are projected to be $64 billion compared to consensus expectations of $64.5 billion, with Azure revenues expected to grow between 30% and 31%.\nOn a positive note, Microsoft offered its FY2025 outlook, anticipating double-digit growth in both revenues and operating income. This forecast reassures investors of the company\u2019s sustained growth trajectory.\nAI has propelled Microsoft to become the largest stock in the world, and it will continue to be the driving force behind its growth story in the coming decade. Microsoft\u2019s early investment in OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has positioned it ahead of other tech giants.\nThe demand for AI remains insatiable, with Microsoft management stating that it exceeds available capacity. This high demand drives continuous heavy investment in AI by Microsoft and other tech titans.\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI investment plans align with those of its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the space. For instance, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported CAPEX (capital expenditures) of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0spent $6.72 billion.\u00a0Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\nIn the recent quarter, Microsoft reported a 22% sequential jump in CAPEX (including finance leases) to $14 billion versus $11.5 billion in the prior quarter. The majority of that amount is assigned to scaling its AI infrastructure and securing processors from Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) for running large AI models.\nIncreasing CAPEX may impact margins. However, Microsoft\u2019s management is taking the initiative to keep costs low and protect margins. For instance, newer and more efficient AI products like GPT-4o and Mai-1 are expected to increase scale and keep costs under control. Furthermore, Mai-1 will compete with major rivals, namely Google\u2019s Gemini and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nAzure AI Services, which includes AI training and other AI-related services, is experiencing remarkable growth. Azure competes directly with Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Google\u2019s cloud business and is closely watched by investors. Notably, Azure AI Services is now estimated to be an over\u00a0$4 billion run rate business. For comparison (although not a direct comparison), Amazon\u2019s AWS has reached a $100 billion annual run rate. This underscores the substantial opportunity for Azure powered by AI in the coming years.\nDuring the earnings call, management confirmed that Azure continues to gain market share, with 65% of Fortune 500 companies using Azure Open AI. There\u2019s a clear acceleration in Azure\u2019s growth, marked by the signing of large deals across several diverse industries, with names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) being added to its clientele. Azure will likely continue to see the growth momentum with increased market share gains in the coming months.\nFurther, Microsoft 365 Copilot (AI-backed online assistant) is showing steady adoption. Management stated that 60% of Fortune 500 companies now use the Copilot AI program. The company remains optimistic about its growing contribution to revenues in the coming years.\nIt\u2019s not just Azure and Copilot. Microsoft\u2019s AI investments and capabilities are expected to boost revenues and profitability across other product portfolios, such as GitHub, Fabric, and Security.\nOn a separate note, MSFT\u2019s acquisition of gaming software rival Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) will continue to add to MSFT\u2019s diversified revenue stream. Microsoft recently announced the unveiling of its own mobile store game, equivalent to Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store.\nDespite being the most valuable stock in the world, Microsoft\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t as expensive as one would think. At first glance, It may look expensive, trading at a forward P/E of 37x currently. Nonetheless, I believe the premium is justified, given its favorable industry-leading market position, robust margins, diversified revenue stream, and huge exposure to high-growth AI and cloud businesses.\nFor the sake of comparison, online retail and cloud computing giant Amazon is trading at a\u00a0P/E of 51x, while social networking company Meta Platforms is trading at a\u00a027x P/E.\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Microsoft stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the earnings report. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past month. Microsoft stock\u2019s average price target of $491.56 implies 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm, and Microsoft continues to lead the charge. Microsoft\u2019s early investments in AI have positioned it as a frontrunner in the industry, yielding significant rewards. I believe that Microsoft\u2019s GenAI innovations will continue to drive revenues, profits, and cash flows in the coming years.\nWith a long runway for growth and profitability ahead, Microsoft remains a compelling investment. I plan to keep adding MSFT to my portfolio, taking advantage of any market weaknesses in the coming months.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nMicrosoft is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $11.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +20%. This estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.18 indicates a change of +12% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $64.16 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $244.41 billion and $278.17 billion estimates indicate +15.3% and +13.8% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $61.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17%. EPS of $2.94 for the same period compares with $2.45 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $60.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.02%. The EPS surprise was +4.63%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 5.2% over the last month. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Microsoft's  ROE today.\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:\n34% = US$86b \u00f7 US$253b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.34 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Microsoft has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Microsoft's moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nAs a next step, we compared Microsoft's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 13% in the same period.\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MSFT? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. \nWith a three-year median payout ratio of 27% (implying that the company retains 73% of its profits), it seems that Microsoft is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.\nMoreover, Microsoft is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 22% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Microsoft's future ROE will be 29% which is again, similar to the current ROE.\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Microsoft's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

        "Title": "Could Microsoft Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Stocks can help you retire rich. Not as in \"get rich quick,\" but steady compounders that slowly and surely make you money for decades. Those companies are challenging to find. To help in your search, know that technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of them.\nHow do I know? Well, past performance does provide some indication (although it's no guarantee of future performance). A $10,000 investment made in Microsoft in 1986 would be worth over $70 million today.\nNaturally, such strong past results beg the question: Is there juice left to squeeze from this stock?\nHere is why Microsoft can still, despite its massive size and success, help you retire a millionaire.\nMicrosoft sustained success over decades by squarely inserting itself into every significant technology breakthrough, ranging from enterprise software with Windows and Microsoft Office to cloud computing and now artificial intelligence (AI). Research by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that AI will create over $15 trillion in economic value by the decade's end. Microsoft has clear early competitive advantages in capturing its share of that added value.\nFor starters, Microsoft has a financial relationship with OpenAI, the AI developer that created ChatGPT. Among the terms of their partnership is the requirement that OpenAI's computing needs run through Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform. This could funnel a lot of cloud activity to Microsoft as AI grows.\nAdditionally, Microsoft is already a data center powerhouse thanks to its Azure business. The company has an estimated 160 data centers across 60 regions worldwide, a global network of computing power that can take on the demanding workload that AI has and will create in the future.\nPlus, it's not like Microsoft is a one-trick AI pony. The potential upside of AI is the icing on the cake. Azure is already the world's second-largest cloud platform behind Amazon's AWS. The Windows and Office software ecosystem that built the modern Microsoft is still arguably as dominant today as it was two decades ago.\nDo you want a years-long growth track record? Just feast your eyes below:\nNow approaching a quarter-trillion in annual revenue, Microsoft may eventually struggle to continue increasing in size. However, the business is so profitable that it could easily drive per-share metrics higher for the foreseeable future (more on that below). Analysts still peg Microsoft to grow earnings by an average of 16% annually over the next three to five years.\nMicrosoft could flex its muscles to shareholders in the per-share financials. The company is raking over $70 billion in annual free cash flow. Free cash flow accounts for capital spending, so that's all discretionary cash that can go to shareholders or the balance sheet.\nYou can see that Microsoft has augmented per-share earnings by aggressively retiring stock for years. Additionally, Microsoft has paid a dividend and increased it for 22 consecutive years. Despite the increases, the payout is only 30% of Microsoft's cash flow, which gives management plenty of financial flexibility.\nMicrosoft's anticipated mid-teens-percentage earnings growth outlook strongly indicates solid investment returns ahead. At that rate, Microsoft's earnings would double every four to five years, pushing the share price higher, even if some air comes from the stock's valuation.\nUnless Microsoft's business dries up, it's hard to see this recipe of share repurchases and dividend growth failing for the foreseeable future. The stock's market cap may not grow as fast, but per-share financials look poised to carry the onus of generating investment results.\nMicrosoft's massive size and trajectory are what you get when a stellar company finds its way into several massive markets and remains on top for prolonged periods. AI looks like the next chapter in Microsoft's great story, which bodes well for aspiring millionaire investors.

        "Text": "Windows' Arm woes may finally be over. As part of the company's new Copilot+ AI PC initiative, which includes new Surfaces and partner systems running Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, Microsoft says it has rebuilt core components of Windows 11 to better support Arm-based hardware and AI. That includes a new kernel, compiler, and most importantly, an emulator named \"Prism\" for running older x86 and x64 apps.\nYou'd be forgiven for being skeptical, though. Since the launch of the Windows RT-powered Surface in 2012, Microsoft has proven it can't be trusted to deliver a decent OS experience on Arm. That device couldn't run legacy x86 apps (who would want to do that in Windows, right?), and it was far slower than PCs with Intel and AMD CPUs. Windows on Arm slowly improved over the years, to the point where it had serviceable emulation on the Surface Pro 9 5G. But that slate still couldn't keep up with its Intel-equipped sibling, especially when it struggled to emulate popular apps like Chrome.\nMicrosoft says it reworked Windows 11 schedulers to take advantage of Arm capabilities and AI workloads. There's also a new driver compute model that recognizes neural engines more like how Windows sees CPUs and GPUs, as well as AI APIs built directly into the OS. Basically, Arm hardware should no longer feel like an afterthought and developers should be able to tap into AI capabilities more easily.\n\"So, effectively, we're building binaries and windows that are optimized with certain workloads,\" Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft's head of Windows and Devices, said in a briefing with reporters earlier this month. \"The benefit for us for that is there are certain things that we know customers with Copilot+ PCs are going to do on an ongoing basis, and we can really focus on optimizing for those scenarios and making sure the machine responsiveness is a meaningful improvement.\"\nThanks to a powerful new Neural Processing Unit (NPU) in the Snapdragon X Elite chips, Copilot+ PCs can run more than 40 trillion operations per second, a measure of a chip\u2019s AI performance, more than four times the performance offered by today\u2019s AI PCs. Microsoft claims that this is twice the performance offered by Apple\u2019s MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.\nWhile Microsoft is pushing the availability of more native Arm apps for Windows 11, it's hard to deny the importance of supporting older software. That's where the Prism emulator comes in. Microsoft claims it improved the number of apps it supports, and that it's around 20 percent faster than its previous emulator. Any x86 and x64 apps that run under emulation with the Snapdragon X Elite Arm processors are more than twice as fast as previous generations of Windows that ran on Arm, Microsoft said in a blog post.\n\"When you combine the new Prism emulator with simply the raw performance and improvement in CPUs themselves, we're in a place where we have great native apps and we're also in a place where the breadth of the app catalog also has tremendous performance comparable to the rest of the Windows estate today,\" Davuluri said.\nThe NPU also lets Microsoft add AI-powered software features to Windows such as Recall, a new feature that uses AI to retrieve nearly anything you\u2019ve seen on your PC, something that Microsoft compares to giving your computer a photographic memory. Another feature called Live Captions offers instant and real-time translations from 44 languages into English across any video or audio playing on your PC.\nCatch up on all the news from Microsoft's Copilot AI and Surface event today!\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday debuted a host of new AI features during its Build conference in Seattle, including OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, a trio of small language models, and Microsoft\u2019s new Cobalt 100 CPU.\nThe announcements come as Silicon Valley turbocharges its AI investments and tech giants like Microsoft, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) race to outmaneuver one another during the biggest tech scramble in years.\nMicrosoft offering OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o through its Azure AI Studio was the company's biggest announcement on Tuesday.\nThe model, which OpenAI debuted during a live-streamed event last week, is multimodal and can understand inputs via text, audio, and video. That demo has since become embroiled in controversy after actress Scarlett Johansson on Monday demanded the company change the voice of its chatbot, which OpenAI featured answering questions.\nMicrosoft\u2019s news also comes a week after Google debuted a slew of AI products during its I/O developers conference, including a new version of Google Search with generative AI-based responses to users\u2019 queries.\nMicrosoft said users will now be able to develop their own copilots \u2014 essentially AI-powered programs \u2014 using GPT-4o to make apps that can respond to images, voice, and text. The Windows maker also said it will make its preview of Copilot in Azure available to all customers in the next couple of weeks.\nMicrosoft also showed off its Phi-3-small, Phi-3-medium, and Phi-3-vision small language models. Designed to run on devices, the Phi-3 models don\u2019t need to connect to the web, allowing users to access them in environments where they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to run cloud-based models like GPT-4o.\nPhi-3-vision is especially interesting, as it allows users to input images and text and then receive information about them via text outputs. So, for example, users will be able to do things like ask questions about charts, graphs, or images without needing to jump online.\nMicrosoft 365 is also getting copilot upgrades, with Copilot for Microsoft 365\u2019s new Team Copilot. The app, Microsoft says, can manage meeting agendas and take notes, summarize Teams chats and answer questions related to those conversations. The app can also track user deadlines and notify individual team members when they need to take action.\nIn addition to new software and developer capabilities, Microsoft also said it will begin previewing Azure virtual machines running on the company\u2019s new Arm-based Cobalt 100 cloud CPUs.\nVirtual machines are basically software-simulated versions of computers. So, instead of having to run 50 individual desktops, you can run 50 virtual machines on a high-powered server.\nMicrosoft claims that its Cobalt 100 chip provides 40% better performance than prior ARM-based virtual machine systems. In addition to the Cobalt 100 CPU, the company says it will begin offering AMD\u2019s (AMD) MI300X chip for developers looking to train and deploy AI apps.\nAll of this is part of Microsoft\u2019s effort to continue growing its cloud business through AI apps. Google and Amazon are using a similar strategy to expand their respective cloud empires as well, but Microsoft's multibillion-dollar investment in partner OpenAI has helped catapult the company to the top of the AI discussion.\nIn its most recent quarter, Microsoft said its AI products contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter.\nA year ago, Microsoft first broke out its AI percentage contributions to Azure, saying it added 1 percentage point to Azure revenue at the time.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

On Wednesday, he said Microsoft will build its first regional data center in Thailand.\nIn April, the tech giant similarly unveiled a $2.9 billion investment in Japan and $1.5 billion in G42, an AI firm in Abu Dhabi.\nMicrosoft also pledged to provide AI training for 2.5 million people in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam by 2025.\nNadella earlier met Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who said the investment will be the key support pillar for the government's goal to enhance AI capacity in Malaysia.\nThe new investment will include AI training for another 300,000 people, the establishment of a national AI center of excellence, enhancing the nation's cybersecurity capabilities and supporting the growth of Malaysia's developer community, Anwar said on Facebook.\nMicrosoft runs one of the world\u2019s largest cloud computing operations and has taken a leap into artificial intelligence through its partnership with OpenAI, developers of ChatGPT.\nSince then, Microsoft has integrated an AI assistant into its Microsoft Edge browser, named Copilot, helping lift its profits by 20% in the first quarter.\nMicrosoft sees Southeast Asia, with its population of over 600 million people, as a growing market and potential location for more AI product development. A study held by global consulting firm Kearney said AI could contribute nearly $1 trillion to Southeast Asia\u2019s GDP by 2030. Indonesia is expected to capture $366 billion of the total and Malaysia $115 billion.\nMicrosoft said in a statement that the investment in Malaysia will build on its 2021 program to support inclusive economic growth. It said the proposed national AI center will drive AI adoption across key industries and public sector, while ensuring AI governance and regulatory compliance.\n\u201cTogether with Microsoft, we look forward to creating more opportunities for our (small and medium-sized enterprises) and better paying jobs for our people as we ride the AI revolution to fast-track Malaysia's digitally empowered growth journey,\" Trade Minister Zafrul Aziz said in the statement.\n"

Despite record numbers, the market failed to rally along with the company. This includes the Dow Jones index as all 30 of its components ended the day in red on May 23, including some of the best Dow stocks that are direct AI beneficiaries such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nIn its Q1 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) generated a revenue of $26.04 billion, which was up over 262% year-over-year and surprised the consensus estimates by $1.45 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12, an over 460% increase year-over-year. Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10 for 1 split, which will take effect on June 7. For the second quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects a revenue of $28.0 billion. The company predicts that the automotive sector will emerge as the leading enterprise vertical within its Data Center division in the current year. At its Q1 2025 earnings call, the company\u2019s CFO, Colette Kress said:\n\u201cLeading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla\u2019s expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.\u201d\nAfter reporting stellar earnings, NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price crossed the $1000 mark for the first time and was 9.3% higher in a day, at the May 3 market close. Nevertheless, the company failed to rally the market with it as the S&P 500 was down almost 0.75% during the same period, the NASDAQ-composite recorded a decline of 0.4% and the Dow Jones index experienced its worst day in almost 14 months declining by over 1.5%.\nEven though the Dow Jones index is underperforming other indices in 2024, CNBC Mad Money host, Jim Cramer still believes in celebrating its 40,000 points milestone. On May 20, he urged the investors to appreciate the market's progress despite past downturns. Cramer emphasized that while the Dow does not fully represent the market like the S&P 500, it reflects a team effort across various sectors, which should have been demolished by the challenges they faced, such as the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes, inflation, and supply chain issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet they thrived. He acknowledged the potential for market declines but stressed the importance of recognizing the achievements of these stocks and companies over the years.\nCramer mentioned that he started as a summer associate in 1983 at Goldman Sachs when the Dow was just over 1000 points, the market was full of bears in multiple sectors but the stock market \u201cleft them behind.\u201d He added that the index going from 1000 to 40,000 shows the strength of these companies and that they \u201cwill make you money.\u201d\nIn light of these comments, some of the best Dow stocks include Amazon.com, Inc.

The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12, an over 460% increase year-over-year. Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10 for 1 split, which will take effect on June 7. For the second quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects a revenue of $28.0 billion. The company predicts that the automotive sector will emerge as the leading enterprise vertical within its Data Center division in the current year. At its Q1 2025 earnings call, the company\u2019s CFO, Colette Kress said:\n\u201cLeading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla\u2019s expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.\u201d\nAfter reporting stellar earnings, NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price crossed the $1000 mark for the first time and was 9.3% higher in a day, at the May 3 market close.

On May 20, he urged the investors to appreciate the market's progress despite past downturns. Cramer emphasized that while the Dow does not fully represent the market like the S&P 500, it reflects a team effort across various sectors, which should have been demolished by the challenges they faced, such as the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes, inflation, and supply chain issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet they thrived. He acknowledged the potential for market declines but stressed the importance of recognizing the achievements of these stocks and companies over the years.\nCramer mentioned that he started as a summer associate in 1983 at Goldman Sachs when the Dow was just over 1000 points, the market was full of bears in multiple sectors but the stock market \u201cleft them behind.\u201d He added that the index going from 1000 to 40,000 shows the strength of these companies and that they \u201cwill make you money.\u201d\nIn light of these comments, some of the best Dow stocks include Amazon.com, Inc.

        "Text": "While some stocks rise and fall sharply during earnings season, others stand pat. That's pretty much what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) did, as the stock only rose slightly more than the broader market (measured by the S&P 500) the day following earnings.\nHowever, when you dig into the quarter, it may make some wonder why the stock wasn't up more because it was truly incredible. If it should be up more, this could potentially be an opportunity to get in before other investors realize what they've missed.\nMicrosoft has become a behemoth during its long rise to become the largest company in the world. Although it used to claim the title (alongside Apple) of a $3 trillion company, it no longer sits above that threshold. But with these results in mind, it may return there.\nThe law of large numbers states that the larger a figure is, the closer it will be to the average population. When applied to companies and their growth rates, this means that giants like Microsoft shouldn't be growing any faster than the average of all other companies in the market. But Microsoft flies in the face of this assumption.\nIn the third quarter (ended March 31), Microsoft's revenue rose 17%, and earnings per share (EPS) increased by 20% year over year. That's much faster than most companies, making these results all the more impressive. Furthermore, all of its business segments exceeded the expectations given in Q2.\nBusiness Segment\nQ3 YOY Growth Projection\nQ3 YOY Actual Growth\nProductivity and Business Processes\n9% to 10%\n12%\nIntelligent Cloud\n19% to 20%\n21%\nMore Personal Computing\n10% to 13%\n17%\nData source: The Motley Fool and Microsoft. YOY = year over year.\nBut there is one business segment that's doing the heavy lifting. Of Microsoft's three business groups, Intelligent Cloud was the outlier, with its revenue rising 21% year over year to $26.7 billion (35% of its total revenue). This was powered by Microsoft Azure's incredible growth of 31% -- the best of the three major cloud-computing competitors. Why is cloud computing doing so well? It's likely related to artificial intelligence (AI).\nAI requires massive data storage and computing power to create the best models. Most companies can't justify purchasing their own server to store and process this data, so they rent computing power from Microsoft. This is convenient for the customer, as they can scale their usage up or down as needed or rent more computing power when they have a large model to run.\nAs everyone rushes to implement AI into their business, Microsoft is seeing a huge demand surge that's boosting Azure and other cloud services Microsoft provides. Given how well Microsoft is doing, you'd think its stock would be up, but that's not the case.\nThere's a great reason why Microsoft stock is still fairly flat after earnings. Leading into the quarter, Microsoft needed to post a perfect quarter to avoid a drop from its lofty levels.\nMicrosoft's stock was trading at nearly 39 times earnings less than a month ago but still trades for an expensive 35 times earnings after results. That's a premium price reserved only for a few companies growing quickly or executing at a high level. For reference, AI powerhouse Nvidia currently trades at 34 times forward earnings.\nSo, for Microsoft to avoid a valuation drop, it needed to post a perfect quarter, which it essentially did. Microsoft still has a premium valuation, so its Q4 execution must be similarly flawless.\nAs a result, I don't think now is a great time to buy Microsoft stock, as there isn't much room for upside. Instead, investors should shift their focus to other companies that are delivering similar execution levels but trade for much lower premiums.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in an emailed statement, without specifying the number of employees it sent the request to.\nMicrosoft remains committed to China and will continue to operate there and other markets, the spokesperson said.\nThe Windows maker is among U.S. companies that have the largest presence in China. It entered the market in 1992 and operates a large research and development center in the country.\nThe employees, mostly engineers of Chinese nationality, were earlier in the week offered an option to transfer to the U.S., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nReuters could not immediately verify those details.\nThe move comes days after U.S. President Joe Biden's administration hiked tariffs on various Chinese imports including electric vehicle batteries, computer chips and medical products.\nReuters reported earlier this month that the U.S. Commerce Department is considering a new regulatory push to restrict the export of proprietary or closed-source AI models, whose software and the data it is trained on are kept under wraps.\n(Reporting by Kanjyik Ghosh, Surbhi Misra and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Fanny Potkin; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee)\n"

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When looking at companies outside of Nvidia that are seeing immediate benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), one company that stands out is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). And with its fiscal third-quarter results in the books, the software giant once again showed that it's delivering on its AI vision.\nLet's look at how the company's results are being driven by AI and whether that makes the stock a buy at current levels.\nThrough its large investment in OpenAI and its ChatGP chatbot, Microsoft has been at the forefront of pushing AI into the mainstream. The company has embraced the technology and has quickly employed it throughout its various offerings. So far, this bet is paying off, evidenced by its strong earnings results.\nAzure, Microsoft's cloud-computing business, was once again the biggest beneficiary of its AI initiatives. For its fiscal third quarter ended in March, Azure revenue climbed 31%. The company sees no slowdown in the business, forecasting fiscal Q4 Azure revenue growth of between 30% to 31% in constant currencies.\nAzure's strong growth is being led by its AI consumption business. Azure customers are only charged based on the resources they use, and usage has been skyrocketing from customers building their own AI solutions using the Azure platform. AI services added seven percentage points to Azure's growth. This means the core Azure business grew a robust 24%.\nMicrosoft said that more than 65% of Fortune 500 companies now use Azure OpenAI services, while deals are also getting larger. It said Azure deals worth $100 million or more rose 80% year over year, while deals worth $10 million or more doubled. The company plans to invest heavily in infrastructure and AI in fiscal 2024 to meet increasing demand.\nCloud computing isn't the only area where AI is helping drive growth for Microsoft as its AI assistants called Copilots are also gaining a lot of traction. Developer platform GitHub saw revenue soar 45% as more companies embraced its GitHub Copilot, which can complete coding or make suggestions as developers type. Microsoft said more than 90% of the Fortune 100 are now GitHub customers.\nMicrosoft 365, its suite of production tools that include Word and Excel, meanwhile, saw revenue grow 14%. The company said its Copilot for Microsoft 365 was seeing increased adoption across various industries. The company is even using AI to help propel growth at its employment-focused social media platform LinkedIn. It said new AI features helped lead to a 29% increase in LinkedIn Premium growth, while overall growth was 10%.\nMicrosoft's results clearly show that the company is at the forefront of the AI revolution. While Azure is leading the way, Microsoft is benefiting from AI across most of its business lines. The company has taken the lead in AI and has created an early-mover advantage.\nIt will also be interesting to see what future applications Microsoft may apply AI to moving forward. On its earnings call, the company talked about making devices specifically for AI. But for me, what Microsoft does with AI in its gaming unit could be a game changer down the line. The next iteration of Xbox, while likely years away, could be a powerful growth driver as the company incorporates AI into games.\nGiven Microsoft's current success and the opportunity in front of it, investors have bid up the stock strongly since the end of 2022. That has given the company a current valuation of around 35 times expected earnings and 12.5 times sales. For a company growing its overall revenue in the mid-teens, that's not a cheap valuation. Note that Microsoft's overall revenue grew 17% in its fiscal third quarter and is up 16% through the first nine months of the year.\nMSFT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\nMicrosoft has a bright future in front of it, but the stock looks pretty fully valued at the moment. The market can be volatile in the short run, so while I think the stock should work in the long term, I do think there could be better buying opportunities for the stock in the future. So, as a new money buyer, I'd be on the lookout for a price dip before jumping into the stock.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is going all in on AI for the PC.\nThe company on Monday announced a new category of PCs called Copilot+ PCs, a new variety of computers equipped with so-called AI PC chips and running Microsoft's latest version of Windows 11 and its Copilot AI software.\nMicrosoft also revealed that its Copilot+ PCs will now run on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, allowing the assistant to interact with your PC via text, video, and voice. Users will also be able to share their screen with Copilot and have a natural conversation with the app.\n\"The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert. This in turn will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Monday. \"For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows.\"\nMicrosoft's new PC push comes as the PC market enters the early innings of a turnaround after two years of declines. According to IDC, PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 28.7% decline during the same time in 2023.\nYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs to be purchased over the next year.\nCopilot+ PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet.\nCopilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance.\nIn a pre-recorded demonstration of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, a user fired up the game Minecraft and asked Copilot how to craft a sword. The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item.\nMicrosoft says it will integrate Copilot for a number of gaming apps, and because it will run on your PC's NPU rather than its GPU, it shouldn't hurt overall performance.\nMicrosoft also touted the performance of its Copilot+ PCs and hammered home what it sees as a performance advantage over similar Apple (AAPL) devices.\nAccording to the company, a laptop running one of Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite chips will provide 20% more battery life than Apple's MacBook Air, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance. The company also demonstrated Adobe's Photoshop running on its Surface laptop and beating Apple's MacBook Air with M3 chips in certain tasks.\nIn addition to rolling out Copilot+ PC versions of its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro devices, Microsoft said this software will be featured in Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung products.\nMicrosoft's announcements come just a few weeks before rival Apple (AAPL) is expected to debut its own AI features across its product lines, including the iPhone and Mac, at its WWDC developer event on June 10.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Diane Brady, Nicholas Gordon ",
        "Text": "Good morning.\nIn his decade as CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella has transformed a troubled tech giant into the world\u2019s most valuable company, with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion. In his 32 years at Microsoft, though, Nadella has lived through four major technology platform shifts\u2014from PCs to the web, mobile, cloud computing and now AI\u2014and he knows how the company struggled to compete after some of them. That may explain the air of urgency and mild paranoia that Nadella projects in Fortune\u2019s latest cover story on Nadella by my colleague Jeremy Kahn.\nAs Nadella told Jeremy: \u201cWhen the paradigm shifts, do you have something to contribute? Because there is no God-given right to exist if you don\u2019t have anything relevant.\u201d\nWith Microsoft\u2019s partnership and $13 billion-plus investment in OpenAI, Nadella has given the tech giant a clear lead in the AI era. (The Microsoft Build developer conference kicks off tomorrow and is likely to feature several significant AI-fueled upgrades.) As Jeremy points out in his article, the company\u2019s ties to OpenAI also come with risk, as we saw when OpenAI\u2019s board fired\u2014and then begrudgingly rehired\u2014CEO Sam Altman last year. The recent departure of OpenAI researchers Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike also sparked concern since it led to the dissolution of a team focused on the safety of hypothetical future AI systems that would be more capable than any human. And plenty of rivals are rushing in to compete.\nNo one is more aware of the risks than Nadella. He lived through the Microsoft antitrust case in the late 1990s that forced the company to open up its Windows operating system to competition after it was found guilty of trying to monopolize the browser market. That experience may have factored into the company's recent decision to\u00a0unbundle\u00a0its Teams videoconference app from its Office software (though the still-looming threat of EU antitrust action was likely a bigger impetus). He saw Microsoft make failed bets on media players, cell phones, tablets and other technologies. He notices when customers give a piece of their business, however small, to a rival. \nBut Nadella is perhaps most sensitive to public scrutiny, telling Jeremy that what keeps him up at night is the possibility that his company might lose \u201cits license to operate\u201d\u2014the one that relies on maintaining public trust by being a force for good in the communities in which it operates. Maintaining that license means investing in local economies, as he recently demonstrated with several announcements in Asia. It means figuring out how to meet Microsoft's 2030 goals to become carbon negative when its AI push has sent CO2 emissions up 30% since 2020. And throughout his tenure, it has meant trying to create and sustain a culture that\u2019s humble, hungry and ready to grow.

The Alphabet Inc. division is offering 18 months free to corporate customers that sign a three-year contract, a hefty discount after that and incident response services from Google\u2019s Mandiant security business. All customers will receive free consulting services to help them make the switch.\nGoogle also released a white paper Monday highlighting its rival\u2019s security lapses, and is considering launching similarly-themed social-media and advertising campaigns.\n\u201cThe repeated security challenges with Microsoft call for a better alternative for enterprises and public-sector organizations alike,\u201d Google wrote in the white paper. \u201cWe believe Google Workspace presents a safer alternative, with a proven track record of engineering excellence, deep investment in cutting edge defenses, and a transparent culture where providing security for customers is treated as a profound responsibility.\u201d\nLast month, the US Cyber Safety Review Board issued a scathing report documenting Microsoft\u2019s inability to stop China-linked hackers from breaking into the email accounts of US officials last year. The report called on Microsoft to institute urgent reforms, which the company has pledged to do as part of its biggest security overhaul in more than two decades.\nRead More: Microsoft, Beset by Hacks, Grapples With Problem Years in the Making\nGoogle has struggled to persuade customers to ditch Office but says Microsoft\u2019s cybersecurity travails have made customers more open to switching. At a recent Google conference, according to Wen, corporate customers said their boards and executives had given them a deadline to stop using Microsoft because they could \u201cno longer sustain the risk.\u201d\nWen also noted that Google conducted its own security overhaul after a 2009 hack that saw Chinese-linked attackers breach the company\u2019s servers and gain access to a database containing details of US surveillance targets.\nThe timing could be advantageous. People are increasingly familiar with Google\u2019s applications after using them at home and school, while some corporations are unhappy with Office price increases and additional fees to use new artificial intelligence features.\nThere also is some appetite to reduce government agencies\u2019 reliance on one vendor \u2014 especially one with security issues \u2014 according to Jeanette Manfra, a former Department of Homeland Security official who now runs Google\u2019s global risk and compliance operation.\nStill, Google will have to overcome cultural resistance, she said, in part because many federal chief information officers are in their roles for only a few years and typically shy away from major new projects.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to just stick with your same path,\u201d she said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019\nGoogle\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth\nThe Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\nHow the $17 Desk Salad Won\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Microsoft's Xbox is shutting down a number of gaming studios including Arkane Austin, making it the latest publisher to shut down studios amid signs of a gaming slowdown.\nStudios such as \"Hi-Fi Rush\" maker Tango Gameworks, headquartered in Tokyo, and Canada-based Alpha Dog will also be closed and some employees will be laid off, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios said in a memo that was seen by Reuters on Tuesday.\nXbox declined to comment when asked about the number of employees impacted by the layoffs.\nGrowth in personal computing and console gaming is expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels as gamers record fewer hours of playtime owing to weaker release schedules, data from research firm Newzoo showed.\nThe \"reprioritization of titles and resources\" is so that Xbox can invest deeply into its portfolio of games and new intellectual property, according to Booty.\nAll the affected studios are units of ZeniMax Media, which was acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in 2021, and Bethesda.\nMicrosoft's Xbox content and services segment reported a 62% jump in third-quarter revenue last month, largely driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" maker Take-Two Interactive said it would shut down two subsidiary studios as part of a mass layoff, Bloomberg News reported last week.\nMicrosoft previously laid off 1,900 employees at Activision and Xbox at the start of the year.\nSome developers from Arkane Austin will join other studios and work on projects across Bethesda, the creator of \"The Elder Scrolls\" and \"Fallout\" titles.\nServers of the game \"Redfall\", made by Arkane, will continue to remain online for players.\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. and Brookfield Asset Management\u2019s green energy arm signed the biggest corporate clean-energy purchase agreement ever announced, as the technology giant ramps up its investment in artificial intelligence.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIsrael Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short\nJack Dorsey Leaves Bluesky Board, Calls X \u2018Freedom Technology\u2019\nAt $2 Million Per Minute, Treasuries Mint Cash Like Never Before\nEx-Trump Controller Says Cohen Repaid From Personal Account\nS&P 500 Extends Gains in Final Minutes of Trading: Markets Wrap\nBrookfield Renewable Partners will provide more than 10.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the US and Europe starting in 2026, according to a statement Wednesday. That\u2019s comparable to about 10 nuclear power plants and reflects the turbocharged demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence.\nTechnology companies are clamoring for more clean energy to meet their own climate goals, just as overall energy demand is rising.\n\u201cIt is absolutely the largest single announcement for a corporate clean-power purchase agreement ever,\u201d BloombergNEF analyst Kyle Harrison said in a message. \u201cIt cements Microsoft as the second-largest corporate buyer of clean energy\u201d through power purchase agreements, after Amazon.\nIt\u2019s difficult to estimate the cost for 10.5 gigawatts of new capacity because development costs vary significantly by energy type and location. But if all the development was US solar farms, they would cost more than $11.5 billion to build, according to BloombergNEF. Building that much US wind power would cost almost $17 billion.\nShares of Brookfield Renewable Partners rose as much as 8.5% in New York, the biggest intraday increase since mid-November. Microsoft rose as much as 1.6%.\nAfter minimal growth over the past two decades, US power consumption is forecast to expand quickly in response to demand from the new data centers needed to develop and run AI, as well as new factories and electric vehicles. Last month, power generator Exelon Corp. predicted a 900% jump in power demand from data centers planned in the Chicago area.\nSuch a dramatic forecast presents a challenge for technology companies to secure additional power supplies while simultaneously reducing emissions. Microsoft has a goal of matching all its electricity consumption with zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030.\nRead More: AI\u2019s Growing Energy Use Has Data Centers Chasing Clean Power\nMicrosoft is pouring billions into developing its AI capabilities, and the data centers needed to support them, because it sees the technology as a key tool to attract customers for its cloud computing services.\nAI tools are incredibly resource-intensive to run and many companies don\u2019t have the data center capacity to support their own large-scale AI operations. Instead, they\u2019re turning to big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon.com Inc. for help running AI programs on the cloud.\nJust last week, Microsoft reported a 17% jump in revenue in the third quarter, totaling $61.9 billion, thanks to a surge in corporate demand for its cloud and AI offerings. On Tuesday, Amazon\u2019s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year.\nMicrosoft and Brookfield said the deal is almost eight times larger than any other single corporate power-purchase agreement, and it may later be expanded to include new renewables capacity in Asia and Latin America.\nThe accord will focus on wind and solar, but also include \u201cnew or impactful carbon free energy generation technologies,\u201d the companies said.\n(Updates with share move in sixth paragraph.

        "Text": "When it comes to explaining the power of stock market investing, one example that frequently makes the rounds is how rich you would be now if you had invested in Microsoft when the software company went public in 1986. As Benzinga reported last fall, $1,000 worth of Microsoft stock at its IPO has since ballooned in value to more than $4.5 million. Today, you could earn about $1,000 a month just on Microsoft dividends alone \u2014 if you have enough shares.\nCheck Out: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\nRead Next: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\nA recent analysis from Benzinga, published on March 8, looked at the potential dividend payout if you are invested in Microsoft stock. The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant currently pays a dividend of $0.75 per share, which equals an annual dividend of $3 per share.\nAt the time of the Benzinga analysis, Microsoft\u2019s stock price was $409.14 a share. It has since fallen back and currently trades near $396 \u2014 up roughly 5% since the beginning of the year. At the former price of $409.14, the stock\u2019s dividend yield equaled 0.72%, according to Benzinga.\nSo how could you earn $1,000 just for being a Microsoft investor?\nBenzinga assumed that your earnings target is $1,000 per month, or $12,000 a year, from Microsoft\u2019s dividends. In this case, your estimated investment value would be about $1,643,836, which is roughly 4,018 shares at $409.14 each.\nAs Benzinga explained, to calculate your estimated investment value you need two variables: your desired annual earnings target ($12,000) and the dividend yield of the stock (0.73%). Here\u2019s the formula: $12,000 / 0.0073 = $1,643,835.62 to generate an income of $1,000 per month.\nKeep in mind that the Benzinga calculation was done nearly two months ago, when Microsoft\u2019s stock sold for $409.14 a share. The numbers have since changed, along with Microsoft\u2019s share price.\nLearn More: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nBut this much remains true: To earn $1,000 a month on Microsoft dividends, you already need to have a nice pile of money \u2014 in this case, more than $1.6 million worth of Microsoft stock.

        "Text": "New data reveals APAC employees are engaging with AI to enhance skills amidst limited organizational support\u2014\u00a0leaders must now harness this for tangible business impact.\nSINGAPORE, May 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. and LinkedIn released the 2024 Work Trend Index, a joint report on the state of AI at work titled, \"AI at work is here. Now comes the hard part.\"\nAlongside this research, Microsoft announced new capabilities in Copilot in Microsoft 365, and LinkedIn unlocked more than 50 learning courses for LinkedIn Premium subscribers designed to empower professionals at all levels to advance their AI aptitude.\nThe research\u2014based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries*, labor and hiring trends on LinkedIn, trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals and research with Fortune 500 customers\u2014shows how, just one year in, AI is influencing the way people work, lead and hire around the world.\n2024 is the year of AI at work. The use of generative AI at work has nearly doubled in the last six months. LinkedIn is seeing a significant increase in professionals adding AI skills to their profiles, and most leaders say they wouldn't hire someone without AI skills. However, with many leaders in Asia worried that their company lacks an AI vision and with employees bringing their own AI tools to work, leaders have reached the hard part of any tech disruption: moving from experimentation to tangible business impact.\n\"The pace of diffusion of generative AI tools at the workplace is remarkable. Employees are empowering themselves by adopting agile and innovative tools, oftentimes not pausing for the rollout of a coherent AI vision and roadmap from their organizations. Leaders must demonstrate more appetite for rapid experimentation to realize the benefits of both productivity and increased metabolism in the industries they operate in,\" said Ahmed Mazhari, President of Microsoft Asia.\nThe Work Trend Index report reveals three urgent insights that every APAC leader and professional needs to know about AI's impact on work and the labor market in the year ahead:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employees want AI at work\u2014and won't wait for companies to catch up:\n83% of knowledge workers in APAC now use AI at work. Employees, many of them struggling to keep up with the pace and volume of work, say AI saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work.\nWhile 84% of the APAC leaders believe their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive, 61% worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement it. So, employees are taking things into their own hands. 79% of APAC AI users are bringing their own tools to work\u2014Bring Your Own AI (BYOAI)\u2014missing out on the benefits that come from strategic AI use at scale and putting company data at risk. The opportunity for every leader is to channel this momentum into ROI.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For employees, AI raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling:\nA majority of global leaders (55%) are concerned about having enough talent to fill roles this year, with leaders in cybersecurity, engineering, and creative design feeling the pinch most.\n76% of APAC leaders say they'd rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate who lacked them.\nAs of late last year, we've seen a 142x increase in members globally adding AI skills like ChatGPT and Copilot to their LinkedIn profiles.\nAI mentions in LinkedIn job posts drive a 17% bump in application growth.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rise of the AI power user\u2014and what they reveal about the future:\nAI power-users have reoriented their workdays, saving 30 minutes per day. 88% of APAC power users bookend their day with AI, using AI to get started in the morning and get ready for the following workday.\n\"Asia Pacific is witnessing a transformative shift at the workplace due to AI, prompting the need for fresh business approaches,\" stated Feon Ang, Managing Director, Asia Pacific, LinkedIn. \"With how rapidly our ecosystem is evolving, leaders who prioritize agility and invest in skill development gain a competitive edge by fostering an equipped workforce that is ready for AI. 76% of APAC leaders would hire someone who is less experienced with AI skills, which emphasizes the urgency and importance for professionals to focus on advancing their AI aptitude through upskilling.\"\nMicrosoft is also announcing Copilot for Microsoft 365 innovations to help people get started with AI.\nCopilot will become more conversational by suggesting follow-up prompts or asking clarifying questions to provide the best response possible.\nA new chat interface in Copilot will proactively offer timely recommendations based on recent activity, like \"You missed Tuesday's sales meeting. Here's a quick summary\" or flagging an important email for follow up.\nThe prompt box in Copilot will now have an auto complete experience, allowing users to get better results from their prompts. If you've already written the prompt, a new rewrite feature will turn basic prompts into rich ones, grounded in your work meetings, documents and emails.\nUpdates to Copilot Lab will allow employees to create, publish, and manage prompts that are expressly tailored to their team.\nLinkedIn is now providing AI tools to enable you to stay ahead in your career, with over 600 AI courses currently and 50 new AI learning courses available for everyone for free through July 8.\nIn addition, AI-powered coaching offers personalized content and conversational learning.\nFor LinkedIn Premium subscribers, new AI-powered personalized takeaways on LinkedIn Feed offer you insights, ideas and actions to take.\nAI-powered tools make it easier to assess your fit for a role in seconds based on your experience and skills.

Having contracted almost one gigawatt of renewable capacity to date outside of the agreement, this agreement builds on the strong collaboration and extends it into the future.\nThe agreement provides a pathway for Brookfield to deliver over 10.5 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity between 2026 and 2030 in the U.S. and Europe. The agreement includes the potential to increase its scope to deliver additional renewable energy capacity within the U.S. and Europe, and beyond to Asia-Pacific, India, and Latin America, and provides an incentive for Brookfield to build a large portfolio of new renewable energy projects over the coming years.\nThe agreement provides Microsoft with access to a pipeline of new renewable energy capacity to support the growing demand for cloud services at home and at work. The scale of the new capacity from Brookfield will contribute to the decarbonization of the grid and accelerate the global shift to renewable energy solutions within the cloud industry. The agreement will not only focus on wind and solar, but also new or impactful carbon free energy generation technologies.\n\u201cAs the global trend of digitalization and the adoption of AI continues to drive growth in demand for electricity, we are thrilled to collaborate with Microsoft to support their customer demand with the build-out of over 10.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity. This first of its kind agreement, which is almost eight times larger than the largest single corporate PPA ever signed, is a testament to our ability to reliably deliver clean power solutions at scale to our corporate partners and accelerate the energy transition,\" said Connor Teskey, CEO of Brookfield Renewable and President of Brookfield Asset Management.\n\u201cMicrosoft wants to use our influence and purchasing power to create lasting positive impact for all electricity consumers.

That\u2019s comparable to about 10 nuclear power plants and reflects the turbocharged demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence.\nTechnology companies are clamoring for more clean energy to meet their own climate goals, just as overall energy demand is rising.\n\u201cIt is absolutely the largest single announcement for a corporate clean-power purchase agreement ever,\u201d BloombergNEF analyst Kyle Harrison said in a message. \u201cIt cements Microsoft as the second-largest corporate buyer of clean energy\u201d through power purchase agreements, after Amazon.\nIt\u2019s difficult to estimate the cost for 10.5 gigawatts of new capacity because development costs vary significantly by energy type and location. But if all the development was US solar farms, they would cost more than $11.5 billion to build, according to BloombergNEF. Building that much US wind power would cost almost $17 billion.\nShares of Brookfield Renewable Partners rose as much as 8.5% in New York, the biggest intraday increase since mid-November. Microsoft rose as much as 1.6%.\nAfter minimal growth over the past two decades, US power consumption is forecast to expand quickly in response to demand from the new data centers needed to develop and run AI, as well as new factories and electric vehicles. Last month, power generator Exelon Corp. predicted a 900% jump in power demand from data centers planned in the Chicago area.\nSuch a dramatic forecast presents a challenge for technology companies to secure additional power supplies while simultaneously reducing emissions. Microsoft has a goal of matching all its electricity consumption with zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030.\nRead More: AI\u2019s Growing Energy Use Has Data Centers Chasing Clean Power\nMicrosoft is pouring billions into developing its AI capabilities, and the data centers needed to support them, because it sees the technology as a key tool to attract customers for its cloud computing services.\nAI tools are incredibly resource-intensive to run and many companies don\u2019t have the data center capacity to support their own large-scale AI operations. Instead, they\u2019re turning to big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon.com Inc. for help running AI programs on the cloud.\nJust last week, Microsoft reported a 17% jump in revenue in the third quarter, totaling $61.9 billion, thanks to a surge in corporate demand for its cloud and AI offerings. On Tuesday, Amazon\u2019s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year.\nMicrosoft and Brookfield said the deal is almost eight times larger than any other single corporate power-purchase agreement, and it may later be expanded to include new renewables capacity in Asia and Latin America.\nThe accord will focus on wind and solar, but also include \u201cnew or impactful carbon free energy generation technologies,\u201d the companies said.\n(Updates with share move in sixth paragraph.

This means that keeping workers happy might just climb back to the top of managers' to-do lists.\nLinkedIn and Microsoft told Fortune that three reasons behind the sudden uptick in workers eyeing up the exit were burnout, a lack of learning opportunities, and artificial intelligence.\nLinkedIn\u2019s Workforce Confidence Index found that 59% of U.S. employees who are actively job-seeking agree that they feel stuck in their job (vs. 35% of those who are not job-seeking) and 51% feel burnt out from their job (vs 37%).\nLikewise, Microsoft\u2019s Work Trend Index echoed that 68% of people globally struggle with the pace and volume of work and 46% feel burned out.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s easy to mistake low attrition for contentment, in reality, many employees feel stuck and wish they could do something new, but haven\u2019t (yet) made the leap,\u201d LinkedIn COO Daniel Shapero recently wrote in a blog post on preparing for The Great Reshuffle 2.0.\nIt perhaps explains why LinkedIn found that learning opportunities are seen as a top retention strategy.\nThe networking platform\u2019s 2024 Workplace Learning Report showed that globally, companies with strong learning cultures enjoy higher retention rates, with more internal mobility and people moving into management roles.\nPlus, with AI threatening to displace workers, workers are placing more importance on learning than ever before\u2014and if they aren\u2019t getting help on fine-tuning their AI skills with their current employer, they may start looking elsewhere.\nLinkedIn research shows that people want to learn how to use AI in their work, with two-thirds insisting it\u2019ll help with their career progression.\nAs Shapero points out, history often repeats itself, and periods of low attraction are usually followed by high attrition.\nA simple reason for this pattern could be that the grass isn\u2019t always greener on the other side.\nThose who switched jobs in 2022 are now reporting being less satisfied at work than those who stayed put, according to a survey from the Conference Board.\nMeanwhile, the HR platform, Paychex surveyed employees who quit during The Great Resignation and similarly found that 80% regret it. \nIn the end, money can\u2019t fix everything. Both studies highlighted that those who were lured by big pay bumps during the pandemic may have failed to consider other key aspects of working.\nEssentially, you can\u2019t put a price on work-life balance, job satisfaction and good company.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Andrea Shalal ",
        "Text": "By Andrea Shalal\nRACINE, Wisconsin (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled plans by Microsoft Corp to build a $3.3 billion data center in southeastern Wisconsin, drawing a sharp contrast to his Republican predecessor who had backed a previous $10 billion project at the same site that was significantly scaled back.\nBiden, on his fourth visit to Wisconsin this year, said Microsoft's investment would create thousands of jobs in the presidential election battleground state that his campaign sees as critical to his bid for a second term.\nThe facility will be built where Biden's rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, announced a $10 billion investment by Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn in 2017 that the company later drastically scaled back. Trump had called it \"the eighth wonder of the world.\"\n\"I'm here to talk about a great comeback story in America,\" Biden told about 200 people at Gateway Technical College's Sturtevant campus in a Midwestern state hit by manufacturing declines.\nThe president said Microsoft's investment would \"be transformative, not only here, but worldwide.\"\n\"My predecessor made promises, which he broke,\" Biden said. \"On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises.\"\nFoxconn in 2021 said it would invest $672 million at the site instead of the $10 billion initially planned and forecast 1,454 new jobs, down from 13,000 as its plans shifted and tax breaks were reduced amid local skepticism.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith said the U.S. company planned to invest $3.3 billion by the end of 2026 and use artificial intelligence to boost manufacturing and help workers.\nThe White House said that investment would result in 2,300 union construction jobs and around 2,000 permanent jobs over time. It said nearly 4,000 jobs had been added in the nearby city of Racine since Biden took office, while about 1,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during the Trump administration.\n\"We will train over 100,000 people in Wisconsin by the end of the decade so they have the AI skills to fill the jobs of tomorrow,\" Smith said. He credited Biden's legislation on infrastructure, chips and climate change with laying the groundwork for the investment.\nMicrosoft will partner with Gateway Technical College to train 1,000 people for data center and other roles by 2030 and will work to train 1,000 business leaders to adopt AI in their operations, the White House added.\nBLACK VOTER SUPPORT\nAfter the Microsoft event, Biden shook hands and bantered with about 50 campaign volunteers from Racine's Black community, urging them to take Trump at his word when he threatened to reverse gains made during Biden's presidency.\nBiden is seeking to shore up support among Black voters ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election, with national polls showing him essentially tied in a rematch with Trump, a Republican making his third bid for the White House after losing to Biden in 2020.\nBiden's campaign has launched a $14 million ad campaign, including ads targeting Black, Latino and Asian voters. On Thursday, it plans a blitz on what it says are Trump's attacks on healthcare.\nIn Wisconsin, Biden ribbed his predecessor for the failed investment in Racine County. \"Foxconn turned out to be just that - a con,\" he said.\nRepresentatives for Trump's campaign could not be immediately reached for comment.\nFoxconn said in a statement that employment at its Wisconsin operations had grown 42% since 2020 and that it had become the surrounding county's largest taxpayer in recent years. \"We are proud of the over 1,000 men and women who work at Foxconn Wisconsin,\" it said.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; additional reporting by Nandita Bose, Susan Heavey and Katharine Jackson; Editing by Heather Timmons, Cynthia Osterman and Rosalba O'Brien)\n"

Most AI models including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT rely on cloud services to learn and infer patterns from data, but Microsoft wanted to deliver a truly secure system to the US intelligence community.\nSpy agencies around the world want generative AI to help them understand and analyze the growing amounts of classified information generated daily, but must balance turning to large language models with the risk that data could leak into the open \u2014 or get deliberately hacked.\nMicrosoft has deployed the GPT4-based model and key elements that support it onto a cloud with an \u201cair-gapped\u201d environment that is isolated from the internet, said William Chappell, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer for strategic missions and technology.\nIntelligence officials have repeatedly made clear they hanker after the same generative AI tools that promise to revolutionize swaths of business and modernize economies.

For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$206b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.4%) = US$4.5t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.5t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$2.3t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.2t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$425, the company appears about fair value at a 2.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.012. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

        "Title": "Reports indicate that Microsoft may lift the freeze on specific employee salaries while emphasizing 'more' accountability for top executives",
        "Author": "  Kevin Okemwa ",
        "Text": "Microsoft could potentially end its salary freeze for some employees.\nThe Redmond giant stopped raising salaries for full-time staff last year due to tough economic times.\nThe salary freeze sparked mixed feelings among most employees, who started questioning the company's leadership.\nThe decision negatively impacted some of the employees' performance and morale.\nLast year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella informed the company's full-time staffers they wouldn't get a salary raise. The CEO blamed tough economic times, further indicating that it was a difficult decision under consideration for several months.\nBut as it now seems, the company is over the hump. According to a spot by Business Insider, Microsoft executive vice president of cloud and AI Scott Guthrie indicated that merit raises are set to increase this year while at an employee meeting. For context, Microsoft refers to performance-based raises as merit increases.\nIn 2023, top Microsoft executives, including Satya Nadella and Brad Smith, received major pay cuts after missing financial targets. For instance, Satya Nadella's 2023 compensation was $48,512,537, down from 2022's $54,946,310, while other C-suite members, like Amy Hood and Brad Smith, were hit even harder, losing 22-24%.\nMicrosoft seems to be on an upward trajectory. Recently, it ranked as the world's most valuable company, with over $3 trillion in market capitalization. This has placed it in front of Apple, with market analysts predicting that the tech giant is on the brink of reaching its iPhone moment with AI.\nPer Business Insider's report, Microsoft began its annual review with a performance review last month. Microsoft employees will reportedly receive notifications about how their performance index affects compensation rates in August. Payouts will be made late in September.\nShortly after the memo leaked indicating that Microsoft's full-time staff weren't getting a salary raise, some employees started expressing concern about the company's leadership. The company's decision to cut 10,000 jobs by the end of FY23 Q3 was also a contributing factor.\nIn a leaked poll, less than half of Microsoft employees are willing to retain their positions at the company if they get another offer elsewhere. The employees further disclosed the lack of a raise negatively impacted their performance index and morale at work. Microsoft posted an\u00a0impressive earnings report for FY24 Q3 with a 17% increase in revenue; as such, there's a likelihood that employees will benefit, too.\nAs it happens, Microsoft is shifting its focus to cybersecurity and has put elaborate measures in place to help remedy its \"cascade of security failures.\" Perhaps the most intriguing one is that it'll now hold top company officials accountable for cybersecurity by tying a portion of their compensation packages to meeting security goals and metrics.\n"

        "Author": "  Emma Burleigh ",
        "Text": "Good morning!\nThe AI revolution is upon us, and CHROs across the world are scrambling to figure out how to integrate the new technology into their companies. It can be used to optimize everything from screening r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to interviewing candidates, and it's on its way to becoming the new super tool for managers everywhere\u2014if they learn how to implement it in a meaningful way.\nMicrosoft is one of the biggest players in the AI space, thanks to big bets early on and pouring billions into OpenAI, among other investments. But the company has also been tasked with rolling out the technology within its own workforce of more than 200,000 employees. And a recent LinkedIn post from Christopher J. Fernandez, Microsoft\u2019s VP of human resources, provides an insight into what they\u2019ve been up to so far.\nFernandez writes that Microsoft\u2019s \u201chuman-centered approach,\u201d based on the company\u2019s responsible AI tenants, has been key; those include accountability, inclusiveness, reliability and safety, fairness, transparency, and privacy and security. \u201cThe principles have guided every decision our HR team has made related to the implementation of first- and third-party AI solutions,\u201d he writes.\nHe also highlights that HR workers don\u2019t need computer engineering degrees to be key players in the AI metamorphosis of corporate America. \u201cThe adoption and transformation journey I and my team have been on proves you need not be a technologist to drive material digital transformation and AI adoption in your organization,\u201d he writes.\nTo that end, Microsoft trained and empowered HR employees to become \u201ccitizen developers\u201d for their own AI needs via a platform that did not require advanced coding skills. That allowed Microsoft HR workers to build their own AI applications and custom tools to transform operations and automate tedious processes. One such creation was the HR Virtual Agent, an AI-powered HR bot that answered routine employee questions about benefits and workplace issues, and led to a productivity gain of around 160,000 hours for HR service advisors.\nIn another instance, HR workers built upon an existing generative AI product to create the Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service AI application, a case management tool which was rolled out to the company\u2019s global HR service centers this year. It has led to a 26% faster response rate to initial HR inquiries, and a 7% reduction in case resolution time.\nFernandez writes that the company\u2019s workers overall have had higher job satisfaction and an optimized employee experience because of HR\u2019s foray into AI. HR workers using Copilot Dynamics 365 Customer Service were 16% more likely to say they enjoyed their job. And looking forward, Microsoft will continue to leverage AI in the HR function.\n\u201cJobs will change and evolve with AI, as has been the case with all technological advancements in history,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe cannot predict what the future holds, but we can be the ones to shape our future with AI.\u201d\nEmma Burleighemma.burleigh@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "A 2019 email from Microsoft\u2019s CTO to CEO Satya Nadella and Bill Gates shows how spooked the company was by AI rivals Google and OpenAI",
        "Author": "  Paolo Confino ",
        "Text": "In 2019, Microsoft executives at the highest level had an anxious email exchange about AI that would ultimately kick-start its AI investment.\nBack then, chief technology officer Kevin Scott sent a four-page email to CEO Satya Nadella and cofounder Bill Gates with the subject line \u201cthoughts on OpenAI,\u201d which outlined his fears that Microsoft was falling drastically behind in the AI race. At the time, ChatGPT was still more than four years away from being released to the public. But even then, Scott realized OpenAI and Google had made extraordinary steps forward in their work on AI.\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s interesting about what OpenAI and DeepMind and Google Brain are doing is the scale of their ambition,\u201d Scott wrote.\nThe email, which is heavily redacted, came to light as part of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust investigation into Google and was first reported by Business Insider.\nThat same year, Microsoft would invest $1 billion in OpenAI, the very company Scott cited in his email. Eventually the tech giant would go on to invest at least another $10 billion into the startup, which is credited for popularizing AI chatbots for everyday use with the launch of ChatGPT. The two companies are now intertwined. Microsoft brings its vast resources, the need for which Scott outlines in his email, while OpenAI brings its cutting-edge AI expertise that had so preoccupied the Microsoft executive.\nIn his email, Scott says he miscalculated what exactly Google and OpenAI were trying to accomplish with their AI work. At the time, DeepMind, a startup owned by Google, was trying to build an AI system that could play the Chinese board game Go, which Scott seems to be referencing.\n\u201cI was highly dismissive of that,\u201d Scott wrote. \u201cThat was a mistake.\u201d\nScott marveled at how Google and OpenAI had built an entire infrastructure around their AI push. In the email, he said he was surprised Google and OpenAI had designed data centers, sourced silicon chips, and built programming frameworks to enable all their work, according to the email.\n\u201cWhen they took all of the infrastructure that they had built to build NLP [natural language processing] models that we couldn\u2019t easily replicate, I started to take things more seriously,\u201d Scott told Gates and Nadella.\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe advent of AI has put many of those resources in extremely high demand. AI requires extraordinary amounts of computing power to both run and train the models behind chatbots like Google\u2019s Gemini and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Data centers have become hot properties both as tech investments and as real-estate assets, with some of the biggest investment firms racing to corner the market. Silicon chips, or semiconductors, went through an unprecedented shortage as more and more companies tried to hoard them, fearing they\u2019d run out. Their importance is best exemplified by Nvidia\u2019s legendary stock surge over the past year. AI models also necessitated vast amounts of cloud computing, which companies like Google and Microsoft invested heavily in over the past decade.\nBut back in 2019, when he sent the email, Scott realized how important all these infrastructure upgrades were to developing the sort of AI that\u2019s now commonplace. \u201cAs I dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training, I got very, very worried,\u201d Scott said.\nScott says at the time that it took Microsoft about six months to train one of its AI models because \u201cour infrastructure wasn\u2019t up to the task.\u201d\nMicrosoft also realized it was lagging its competitors in terms of the personnel it had dedicated toward machine learning and AI research. Since then, employees well-versed in AI have found no shortage of job offers (some with million-dollar pay packages) from companies eager to hire them. The rush to hire AI talent would eventually spread beyond the tech sector to virtually every industry in the corporate world.\nMicrosoft, according to Scott, had some \u201cvery smart\u201d machine-learning experts, but they lacked the right resources and headcounts to make a notable dent in deep learning, the complex training mechanism used to develop AI models. That meant their work took longer than it should have, a worrying prospect amid the imminent AI arms race. \u201cWe are multiple years behind the competition in terms of [machine learning] scale,\u201d Scott said.\nMeanwhile, Nadella seemed to take Scott\u2019s extensive concerns to heart. Nadella cc\u2019ed chief financial officer Amy Hood and replied: This is \u201cwhy I want us to do this.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "The past year or so has been an exciting time to be a Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholder. The company was quick to recognize that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) would be game-changing, and it made a number of bold moves to position itself at the forefront of this technological shift.\nChief among those was the development of Microsoft Copilot, a suite of generative AI tools that integrate seamlessly into the company's other products and services, allowing people to automate an array of time-consuming tasks and helping them to be more productive.\nThese digital assistants are at the heart of Microsoft's new collection of AI-centric PCs, which the company just unveiled at its Build 2024 developer conference. Early reviews have been stunning.\nHere are three of the biggest upgrades in Microsoft's newest devices.\nMicrosoft's new Copilot+ PCs are endowed with the company's most advanced architecture yet, which brings together a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU, combined with over 40 on-device AI models, is designed to run a host of AI functions locally -- without having to interact with the cloud.\nThe company says that its Copilot+ PCs \"have the most powerful NPUs in the PC category today,\" capable of performing over 45 trillion operations per second (TOPS), helping support new AI functionality in its devices. Microsoft asserts that its Copilot PCs \"are up to 20x more powerful and up to 100x more efficient for running AI workloads and deliver industry-leading AI acceleration.\" The company also promises \"all-day battery life,\" thanks to the NPU's power efficiency.\nHaving the zippiest processing around wouldn't mean much if there weren't a flurry of new features to entice the user's imagination, and Microsoft didn't disappoint.\nHave you ever been stymied while looking for something you know is on your computer, but you simply can't find it? One of the more promising new features is dubbed Recall Instantly. Microsoft says the feature \"feels like having photographic memory.\" It can help users find documents, applications, websites, and more. By capturing and indexing what's on your screen, Recall can search for things with a simple prompt.\nCreative types will appreciate Cocreator, an AI-powered image-generation tool integrated with Paint. Artists can combine digital brush strokes with text prompts that describe what they want to compose, and Cocreator will do its best to lend them a helping hand. The tool also allows you to revise, refine, edit, and tweak its output until you're satisfied with the finished product.\nAnother handy feature is Live Captions. This on-device translation tool can listen to speech in more than 40 languages and translate what is said into English captions in real time.\nThese and other AI-powered tools promise to make the new Copilot+ PCs more useful.\nNaturally, Copilot+ PCs come equipped with Microsoft's AI-powered digital assistant, which users can summon with a tap of the Copilot key.\nMicrosoft also announced that Copilot was getting an upgrade courtesy of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released just last week. This will allow Copilot to interact with users via text and voice commands, but users can also upload videos, photos, and screenshots to get answers to related questions.\nThis means that Copilot will be imbued with all the capabilities of GPT-4o, which offers greater speed and performance than its predecessors.\nWhile Microsoft was quick to grab the AI opportunity, the competition is ramping up. However, with its AI-powered Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft has once again seized the high ground. The company isn't wasting any time: The new Copilot+ PCs will be available from Microsoft's biggest computer partners beginning on June 18, as will some Copilot+ Surface devices.\nMicrosoft stock has risen by 77% since the beginning of last year, more than twice the gain of the S&P 500. That isn't surprising since the stock has surged by 970% over the past decade, far outpacing the 182% gains of the broader market. Likewise, its total return of around 1,160% over that decade dwarfs the index's total return of 241%.\nThat said, Microsoft stock is still relatively inexpensive, trading at a valuation of 36 times forward expected earnings. While that's a premium to a multiple of 27 for the broad market index, Microsoft's track record shows why it's deserving of a premium.\nThat, combined with the significant opportunity represented by AI, helps illustrate why Microsoft stock is a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Milana Vinn ",
        "Text": "By Milana Vinn\n(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet's potential acquisition of HubSpot, a U.S. marketing software maker with a market value of $31 billion, would boost its ability to compete against Microsoft in offering cloud-based applications to companies.\nReuters reported last month that Google was exploring an offer for HubSpot. Such a deal would be Google's biggest, expanding its products and applications that serve businesses, analysts and investment bankers said in interviews.\nGoogle is already challenging the dominance of Microsoft's Office platform through its Google Workspace collaboration offerings. Buying HubSpot would make Google a competitor in the so-called customer relationship management sector, which Microsoft caters to with its Dynamics 365 products, said Cowen analyst Derrick Wood.\n\"It does appear that Google has aspirations to try to take market share from Microsoft in the productivity suite, and they can use HubSpot to bundle applications together for clients,\" Wood said.\nRepresentatives for Google, HubSpot and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.\nHubSpot, which makes marketing software for small and medium-sized businesses, is seeking ways to maintain sales growth in the face of a wider economic slowdown.\nHubSpot CEO Yamini Rangan said on the company's first-quarter earnings call this month that client demand had weakened, as small businesses fret about the economic impact of high interest rates.\nHubSpot has maintained growth despite clients downsizing, reporting a 23% rise in sales and 15% operating margin in the first quarter. However, equity analysts have warned that its shares would have taken a hit were it not for Google's acquisition interest.\nMost analysts covering HubSpot lowered their price target on the stock following its latest earnings report. Some have warned that the company's niche in serving smaller businesses, which sets it apart from bigger enterprise competitors such as Salesforce and Oracle, could become a weakness if a downturn makes financing harder to secure for those clients.\n\"Tighter lending standards could have an outsized negative impact on access to funding for small and medium-sized businesses (that are HubSpot's clients),\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note on May 9.\nHubSpot specializes in so-called \"inbound marketing,\" in which the consumer initiates engagement with a brand. HubSpot clients use its software to produce advertising content that consumers click on online or follow up on.\nInbound marketing largely relies on search engines and social media to attract customers and convert them into leads, offering many synergies with Google, whose parent Alphabet also owns popular video streaming service YouTube.\nWhile Microsoft has focused on attracting big corporate customers, Google has sought to also appeal to smaller companies, which make up the bulk of HubSpot's client base.\nAcquiring HubSpot would deliver Google a trove of valuable sales leads, filling a gap as it removes tracking applications known as \"cookies\" from its Chrome browser in the second half of 2024, said Stifel analyst Parker Lane.\n\"Purging third-party cookies from Chrome ... places a greater emphasis on first-party data, which HubSpot bring an abundance of to the table,\" Lane said.\nAI IN ADVERTISING\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and other executives have said that Google views advertising as a key route to making money off its advances in artificial intelligence.\n\"AI innovation across our ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types,\" Google's Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said during the company's first-quarter earnings call last month.\nGoogle clinching a deal for HubSpot would risk a challenge from antitrust regulators, even as many experts agree the tie-up would not curb competition given the lack of business overlap in the two companies. This is because of regulators' growing aversion to technology giants getting bigger through acquisitions.\nMorningStar analyst Dan Romanoff said Google could decide the potential deal's benefits outweigh the possibility of a regulatory challenge.\n\"Amazon is the clear leader in the cloud, Microsoft is No. 2 and Google is kind of distant third. One can imagine Google saying, 'If we buy HubSpot, that'd be like having Microsoft Dynamics 365, so it'll make us more competitive there,'\" Romanoff said.\n(Reporting by Milana Vinn in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Richard Chang)\n"

        "Author": "  Alice Nunwick ",
        "Text": "In its 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft revealed that its overall Scope 1-3 emissions were up 29% from 2020. The company admitted that the majority of these emissions had risen as a result of its global data centre expansion.\nMicrosoft has already invested $5.8bn into data centre expansion in 2023 alone according to research and analysis company GlobalData. It has already increased this investment in 2024 to exceed $23bn.\nIn 2020, Microsoft committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030. But is this goal achievable alongside its growing push on AI?\nIn its sustainability report, Microsoft stated that carbon reduction would continue to be a focus for the company and that new data centres were being built with optimised support for AI cooling and compute needs.\nDr. Leslie Kanthan, co-founder and CEO of software company TurinTech, described Microsoft\u2019s sustainability report as a \u201cwake up call\u201d to the wider tech sector.\n\u201cAs businesses rush to harness AI's immense potential in products, processes, and services, from marketing to software to customer support, we can no longer ignore the technology's massive environmental toll,\u201d he said.\nKanthan stated that while many people acknowledge the huge environmental impact of processing data training, it is not a holistic view of AI\u2019s full carbon footprint.\n\u201cAI's carbon footprint doesn't end at training; the emissions from ongoing inference to generate responses are also considerable,\u201d he explained, stating that energy-efficient code would also be needed to create eco-friendly AI.\n\u201cAs AI rapidly permeates every industry, companies must leverage innovative optimisation solutions to ensure GenAI delivers on its game-changing potential responsibly and sustainably,\u201d he concluded.\nHowever, Microsoft\u2019s sustainability report also centred AI as a tool in achieving its carbon goals.\nThe report identified that AI could be used to accurately map climate change, accelerate sustainable battery development and efficiently capture carbon emissions.\nMicrosoft also previously published a whitepaper in November 2023 outlining a five-point playbook into how AI can be used to benefit the environment.\nWhile its initial investment and data centre construction may have immediately increased Microsoft\u2019s carbon footprint, the long-term payoff of AI could help speed up its commitment to carbon reduction in the future.\nMauro Cozzi, CEO of carbon management platform Emitwise, told Verdict that it could be short-sighted to suggest that Microsoft\u2019s AI investment would continue to increase its emissions.\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s emissions increase is primarily due to its rapid growth, not AI investments,\u201d he explained, stating that it was important for companies to continue to invest in AI for global sustainability efforts.\nAdditionally, Cozzi suggested that the focus around Microsoft\u2019s increased emissions may be misplaced.\n\u201cRather than headlines focusing on Microsoft and its investment in AI, we\u2019d like to see more attention directed towards decarbonising traditional industries like cement and steel,\u201d Cozzi stated.\n\u201cIn fact, Microsoft deserves praise for taking proactive steps in addressing its supply chain emissions and promoting sustainability reporting among suppliers,\u201d he concluded, \u201cThis is what is truly essential for achieving sustainability goals.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s sustainability report details a number of partnerships it is part of, including one with the University of Washington to offset the carbon footprint of concrete.\nThe concrete industry currently accounts for 8% of the world\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, with 80% of that segment attributed to cement. Microsoft is conducting machine learning experiments with the University of Washington to generate formulas for concrete that use less cement while still meeting strength requirements.\nMicrosoft is also not alone in its pursuit of AI.\nBy 2030, GlobalData forecasts the total AI and cloud markets to be worth over $1,037bn and $1.4trn respectively.\nA 2024 survey conducted by GlobalData suggested that 27% of businesses who responded already had a high adoption rate of AI into their workflows.\nDemed L\u2019Her, chief technology officer at data management business DigitalRoute, explained the relationship between growing AI and cloud usage and the environment.\n\u201cThe move to AI and the cloud, and our increasing reliance on digital services, are fuelling an increase in use of energy and carbon emissions,\u201d he began, \u201cHowever, they are also commanding a much better use of resources. The concentration of computing power in fewer places has accelerated the demand for greater efficiency, storage density and cooling ability.\u201d\nL\u2019Her stated that a vast majority of the progress made in data centre infrastructure was down to genuine environmental concerns held by businesses.\n\u201cOrganisations can build in green measures which will limit the amount of digital waste created and bake in expiry dates by which dormant data will be deleted,\u201d he continued.\nWhile Microsoft\u2019s initial upfront investment into AI may have increased its emissions this year, it is still too early to determine if it has derailed its carbon reduction commitments.\n\"Explainer: is Microsoft\u2019s AI push collapsing its carbon commitment?\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

That's saying something for a company that's been trading for decades.\nIf some analysts are to be believed, there's more growth in store, and one analyst recently reiterated his bullish take on the company. But is that view realistic?\nIn mid-May, Piper Sandler's Brent Bracelin published a new research note on Microsoft in which he justified his existing overweight (read: buy) recommendation and $465 per-share price target. Bracelin's update comes on the heels of meetings with executives in Microsoft's security unit. The analyst wrote that following these meetings, he realized the strength of this somewhat unheralded business for the company.\nHe characterized security as \"an important growth vector,\" for the tech industry titan. According to his estimates, such offerings for Microsoft now comprise more than 10% of total sales, with around 1 million customers served.\n\"With the breadth of security portfolio across six unified families and vendor consolidation adoption drivers with up to 60% cost savings vs. point solutions, [Microsoft] appears well positioned to sustain growth in security,\" Bracelin wrote in his note.\nIt says something about a company that such a large division with a large customer base is flying under the radar of many investors. \"Security services\" isn't a term most of us readily identify with Microsoft, but per Bracelin's reading, it's really finding its niche -- not an easy achievement, given the many security specialists fighting for share these days.\nThe Piper Sandler pundit's price target is only 11% above the current share price. Given that, and Microsoft's strengths in so many areas (productivity software, cloud computing, AI, etc.), I think that might be quite conservative.

        "Title": "Some of the most talented, high-ranking workers at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX jumped ship after return-to-office mandates, new study reveals",
        "Author": "  Jane Thier ",
        "Text": "The focus of return-to-office discussions have long focused on the individuals. Why might workers prefer to stay home? Which age groups are most amenable to in-person work, and which are most combative? Does office collaboration make the most sense for creative types or heads-down numbers people? Can workers really be productive left to their own devices?\nYet the lingering question of how widespread remote work shapes company outcomes, as well as the wider sector landscape, largely remains unanswered because the whole experiment remains in flux. But a new working paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago, titled \u201cReturn to Office and the Tenure Distribution,\u201d comes fairly close to positing an answer: Return-to-office (RTO) mandates, when they\u2019re not wanted, are bad news for companies looking to keep their talent.\nThe researchers matched 260 million resumes to company data to analyze causal effects of RTO mandates on employees\u2019 tenure at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. In scientific terms, they found \u201ca reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure.\u201d In layman\u2019s terms: When the firms enacted RTO mandates, senior employees headed for the door\u2014often to direct competitors\u2014who let them work from home.\nThe number of top-brass employees at Microsoft\u2014as a share of the company headcount\u2014dropped by over 5% post-mandate; at Apple, it was 4%. (Microsoft mandated 50% of the week in-office; Apple, just one day a week.) SpaceX was the worst of the bunch, with a 15% drop, which the researchers chalk up to its uniquely stringent requirement: Five days a week in-person. That human outflow poses an enduring threat to \u201cproductivity, innovation, and competitiveness\u201d\u2014the component parts that separate a thriving company from one in freefall.\nMicrosoft\u2019s internal data doesn\u2019t align with the paper\u2019s findings, Amy Coleman, its vice president of human resources and corporate functions, told Fortune via email. The term \u201creturn to office mandate\u201d is also inaccurate, she said, adding that Microsoft is a hybrid workplace \u201cthat revolves around flexibility and a mix of workstyles across worksite, work location and work hours.\u201d In 2022, Microsoft\u2019s chief human resources officer Kathleen Hogan told Fortune the company considers \u201cworking from home up to 50% of the time as standard.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Apple and SpaceX did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment, though an Apple spokesperson told the Washington Post that the study drew \u201cinaccurate conclusions\u201d and \u201cdoes not reflect the realities\u201d of Apple\u2019s business or attrition rates.\nThe statistical analysis came from People Data Labs resum\u00e9 data, David Van Dijcke, a coauthor and University of Michigan economics PhD student, tells Fortune. \u201cThe takeaway is definitely that the effects [of RTO mandates] are more deleterious than people thought before.\u201d\nGranted, the study is far from all-encompassing; it only studied three major firms, and they were all \u201cearly movers\u201d in the RTO push, Van Dijcke acknowledges, pointing to each of their 2022 mandate announcements. That meant senior employees who left Microsoft, Apple, and SpaceX had \u201cpretty good outside options,\u201d namely competing companies that offered remote work with far fewer strings attached.\n\u201cIf we think of Covid as ending in 2022, that was certainly followed by an influx of people claiming they would leave\u2014and then really leaving when the first return-to-office mandates happened,\u201d Anthony Nyberg, a management professor at the University of South Carolina\u2019s Darla Moore School of Business, tells Fortune. \u201cApple and Microsoft really agonized over how to change their policies\u2014Amazon, too, made many public comments.\u201d\nTo be sure, Nyberg went on, mandating an office return is a major strategic decision\u2014and even in the Michigan study, which found a statistically significant portion of high-earning workers leaving, it remains unclear whether that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing for their former companies. \u201cA big part of this is likely to become a sorting effect in terms of talent finding their best-fit organizations,\u201d Nyberg says. \u201cAnd people going to competing companies has been a truism for all of eternity.\u201d\nPlus, especially within the tech industry, moving to a competitor that\u2019s offering to shell out more money is hardly much to write home about. Particularly if you work remotely, changing jobs is \u201cno more than getting a new laptop shipped to you,\u201d Nyberg says.\nA major asterisk to the data that Van Dijcke hopes people understand: Senior people may leave after a RTO more often, and in much greater numbers than entry- or mid-level workers, because senior leaders simply have more to gain. \u201cThey\u2019re older, they\u2019re more skilled, companies want to hire them for their expertise,\u201d Van Dijcke says; greener employees don\u2019t command the same sway. \u201cWe also saw that employees who leave aren't forced to accept suboptimal jobs\u2014demotions,\u201d he adds.\nEarlier literature shows a preference for fully remote jobs is lowest among the youngest employees, who have the most to gain from in-person collaborative work. \u201cThat seems to explain the pattern we observed\u2014that senior employees leave at higher rates,\u201d Van Dijcke says. \u201cThey have better options, and they also want to work from home more than junior employees do.\u201d\nEven so, no RTO mandate should come at the expense of the bottom line, Nyberg stresses. \u201cAs soon as an organization can no longer achieve its strategic directives, halt the RTO plan,\u201d he says. \u201cBut even during this period, these organizations keep enacting layoffs, which certainly suggests they\u2019re not in a people shortage yet. And layoffs are much more dangerous, broadly speaking.\u201d\nIndeed, layoffs, especially across Big Tech, often have long-term lagging effects, making workers likelier to leave due to disrupted culture and fractured trust. But mandates are pushing people out, too; poor morale might just be poor morale. (Ninety-nine percent of companies found a drop in employee satisfaction following their RTO mandate issuance, per a recent University of Pittsburgh study.)\nMany experts see the whole decision simply. \u201cAn organization is really hurting itself if it forces people to come back,\u201d Stephan Meier, chair of the Management Division at Columbia Business School, tells Fortune, adding he personally thinks the future will be hybrid. \u201cPeople are really motivated by having flexibility in how they organize their days. But a lot of leaders grew up in an in-office environment\u2014that was their way to control employees, that\u2019s how they thought the world worked, that\u2019s what worked for them and it\u2019s why they\u2019re on top.\u201d\nMandates, for the most part, miss the point; workers will come back on their own accord if they feel doing so would bring a material benefit\u2014or make it easier to deliver on their own work objectives.\nNonetheless, if a company is hellbent on having full offices\u2014even if that can only be accomplished by force\u2014Meier says \u201cnow is probably a better time [to enact a mandate] than two years ago,\u201d owing to the pressure of mass layoffs and dire economic uncertainty. But companies that roll out mandates, he stresses, are missing the point.\n\u201cBeing a leader means finding something that benefits everyone, and makes the firm run better,\u201d Meier says. And fears of depressed financial outcomes stemming from remote work are far overblown; underperformers existed long before the pandemic, and no change in work arrangements will necessarily create more of them. \u201cBefore quiet quitting, there was Microsoft solitaire\u2014a different way of phoning it in,\u201d Meier says.\nAll told, the findings in the report don\u2019t seem too egregious to Nyberg, the South Carolina professor, who\u2019s spent decades\u2014through financial crises and boom periods\u2014assessing the flow of human capital. \u201cBut then again, I\u2019m old.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Insight will be among the first to adopt Windows-based AI PCs with dedicated neural processing units (NPU) powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processors. The devices by Microsoft Surface, Dell, HP and Lenovo will feature the new Windows 11 always-on AI experience with a new version of Copilot+ that is contextually aware of on-device information.\nInsight, a Microsoft Solution partner holding a rare combination of designations for Security, Data & AI, and with a Managed XDR solution, is among a select few Microsoft partners participating in a technical adoption preview program for the next-gen Surface Laptop, also introduced Monday by Microsoft. During this pre-release proof of concept, performed across multiple business units, Insight will evaluate the device architecture by testing key features like native software performance, critical business app compatibility and deployment methodologies.\nInsight also is testing Windows-based AI PCs powered by AMD and Intel. Early results have shown benefits such as improved battery life and CPU performance, lower memory utilization, and enhanced end-user multitasking for generative AI workloads, images, voice recognition and predictive text processing.\n\"Every client we work with today is eager to adapt to generative AI and wants to know how to embrace one of the most transformative technologies ever,\" said Joyce Mullen, Insight president and CEO. \"Industry leaders like Microsoft and Qualcomm are making critical advances in AI and have entrusted Insight to be among the first to deploy and provide critical feedback on the next generation of PCs.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since early last year, it's become crystal clear that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are causing a paradigm shift in technology. Nowhere is that more evident than in the list of companies that are among the world's most valuable, measured in terms of market cap.\nMicrosoft made headlines over the past year or so with its definitive moves in generative AI and is currently the only company with a market cap above $3 trillion. Apple has been toying with AI for years, and while it ceded its market cap crown to Microsoft, it continues to cling stubbornly to second place, worth $2.9 trillion. Nvidia has moved up the ranks quickly thanks to its industry-leading AI-centric computer chips, currently worth $2.3 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms round out the other top 10 AI players, with market caps of between $2.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion.\nWith a market cap of roughly $789 billion (as of this writing), it seems clear that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is bucking for membership in this elite fraternity. Given the accelerating demand for the semiconductors needed for AI, TSMC's admittance might come sooner than later.\nAs the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC is in an enviable position in the industry. The company doesn't make semiconductors for its own use, but rather is contracted to make them for big tech companies, including Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others.\nOnce upon a time, the bulk of TSMC's revenue came from processors used in smartphones, but high-performance computing (HPC), which includes chips used for AI, has taken the top spot, recently accounting for 46% of revenue.\nBusiness is picking up. In the first quarter, revenue climbed 16.5% to $18.9 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 edged 5% higher. Management is expecting its accelerating growth to continue, forecasting second-quarter revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 28%.\nTSMC is in an enviable position in the AI revolution. It's a foundry partner to the AI stars, and since it makes chips for all comers, it's not a part of the fierce competition for AI chip supremacy. Given its position in the space and its current size, I don't think it will take very long to join the society of trillionaires.\nAccording to Wall Street, TSMC is poised to generate revenue of $84.8 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 9.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSM would have to grow its revenue to roughly $107 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nInterestingly, Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 22% in both 2024 and 2025. If the company achieves those fairly reasonable benchmarks, it could easily achieve a $1 trillion market cap by 2026.\nThere could be much more to come. TSM's management expects the company's AI-related revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the coming five years and account for 20% of TSM's total revenue by 2028.\nThat's not surprising, considering the magnitude of the opportunity. Generative AI is expected to generate economic value of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. However, estimates continue to ratchet higher as more applications for AI join the mix.\nFinally, at just 24 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors an inexpensive way to profit from the AI revolution.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been one of the clear early winners of the shift to artificial intelligence (AI). It was quick to recognize the potential implications and developed generative AI tools that are integrated across Microsoft's vast portfolio of products and services.\nDespite being the world's most valuable company (in terms of market cap), one Wall Street investment bank believes there's more upside to come.\nRBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria raised his price target on Microsoft to $500 while maintaining an outperform (buy) rating on the stock. For those keeping score at home, that represents potential upside of 18% compared to its closing price on Monday. Furthermore, with 7.4 billion shares outstanding, a $500 stock price would push Microsoft's market cap to $3.7 trillion.\nThe analyst cited a meeting with Microsoft's investor relations chiefs for fueling his bullish take. The discussion centered on the company's AI \"leadership\" and the vast opportunity ahead. It isn't surprising that AI was the main topic of conversation, especially given several announcements at this week's Microsoft Build 2024 developer conference.\nThe company introduced a new lineup of AI-powered devices, dubbed Copilot+ PCs, that will hit shelves next month. The company also expanded its Copilot lineup to include a version for Microsoft Teams, which aims to help users be more productive.\nThe evidence suggests the analysts are on to something. The company's flagship Copilot for Microsoft 365 was just the start. The company has quickly developed a roster of Copilots specifically designed for IT, sales, service, and finance, with more on the drawing board.\nMicrosoft's Azure Cloud is another example of an early lead in AI. Azure took market share from its cloud infrastructure rivals in each of the two most recent calendar quarters. Management noted that AI services \"contributed seven points\" to Azure's cloud growth in the quarter ended March 31.\nAt just 36 times forward earnings, Microsoft stock is a steal, particularly given its AI-fueled growth.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Joseph Ax ",
        "Text": "By Joseph Ax\n(Reuters) - Families of the victims of the 2022 elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, filed two lawsuits on Friday against Instagram's parent company Meta, Activision Blizzard and its parent Microsoft and the gunmaker Daniel Defense, claiming they cooperated to market dangerous weapons to impressionable teens such as the Uvalde shooter.\nTogether, the wrongful death complaints argue that Daniel Defense \u2013 a Georgia-based gun manufacturer \u2013 used Instagram and Activision's video game Call of Duty to market its assault-style rifles to teenage boys, while Meta and Microsoft facilitated the strategy with lax oversight and no regard for the consequences.\nMeta, Microsoft and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, a lobbying group representing the video game industry, said many other countries have similar levels of video game playing but less gun violence than the United States.\n\"We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence,\" the group said in a statement. \"At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies.\"\nIn one of the deadliest school shootings in history, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when an 18-year-old gunman armed with a Daniel Defense rifle entered Robb Elementary School and barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms with dozens of students.\nThe complaints were filed on the two-year anniversary of the massacre by Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the same law firm that reached a $73 million settlement with rifle manufacturer Remington in 2022 on behalf of families of children killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.\nThe first lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses Meta's Instagram of giving gun manufacturers \"an unsupervised channel to speak directly to minors, in their homes, at school, even in the middle of the night,\" with only token oversight.\nThe complaint also alleges that Activision's popular warfare game Call of Duty \"creates a vividly realistic and addicting theater of violence in which teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease,\" using real-life weapons as models for the game's firearms.\nThe Uvalde shooter played Call of Duty \u2013 which features, among other weapons, an assault-style rifle manufactured by Daniel Defense, according to the lawsuit \u2013 and visited Instagram obsessively, where Daniel Defense often advertised.\nAs a result, the complaint alleges, he became fixated on acquiring the same weapon and using it to commit the killings, even though he had never fired a gun in real life before.\nThe second lawsuit, filed in Uvalde County District Court, accuses Daniel Defense of deliberately aiming its ads at adolescent boys in an effort to secure lifelong customers.\n\"There is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting,\" Josh Koskoff, one of the families' lawyers, said in a statement. \"This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.\"\nDaniel Defense is already facing other lawsuits filed by families of some victims. In a 2022 statement, CEO Marty Daniel called such litigation \"frivolous\" and \"politically motivated.\"\nEarlier this week, families of the victims announced a separate lawsuit against nearly 100 state police officers who participated in what the U.S. Justice Department has concluded was a botched emergency response. The families also reached a $2 million settlement with the city of Uvalde.\nSeveral other suits against various public agencies remain pending.\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax and Katie Paul in New York and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Editing by Deepa Babington)\n"

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Symbiosis Coalition seeks to identify and scale next-generation nature restoration projects with a focus on certainty of climate impact\nThe Symbiosis Coalition aims to facilitate an advance market commitment (AMC) of up to 20 million tons of nature-based carbon removal credits. While only a fraction of the world's total carbon removal goals, this is the first and largest AMC ever for nature-based carbon removal, equivalent in volume to the 2030 carbon removal goals of the state of California. The goal of the Coalition is to send a strong demand signal to accelerate the development of high-impact, science-based restoration projects that will advance progress on global climate goals.\nSymbiosis will focus on catalyzing and scaling carbon projects that meet the highest quality bar for planet and people, integrating the most recent science and data on the climate impact of restoration while equitably involving and compensating Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\nThe Coalition will translate its goals into action by establishing and communicating clear quality criteria for nature-based carbon removal procurement efforts, engaging independent experts to continuously review these criteria in line with latest science and update them as needed, with the goal of creating a joint Request For Proposal (RFP) process to support Symbiosis offtake commitments, and paying the real cost necessary to enable these projects to happen.\nSymbiosis will transparently share lessons learned through these efforts with the broader public, rigorously monitor and evaluate impact from projects, and continually evolve its efforts as new data, science, and lessons arise to advance public confidence in nature\u2019s role in fighting climate change.\nNEW YORK, May 22, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce announce the Symbiosis Coalition, an advance market commitment for nature-based removal credits in the voluntary carbon market. These companies have collectively committed to contract up to 20 million tons in nature-based carbon removal credits by 2030 that have high certainty of impact on the climate and result in equitable outcomes for the communities whose livelihoods depend on these projects.\nNature restoration is essential to meeting the world\u2019s climate goals, but nature-based projects are complex and challenging to get right. Projects that integrate new technology and research to better measure outcomes, equitably engage Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and balance carbon sequestration benefits with other environmental co-benefits can come with significant cost. As a result, the nature-based carbon removal market has been hampered by a perceived lack of high-quality restoration projects and uncertainty around willingness to pay, keeping investors on the sidelines and eroding public trust in nature-based removal credits\u2019 potential for climate and social impact. The Coalition will help members address these challenges by facilitating the signing of long-term offtake agreements for projects that incorporate conservative assumptions on climate impact, draw on the best available science and practice, and equitably involve and compensate Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\nThrough a strong demand signal and a willingness to pay the real cost that it takes to develop these high-quality projects, Symbiosis intends to partner with like-minded investors, NGOs, market standard setters, and project developers to clarify the bar for what \"good\" restoration looks like and enable more of these projects to happen.\nWhile the aforementioned companies acknowledge the imperative to first reduce their own emissions, they also recognize the necessary role of a high-integrity carbon market and of nature protection and restoration in addressing climate change. A recent McKinsey analysis highlighted that carbon dioxide removal will likely require $6 trillion to $16 trillion of cumulative investment by 2050 to achieve net-zero goals. With under $15 billion invested in carbon removals to-date and under-investment in ecosystem protection and restoration, bold action is needed. Symbiosis will complement other critical, climate-focused AMCs that encourage investment in forest protection at the jurisdictional level and aim to scale the market for engineered carbon removals.\nGrowing something new\nSymbiosis intends to serve as an independent, non-profit joint procurement vehicle for nature-based carbon removal credits guided by five quality pillars: conservative accounting, durability, social and community benefits, ecological integrity, and transparency. These pillars will inform more specific quality criteria for the procurement of various nature-based project types, with an initial focus on forest and mangrove restoration.\nMembers will have the opportunity to purchase carbon removal credits that count towards their pledge through a joint RFP in addition to their own efforts. The initial RFP will focus on afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation projects (ARR), inclusive of agroforestry. Symbiosis will apply a set of criteria for ARR projects informed by a suite of independent technical advisors (acknowledged here) and that build on the most conservative standard for measuring real nature-based climate impact on the market today. These criteria emphasize:\nDynamic baselining to address additionality,\nRobust approaches to leakage, and\nPathways to creating durable, long lasting projects.\nIn addition, Symbiosis will prioritize projects that demonstrate financial transparency, greater biodiversity benefit, and equitable engagement and outcomes for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\nNature-based projects are complex and challenging to get right. With that in mind, the Coalition will transparently share lessons learned throughout the procurement process. Members will work collaboratively to rigorously evaluate project impact and align on potential remedies if projects underperform, whether directly engaging with a project developer to make changes, working with a registry to ensure that pooled buffer reserve carbon removal credits are canceled appropriately, or other novel solutions. Symbiosis will work with external experts to ensure that its quality criteria continually reflect the best available data and science on climate impact and to advance consistent and unified standards across the market.\nSymbiosis hopes to inspire other buyers to follow its standards and ultimately expand its membership to other companies. Symbiosis looks forward to collaborating with the broader restoration and carbon market ecosystem \u2013 investors, NGOs, standards bodies, project developers, researchers, and other stakeholders \u2013 to lay the foundation for a vibrant carbon market with nature at the forefront.\nKate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer at Google: \"Google is thrilled to join other Symbiosis founders and members to help grow the nature-based carbon removal market in a way that is firmly guided by science and has a measurable impact on the atmosphere. While we\u2019re first and foremost committed to reducing emissions from our operations and value chain, we recognize that won\u2019t be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. It\u2019s critical that we harness the power of both technology and nature to enable carbon removal at gigaton-scale and with the highest certainty of impact.\"\nBlair Swedeen, Global Head of Net Zero and Sustainability at Meta: \"We are excited to join other leading companies to signal our support for the highest quality carbon removal projects that have an impact for people and the planet. Reducing our emissions and helping to scale a robust carbon market that includes nature-based and technological carbon removal solutions are essential parts of achieving our sustainability goals, and we\u2019re proud to partner with our peers to help tackle the climate crisis.\"\nMelanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer at Microsoft: \"High-quality, nature-based solutions are vital to addressing climate change, and our work with the Symbiosis Coalition is a key step towards realizing our carbon negative goal by 2030 through a diversified portfolio of carbon removal. This collaboration will help build the overall market for these solutions, leading to more restoration purchases that benefit all of us. Continued investment in carbon removal is important not just to meet our goals but for the world to meet its goals.\"\nSuzanne DiBianca, EVP and Chief Impact Officer at Salesforce: \"Through effective collaboration, we can rapidly scale high quality nature-based credits and improve market integrity, driving significant benefits for both people and the planet. We're proud to be a founding member of Symbiosis, and are committed to our Nature Positive Strategy, emphasizing nature-based solutions including blue carbon projects, 1t.org, and empowering ecopreneurs. These initiatives highlight the critical role of diverse ecosystems in accelerating climate action to protect nature and biodiversity.\"\nJulia Strong, Executive Director of Symbiosis: \"Symbiosis represents a steadfast commitment to the importance of nature to climate action and the role of carbon markets, when done right, to financing critical climate solutions. These leading companies are committed to making restoration the most effective lever it can be in tackling climate change.

        "Author": "  Matt Day ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s newly named cloud chief, Matt Garman, inherits a $100-billion-a-year business that\u2019s as profitable as it has ever been. He also faces the daunting task of retaining the cloud-computing pioneer\u2019s edge in the artificial intelligence age.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site\nEbrahim Raisi, Iranian President Confronting West, Dies at 63\nSpeedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge\nSaudi Crown Prince Postpones Japan Trip Over King\u2019s Health\nChina\u2019s Housing Rescue Too Small to End Crisis, Analysts Say\nA longtime Amazon Web Services engineering leader who was most recently sales chief, Garman, 48, will assume one of the most prominent positions in the technology industry when he succeeds Adam Selipsky next month.\nSelipsky, who has led AWS since 2021, will relinquish the role on June 3 \u201cto move onto his next challenge,\u201d Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday.\nThe cloud unit, the world\u2019s largest seller of rented computing power and data storage, has long accounted for most of Amazon\u2019s operating income, serving as a cash machine that gives the parent company flexibility to make big investments in other areas.\nBut AWS struggled in the last two years when businesses trimmed their technology spending following pandemic-era splurges. The cloud unit\u2019s growth slowed to a record low last year, which executives attributed in part to Amazon\u2019s own efforts to help customers save money. The unit held its largest-ever layoffs a year ago and has continued trimming since, even as it continues to hire for specific areas.\nThe division also stumbled out of the gate in the race to commercialize a new generation of artificial intelligence services, lagging behind rivals Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google in bringing to market the systems that power such products as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nEarly versions of AWS\u2019s AI products were deemed insufficient by some customers. Since then, the company has invested $4 billion in Anthropic, a well-regarded builder of generative AI tools. AWS is also building its own tools to rival ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers.\nSo while Microsoft and Google are widely seen as leaders in generative AI \u2014 which responds to users\u2019 prompts with newly created text, voice or images \u2014 Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related business for years to come.\n\u201cRegardless of how much or how little Adam Selipsky is responsible for AWS\u2019s progression in AI, as CEO, he owns the outcome,\u201d said Corey Quinn, the chief cloud economist at the Duckbill Group, a consulting firm that advises AWS clients. \u201cAnd the outcome has not been terrific.\u201d\nSelipsky, 57, said in a note to employees that he would \u201ctake the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities.\u201d A spokesperson for AWS declined to comment beyond the executives\u2019 memos.\nSelipsky was Jassy\u2019s right hand during the cloud group\u2019s early years, serving in a chief operating officer-like capacity that saw him lead sales, marketing and other roles. He left in 2016 to run Tableau, a Seattle builder of data visualization tools later sold to Salesforce Inc., before returning three years ago. His second stint at Amazon was a surprise to many AWS employees who had expected the job to go to Garman.\nGarman interned at Amazon in 2005 while still in business school at Northwestern University, and joined full-time the following year, helping to launch some of the first AWS products. He went on to run engineering teams working on Amazon\u2019s on-demand computing power services, and began leading AWS\u2019s sales and marketing teams in 2020, a sign to close watchers of the company that he was being groomed for the top job.\nPracticed Humility\nPeople who\u2019ve worked with Garman describe him as a detail-oriented engineering manager in the Amazon mold, brimming with self-confidence and a practiced humility when dealing with customers or entering new markets. Like many of Amazon\u2019s senior executives, he\u2019s not considered a polished public speaker or gladhander. Garman doesn\u2019t shy away from confrontation, challenging the assumptions of product teams in meetings and drilling down on specific data points.\n\u201cMatt has an unusually strong set of skills and experiences for his new role,\u201d said Jassy, who led AWS from its inception in the early 2000s until he was named to Amazon\u2019s top job in 2021. \u201cHe\u2019s very customer focused, a terrific product leader, inventive, a clever problem-solver, right a lot, has high standards and meaningful bias for action.\u201d\nGarman said he\u2019ll announce organizational changes in the coming weeks. One arrived on Tuesday: Amazon\u2019s sustainability teams, which had reported to Selipsky, will move to communications chief Drew Herdener\u2019s organization.\nShortly after he started at AWS, Garman was asked by a business school pal who worked in another Amazon unit how things were going at AWS, which at the time was a counterintuitive bet by an online retailer. Garman replied that he thought AWS would someday be a $1 billion business. His friend scoffed, Garman told Bloomberg in 2019.\nBy the time AWS publicly disclosed its sales almost a decade after that conversation, AWS was on track for almost $8 billion in annual sales.\n\u201cWe thought it would take a lot longer,\u201d Garman said.\n(Updates with background throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "Text": "It\u2019s been a solid start to the week for France.\nOfficials announced today that the country has bagged \u20ac15 billion ($16.2 billion) in investments from multinational companies ranging from tech to pharmaceuticals, helping bolster its business landscape.\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Morgan Stanley, Sanofi and more are planning to pump investments into their French businesses as part of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cChoose France\u201d summit on Monday.\nThis is a serious amount to announce in one day, even for a country that typically receives substantial foreign direct investment (FDI), like France. To put it in perspective, in 2022, which was a particularly strong year, the country received $36.4 billion FDI inflow in 2022, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\nThe Choose France event, now in its seventh year, positions France as a leading hub for global business.\nThis year, in one of its most significant FDI announcements, a total of 56 projects were added.\nMicrosoft, for instance, has committed \u20ac4 billion ($4.3 billion) to build its cloud and AI capabilities to train a million people and help 2,500 startups grow over the next three years. Fellow tech giant Amazon also unveiled new investments worth $1.3 billion.\nFrench pharma company Sanofi has plowed \u20ac1 billion ($1 billion) into the country to expand drug production. Its peers Pfizer and AstraZeneca also said they\u2019d invest close to $1 billion in France.\n\u201cThis new investment will create more than 500 jobs and significantly strengthen France\u2019s ability to control the production of essential medicines from start to finish, for the present day and into the future,\u201d Sanofi said in a statement Monday.\nMajor banks like Morgan Stanley and First Abu Dhabi Bank are among the others that have investments lined up.\nFrance typically receives among the highest inward FDI in Europe, with the second-highest total in 2022, behind Sweden, according to UNCTAD.\nHowever, its total stock of foreign investments still trails Britain\u2019s: France\u2019s inward FDI stock was $897 billion that year, equal to just under one-third of its GDP, while the U.K. clocked $2.7 trillion.\nGermany\u2019s inward FDI stock was just over $1 trillion, representing a smaller share of its economy than France or the U.K.\nThe FDI flurry announced today comes as France doubles down on improving its attractiveness for business.\nFamous for its wine and gastronomy, the country has a diversified economy with strengths including pharmaceuticals, finance, aerospace, and automotive manufacturing. Paris has more Fortune Global 500 company headquarters than rival London, and numerous financial institutions have transferred operations there from the U.K. capital since Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the EU.\nWhile France still faces economic challenges like high labor costs and a relatively tight tax regime, these clearly haven\u2019t deterred investors. With billions in the pipeline for investment and thousands of jobs set to be created across industries, global businesses are voting with their wallets.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "At this year's Build event, Microsoft has announced Team Copilot, and as you can probably guess from its name, it's a variant of the company's AI tool that can cater to the needs of a group of users. It expands Copilot's abilities beyond that of a personal assistant, so that it can serve a whole team, a department or even an entire organization, the company said in its announcement. The new tool was designed to take on time-consuming tasks to free up personnel, such as managing meeting agenda and taking down minutes that group members can tweak as needed.\nTeam Copilot can also serve as a meeting moderator by summarizing important information for latecomers (or for reference after the fact) and answering questions. Finally, it can create and assign tasks in Planner, track their deadlines, and notify team members if they need to contribute to or review a certain task. These features will be available in preview across Copilot for Microsoft 365 \u2014 and will be accessible by those paying for its license \u2014 starting later this year.\nIn addition to Team Copilot, Microsoft has also announced new ways customers can personalize the AI assistant. Custom copilots users create from SharePoint can be edited and improved further in Copilot Studio, where they can also make custom copilots that act as agents. The latter would allow companies and business owners to automate business processes, such as end-to-end order fulfillment. Finally, the debut of Copilot connectors in Studio will make it easier for developers to build Copilot extensions that can customize the AI tools' actions.\nUpdate, May 21, 2024, 1:24AM ET: This story has been updated to clarify that Team Copilot is an assistant that can serve the needs of a group of users and is separate from Copilot for Teams.\n"

This marks a noteworthy increase from previous surveys and points to robust market confidence in Microsoft's AI offerings.\n\u201cGiven the increased AI component to cloud workloads and MSFT's over-indexing as the early AI beneficiary, this survey screens most positive for MSFT,\u201d analysts continued.\nMicrosoft's advantage is further reflected in the projected growth of public cloud spending attributed to AI. Currently, 5% of public cloud spending is related to AI/ML, but this is expected to grow to 12% over the next three years.\nThe survey also highlighted that about 50% of AI spending is expected to come from new IT budgets, a positive indicator for overall IT budget expansion.\n\"The dollars for AI are coming from a combination of new and existing budgets, largely accruing to MSFT in the early days,\" the report notes.\nMoreover, the study implies that other tech giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also poised to benefit from AI integration, albeit to a lesser extent. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is seen as gaining significant traction, with 18% of CIOs expecting GCP to gain the largest incremental share of AI/ML spend over the next three years.\nRelated Articles\nMorgan Stanley's survey shows Microsoft remains the early AI leader\nStocks regain some ground, bonds steady after rate angst sell-off\nSalesforce plummets as weak forecast sparks concerns of AI competition\n"

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "This year already saw two new companies' market caps surpass $2 trillion, and a third is poised to hit that milestone.\nThe current members of the $2 trillion club are some of the most well-respected names in their fields, and all of their businesses revolve around technology.\nMicrosoft ($3 trillion) established itself as an AI leader with a smart investment in OpenAI. Its Azure cloud computing platform and enterprise software business reap the benefits.\nApple ($2.8 trillion) sells the iPhone and operates a growing services ecosystem built around its devices.\nNvidia ($2.2 trillion) sits at the forefront of the AI trend as a supplier of the most sought-after chips for large language model training.\nAlphabet ($2.1 trillion) owns the most popular search engine, Google, operating a massive advertising business, and one of the biggest cloud computing platforms in the market.\nThe next company likely to join them also heavily invested in tech, including cloud computing and digital advertising. But its core business, retail, also shows a ton of potential for earnings growth. That company is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\nThree important pieces of Amazon's business are benefiting from various trends. But investors shouldn't discount the operational excellence that Amazon's management team exhibited to take advantage of those trends.\nAmazon is a key player in the booming AI trend. As demand for generative AI capabilities expands, cloud computing segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) is building out its capabilities to meet that demand.\nCEO Andy Jassy says he likes to think of AI development in three layers. At the base layer, Amazon offers developers compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and its own custom Trainium 2 chips. It also offers a service, SageMaker, that makes training a large language model easier by managing customer training data. In the middle layer, it offers Amazon Bedrock for anyone looking to build on top of existing large language models. Developers can expand on existing models and build custom AI apps using Bedrock's tool set. At the top layer are existing AI-powered applications running on the cloud.\nAll three layers have contributed to the reacceleration of Amazon Web Services' revenue growth. The segment's revenue run rate surpassed $100 million in the first quarter.\nThe second trend is digital advertising. Despite how prevalent digital advertising is these days, it remains an opportunity for Amazon. The company saw great success with its sponsored product listings. In January, it started including video ads in Prime Video by default, adding another opportunity for sales growth. That said, management still says it thinks there are growth opportunities in its core display ad business.\nIts advertising revenue climbed 24% year over year last quarter, and exceeded $49 billion over the trailing 12 months.\nAmazon's original business, online retail, remains a big opportunity. Despite relatively slow growth for online store sales, third-party seller services, and subscription services (which mostly consists of Prime memberships), the real story is its expanding operating margin. North American operating margin climbed to 5.8% from 1.2% a year ago. That margin expansion was fueled by more efficient shipping operations as Amazon overhauled its logistics network. International operating income turned positive in the first quarter, a major milestone for the company.\nSmall improvements in operating margin go a long way when a business generates $500 billion per year in revenue.\nAs of this writing, Amazon's market cap sits just shy of $2 trillion. The stock needs to gain just 3% for the company to reach that milestone, and that could happen any day. Given the significant trends lifting its business and its operational successes, it shouldn't take long for the market to push it over the top.\nThat's especially true considering that the stock trades at a fair valuation. Its enterprise-value-to-sales ratio is 3.2, and analysts on average expect 11% sales growth both this year and next year.

        "Text": "Friday, May 17, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), as well a micro-cap stock Koss Corp. (KOSS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Microsoft\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+33.2% vs. +31.4%). The company\u2019s fiscal third-quarter results gained from strong growth in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and a rise in AI Copilot business.However, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+32.7% vs. +16.7%). The company\u2019s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Taltz and others. Lilly\u2019s new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity medicine, Zepbound, are seeing exceptionally strong demand trends.Lilly has also launched some other new products expected to drive Lilly\u2019s top line in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s.However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Zepbound and Mounjaro are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)Costco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+64.0% vs. +31.4%). The company, being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well.The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers.This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.(You can read the full research report on Costco here >>>)Shares of Koss have outperformed the Zacks Audio Video Production industry over the past year (+24.5% vs. -14.2%). The company maintains financial stability with $2.9 million in cash and $7 million in short-term investments. Its focus on innovation, cost management, and quality ensures that it remains competitive, while its global presence and customer loyalty offer avenues for growth.However, Koss faces challenges in a competitive, evolving earphone market dominated by giants like Sony and Bose. Market saturation and aggressive competition threaten to erode Koss's share and profitability.Financially, Koss reported a revenue decline to $9.4 million from $10 million year-over-year, signaling issues in production cost management and pricing strategies. Legal disputes over patents add financial and reputational risks. Additionally, reliance on Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers exposes Koss to geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions.(You can read the full research report on Koss here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include United Parcel Service, Inc.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock Set to Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has a century-long track record of producing the world's most valuable companies:\nUnited States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company in 1901.\nBy 1955, General Motors became the first $10 billion company.\nIndustrial giant General Electric rode its portfolio of businesses -- from aerospace to financial services -- to a $100 billion valuation in 1995.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) crossed the next big threshold in 2018 when it became the first publicly traded company to amass a $1 trillion market capitalization.\nToday, Apple is joined by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia in the trillion-dollar club. But I think one more company is on the cusp of earning membership.\nWarren Buffett has led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) to a whopping 4,384,748% return since 1965, giving it a valuation of nearly $900 billion. The conglomerate owns substantial positions in private and public success stories like GEICO, Coca-Cola, and even Apple.\nHere's why Berkshire could become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club within the next 12 months.\nBuffett is a quintessential value investor. He likes to buy good businesses at a cheap price, and sometimes great businesses at a fair price, with the intention of holding on to them for decades. He looks for companies with steady growth, consistent profitability, and strong management teams. He especially likes businesses that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\nHere's an example that perfectly displays the effects of compounding that helped Buffett build his empire. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of American Express (NYSE: AXP) between 1991 and 1995. That holding has grown in value to a staggering $36.8 billion today. Even better, Amex stock makes Berkshire money just for owning it, paying Berkshire $364 million in dividends in 2023 alone. That dividend means Berkshire recoups its entire initial investment in Amex every four years just from the dividends. That's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories.\nBerkshire was originally a textiles business, and it was on the verge of failure when Buffett stepped in to buy it in 1965. When he realized he couldn't turn it around, he transformed it into a holding company for various investments.\nSince then, Berkshire has purchased many companies outright, including GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen. But it also owns a portfolio of 47 publicly traded stocks and securities worth $377.9 billion. This portfolio includes its shares of Amex, Coca-Cola, and Apple.\nApple is Berkshire's single largest holding, with a value of $149.9 billion accounting for 39.7% of its stock portfolio. It would be even larger, but the conglomerate recently sold 13% of its position (reportedly for tax reasons). Considering Berkshire only spent around $38 billion accumulating Apple shares since 2016, this investment has seriously paid off.\nI want to take a moment to highlight the Coca-Cola stake, too. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion buying shares of the beverage giant between 1988 and 1994, and it has never sold any of them. Today, that position is worth $25.2 billion, and it paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023 alone.\nYou might notice the Coca-Cola story sounds very similar to the Amex story, and its is. What it points out is that Buffett didn't catch lightning in a bottle, nor is his strategy exceptional. In fact, Berkshire's long-term positions in Bank of America, Visa, and Moody's followed a similar trajectory, thanks to Buffett's simple formula centered around patient investing.\nIf investors are willing to maintain a long-term view, they can also reap the benefits of compounding in the same way.\nBerkshire Class A shares soared in value by 4,384,748% between 1965 and 2023. That translates into a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is nearly twice the 10.2% average annual return in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\nThe outperformance is mind-boggling in dollar terms. An investment of $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth $43.8 million at the end of 2023! The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $312,230.\nBerkshire has the financial results to support its incredible returns. The business generated $49.3 million in revenue during 1965, a figure which grew to $364.4 billion last year. Berkshire's diverse portfolio of businesses contributed to the latter number: $83.4 billion came from insurance premiums; $101.4 billion came from its railroad, utilities, and energy businesses; and $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various entities under Berkshire's umbrella.\nBerkshire also grew its net earnings from just $2.3 million in 1965 to a whopping $96.2 billion in 2023.\nConsidering Berkshire has a market capitalization of nearly $900 billion as of this writing, its stock only needs to gain 11% from here to catapult the company into the $1 trillion club. Its 58-year-long track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns (on average) suggests it's a shoo-in to get there within the next 12 months.\nA few things will work in Berkshire's favor going forward. For starters, Apple just announced a $100 billion stock buyback, which is the largest in the history of corporate America. That will organically increase the conglomerate's equity stake in the iPhone maker. Plus, top holdings like Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola continue to raise their dividends, so Berkshire will likely earn a record payout this year.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is also likely to cut interest rates in the second half of 2024. That could spark an increase in economic activity which should boost many of the businesses in Berkshire's portfolio, especially those serving consumers and those in the transport and logistics industries.\nFinally, Buffett continues to be a big believer in the company's future. He authorized the repurchase of $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023 and a further $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Buffett has now overseen $71.4 billion worth of share repurchases since 2020 alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock.\nAbsent any external economic shocks, Berkshire appears almost certain to be the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club in the coming year.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $584,435!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden chided Donald Trump during a visit to swing-state Wisconsin, championing a major Microsoft Corp. investment at the same site his 2024 rival\u2019s plans for a flagship technology project by Foxconn fizzled.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind\nGameStop Shares Soar as \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Revitalizes Meme Mania\nChina to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy\nTesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk\u2019s Cuts\nBiden said the Foxconn investment heralded by his predecessor turned out to be \u201ca con,\u201d mocking the former president for failing to deliver on promises to bring high-paying jobs to the state and boost domestic manufacturing.\nBiden was joined at the event by Microsoft President Brad Smith to announce a $3.3 billion plan by the company to build an artificial intelligence data center at a site in Racine County, Wisconsin. The facility will be built on land once chosen for a massive investment by Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn. Trump attended a groundbreaking in 2018, citing it as a centerpiece of his efforts to bring more manufacturing jobs to the US.\n\u201cHe came here with your Senator Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build \u2018the eighth wonder of the world,\u2019 Biden said Wednesday. \u201cThey dug a hole with those golden shovels and they fell into it.\u201d\nFoxconn, a supplier for Apple Inc., had agreed to build the tech manufacturing hub on farmland south of Milwaukee and create as many as 13,000 high-paying jobs. But the effort has been heavily scaled back, hit by delays and shifting plans. A state agency says it has created just over 1,000 jobs so far.\n\u201cMy predecessor made promises. He broke more than he kept, leaving a lot of people behind and communities like Racine behind. On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises,\u201d Biden said.\nSmith, who grew up in the state, also alluded to Foxconn\u2019s struggles, saying it was important for companies to \u201cunderpromise, overdeliver and work with the community\u201d on investment projects.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way to do business here,\u201d he added.\nFoxconn said in a statement that it had invested around $1 billion in Wisconsin, and that it had helped back bonds to build the infrastructure for other technology companies to set up shop in the state.\n\u201cWe are proud of the over 1,000 men and women who work at Foxconn Wisconsin,\u201d the company said.\nBiden has touted bipartisan legislation on infrastructure and semiconductor subsidies that he says brought new investments to communities across the US and spurred a renaissance in domestic manufacturing. It\u2019s a bid to distinguish his record from that of Trump, who he says watched as American jobs went to China.\nYet that message has proved a difficult sell as polls show voters skeptical of Biden\u2019s handling of the economy and willing to give his predecessor more credit for his stewardship.\nWisconsin is one of the battleground states where that question will be settled in November. An April Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll showed Biden trailing Trump in key swing-states likely to determine the outcome of the election. In Wisconsin, the poll found Trump with a 4 percentage point lead. In March, the same poll had Biden leading by 1 point.\nEarlier: Biden\u2019s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism\nThe trip is Biden\u2019s fourth visit to Wisconsin this year \u2014 a marker of its importance. Trump carried the state by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 and Biden flipped it in 2020, also winning it narrowly.\nBiden has stepped up his travel to battleground states in recent weeks hoping to capitalize on his opponent\u2019s legal woes. Trump has been largely sidelined with his criminal trial involving hush-money payments to an adult film star underway in Manhattan. The presumptive Republican nominee is required to be in the courtroom for the proceedings, limiting his ability to campaign on weekdays.\nBiden is scheduled to visit Chicago for a fundraiser later Wednesday as he looks to build up his cash advantage over Trump.

        "Text": "Temenos announced the results of a sustainability benchmark for its cloud-native banking platform running on Microsoft Azure, demonstrating the efficiency of handling the variable demands of digital transactions while also supporting banks to meet their sustainability goals.\nThe Microsoft benchmark simulated a client using Temenos Retail Enterprise Services with 25 million customers and 38 million accounts, processing 12 million loans on a single instance. Having previously set a record highwater benchmark for the volume of transactions per second (TPS), this latest benchmark showed the advances in Temenos\u2019 leaner and more sustainable architecture, with up to 52% like-for-like efficiency improvement for the tested workloads compared to the previous release.\nFrom a 2021 baseline, Temenos has reduced the carbon impact of its software by over 50%. Improving the performance with more efficient code and leaner architecture means less demand for infrastructure, less processing power needed and consequently less energy consumed and lower carbon emissions. Combined with Temenos sustainable operations and the sustainability of hyperscaler partners like Microsoft, this brings added environmental benefits for banks choosing to deploy Temenos solutions on public cloud or as SaaS.\nTony Coleman, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, Temenos, commented: \u201cThe sustainability benchmark on Microsoft Azure shows the unmatched speed and efficiency of Temenos\u2019 cloud-native platform helping banks to decarbonise their operations and grow their businesses sustainably. Over the years Temenos has worked hard investing considerable R&D to get the best out of the cloud with a platform and solutions that are fully cloud-native. With a leaner and greener architecture, Temenos is by far the most sustainable way to run core banking in the cloud.\u201d\nChristian Sarafidis, Chief Executive EMEA Financial Services, Microsoft, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to see our collaboration with Temenos continue to set new standards for core banking in the cloud. Temenos and Microsoft have a strategic relationship to meet the growing demand from banks for cloud and SaaS banking services.

By creating an interconnect based upon open standards, UALink will enable system OEMs, IT professionals and system integrators to create a pathway for easier integration, greater flexibility and scalability of their AI-connected data centers.\nThe Promoter Group companies bring extensive experience creating large-scale AI and HPC solutions based on open standards, efficiency and robust ecosystem support.\nDriving Scale-Up for AI Workloads\nAs the demand for AI compute grows, it is critical to have a robust, low-latency and efficient scale-up network that can easily add computing resources to a single instance. Creating an open, industry standard specification for scale-up capabilities will help to establish an open and high-performance environment for AI workloads, providing the highest performance possible.\nThis is where UALink and an industry specification becomes critical to standardize the interface for AI and Machine Learning, HPC, and Cloud applications for the next generation of AI data centers and implementations. The group will develop a specification to define a high-speed, low-latency interconnect for scale-up communications between accelerators and switches in AI computing pods.\nThe 1.0 specification will enable the connection of up to 1,024 accelerators within an AI computing pod and allow for direct loads and stores between the memory attached to accelerators, such as GPUs, in the pod. The UALink Promoter Group has formed the UALink Consortium and expects it to be incorporated in Q3 of 2024. The 1.0 specification is expected to be available in Q3 of 2024 and made available to companies that join the Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) Consortium.\nAbout Ultra Accelerator Link\nUltra Accelerator Link (UALink) is a high-speed accelerator interconnect technology that advances next-generation AI/ML cluster performance.

Gates reportedly bought the land\u00a0for $2 million in 1988\u00a0and spent seven years and\u00a0$63 million building\u00a0the home. What do you get for that? How\u00a0about six kitchens, a 25,000-square-foot gym, a trampoline room, a\u00a0steam room, a\u00a0sauna\u00a0and\u00a0an artificial stream with sand imported from the\u00a0Caribbean.\u00a0For starters.\nApproximate Cost:\u00a0$40 million\nAlthough Gates is committed to shrinking his carbon footprint, the billionaire owns more than one private jet, including this\u00a0ultra-long distance\u00a0model.

        "Title": "Microsoft debuts 'Copilot+' PCs with AI features",
        "Author": "  Max A. Cherney ",
        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nSEATTLE (Reuters) -Microsoft on Monday debuted a new category of personal computers with AI features as it rushes to build the emerging technology into products across its business and compete with Alphabet and Apple.\nAt an event on its campus in Redmond, Washington, Chief Executive Satya Nadella introduced what Microsoft calls \"Copilot+\" PCs, saying that it and a range of manufacturers would sell them, including Acer and Asustek Computer.\nMicrosoft launched the laptops as its shares trade near record highs following a Wall Street rally driven by expectations that AI will fuel strong profit growth for the company and its Big Tech rivals.\nAble to handle more artificial-intelligence tasks without calling on cloud data centers, the new computers will start at $1,000 and begin shipping on June 18.\nThe ability to crunch AI data directly on the computer lets Copilot+ include a feature called \"Recall.\" \"Recall\" tracks everything done on the computer, from Web browsing to voice chats, creating a history stored on the computer that the user can search when they need to remember something they did, even months later.\nThe company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the \"Minecraft\" video game.\nYusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\nGlobal PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.\n\"People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,\u201d said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.\nMicrosoft's new \"Copilot+\" computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the \"Ultrabook\" category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple's MacBook Air.\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Copilot.\nMicrosoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. It also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.\nMicrosoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before its annual developer conference.\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as they race to dominate the field.\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\nWindows PC makers have been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips.\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Title": "Microsoft's AI chatbot will 'recall' everything you do on a PC",
        "Author": "  MATT O'BRIEN, MANUEL VALDES ",
        "Text": "REDMOND, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Microsoft wants laptop users to get so comfortable with its artificial intelligence chatbot that it will remember everything you're doing on your computer and help figure out what you want to do next.\nThe software giant on Monday revealed a new class of AI-imbued personal computers as it confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\nThe announcements ahead of Microsoft's annual Build developer conference centered on fusing its AI assistant, called Copilot, into the Windows operating system for PCs, where Microsoft already has the eyes of millions of consumers.\nThe new features will include Windows Recall, giving the AI assistant what Microsoft describes as \u201cphotographic memory\u201d of a person's virtual activity. Microsoft promises to protect users' privacy by giving them the option to filter out what they don't want tracked, and keeping the tracking on the device.\nIt's a step toward machines that \u201cinstantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,\u201d said CEO Satya Nadella.\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering this new era where computers not only understand us, but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent,\" Nadella said at an event at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington.\nThe conference that starts Tuesday in Seattle follows big AI announcements last week from rival Google, as well as Microsoft's close business partner OpenAI, which built the AI large language models on which Microsoft's Copilot is based.\nGoogle rolled out a retooled search engine that periodically puts AI-generated summaries over website links at the top of the results page; while also showing off a still-in-development AI assistant Astra that will be able to \u201csee\u201d and converse about things shown through a smartphone\u2019s camera lens.\nChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled a new version of its chatbot last week, demonstrating an AI voice assistant with human characteristics that can banter about what someone's wearing and even attempt to assess a person\u2019s emotions. The voice sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson playing an AI character in the sci-fi movie \u201cHer\u201d that OpenAI dropped the voice from its collection Monday.\nOpenAI also rolled out a new desktop version of ChatGPT designed for Apple's Mac computers.\nNext up is Apple's own annual developers conference in June. Apple CEO Tim Cook signaled at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in February that it has been making big investments in generative AI.\nSome of Microsoft's announcements Monday appeared designed to blunt whatever Apple has in store. The newly AI-enhanced Windows PCs will start rolling out on June 18 on computers made by Microsoft partners Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, as well as on Microsoft's Surface line of devices. But they'll be reserved for premium models starting at $999.\nWhile Copilot is rooted in OpenAI's large language models, Microsoft said the new AI PCs will also rely heavily on its own homegrown \u201csmall language models\u201d that are designed to be more efficient and able to more easily run on a consumer's personal device.\nPowered by Qualcomm chips, many of the computers will end up in the hands of workers at big organizations looking to refresh their inventory, said Gartner analyst Jason Wong.\nAI applications from graphics production to language translation \u201ccan now run locally without having to go back to the cloud to process it,\u201d said Wong. \u201cThat\u2019s going to help with what you can do without connected internet, and make it that much more high-performing.\u201d\n\u2014-\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n"
