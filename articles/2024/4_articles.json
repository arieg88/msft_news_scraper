        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) shares rose on Friday after it reported its fiscal third quarter earnings, beating analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines on the strength of its cloud computing business.\n\u201cMicrosoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.\nMicrosoft said on Thursday that its AI services contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue. That's up from 6 percentage points in Q2, and 3 points in Q1. Microsoft first broke out its AI percentage contributions to Azure in Q4 last year, saying it added 1 percentage point to Azure revenue at the time.\nThe company also said it anticipates Q4 revenue of between $63.5 billion and $64.5 billion, just a head of analysts' expectations of $64.7 billion.\nMicrosoft CFO Amy Hood said during the company's earnings call that the tech giant is seeing near term AI demand outstrip available capacity.\nShares of Microsoft were up about 2% on Friday.\nMicrosoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.94 on revenue of $61.9 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $2.83 on revenue of $60.88 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nMicrosoft's overall commercial cloud revenue came in at $35.1 billion, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $33.93 billion. On a segment bases, Microsoft saw Productivity and Business Processes revenue of $19.57 billion, beating expectations of $19.54 billion. Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing revenue came in at $26.71 billion and $15.58 billion, respectively. That was better than the $26.25 billion and $15.07 billion analysts expected, respectively.\nThe revenue beat in More Personal Computing was driven by 11% growth in Windows OEM sales to PC manufacturers and 62% growth in Xbox content and services sales, with 61% attributable to the net impact of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nShares of Microsoft are up more than 10% year to date, behind rivals such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), which are up 15% and 22%, respectively. Over the last 12 months, Microsoft\u2019s shares have climbed 32%, though Amazon has jumped 67%, while Google is up 47%.\nThe three companies are battling it out to see which can offer the most comprehensive AI solutions to enterprise customers and customers, whether that means making heavy investments in third-party firms like OpenAI and Anthropic or reorganizing their internal teams like Google.\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI ambitions got a healthy boost on Tuesday when it announced that Coca-Cola (KO) signed a five-year, $1.1 billion agreement to use the software giant\u2019s Azure cloud services and AI technology.\n\u201cThrough our long-term partnership, we have made significant progress to accelerate system-wide AI transformation across The Coca-Cola Company and its network of independent bottlers worldwide,\u201d Microsoft executive vice president and chief commercial officer Judson Althoff said in a statement.\nMicrosoft has unleashed a torrent of new AI features and services for its enterprise and productivity apps and consumer platforms ever since it first debuted its revamped version of Bing and its AI chatbot in February 2023.\nIn March, Microsoft announced that it hired DeepMind AI and Inflection AI co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, fellow Inflection AI co-founder Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, as well as a number of the company\u2019s staff members. Suleyman is taking up a new post at Microsoft as CEO of the Microsoft AI division.\nIn February, Microsoft announced a multiyear partnership with French AI startup Mistral that would allow Microsoft to offer the company\u2019s models on its Azure platform.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) captivated Wall Street for several quarters now, with its stock up 41% over the last 12 months. While some of its peers\u00a0 suffered from macroeconomic headwinds, the Windows company reported solid growth and continued to beat analysts' expectations. Meanwhile, Microsoft rallied investors with an expanding position in artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn fact, Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3 trillion.\nPotent brands like Windows, Office, Xbox, LinkedIn, and Azure made Microsoft a tech behemoth. Its stock climbed 219% in the last five years alone, likely creating many millionaires along the way. However, the company could potentially beat that growth over the next half-decade as AI bolsters its cloud division, productivity software business, and even its personal computing segment.\nSo, here's why Microsoft could help you become a millionaire if you're willing to wait.\nShares in Microsoft jumped 5% in after-hours trading on April 25 after the company reported its earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2024, which ended March 31.\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations on multiple counts. Revenue rose 18% year over year to over $62 billion on expectations of just under $61 billion. Meanwhile, earnings per share reached $2.94 against forecasts of $2.82.\nMicrosoft benefited from impressive growth in multiple segments. The tech giant's productivity division reported a 13% year-over-year increase in revenue, while Intelligent Cloud sales climbed 20%.\nAdditionally, Microsoft's more personal computing segment posted a revenue boost of 19%, a promising sign that the industry is back on track after poor market conditions last year. The business includes income from the company's Xbox brand, which saw a 49% rise in gaming revenue. Microsoft attributed much of the growth to its recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the developer behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.\nThe glowing quarterly results could be an exciting glimpse into Microsoft's future, with growth catalysts across the tech industry.\nMicrosoft has a solid outlook, with leading positions in productivity software, computer operating systems, video games, and even social media. However, the company's biggest growth driver over the next decade will likely be AI and its cloud platform, Azure.\nMicrosoft's Intelligent Cloud segment produced nearly $27 billion in its most recent quarter. Seven percentage points of that growth were related to AI, up from 6 points the previous quarter. The company has a close partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, granting it exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI models.\nThe software giant used OpenAI's technology to bring AI features across its product lineup, including new generative tools in its Office productivity suite and new AI cloud services on Azure. OpenAI's models, combined with Microsoft's vast user base in the business world, appear to be paying off. Companies are increasingly adopting Azure's AI features to integrate the technology into their businesses, boosting Microsoft's earnings.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement, \"Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry.\"\nThe company's success has seen it steadily chip away at Amazon Web Services' (AWS) cloud market share. In the calendar fourth quarter of 2023, AWS' share fell by 2 points, while Azure's rose by 2 points.\nMicrosoft could be on a path to domination in AI software, and you won't want to miss out on its potential.\nMicrosoft's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is higher than many of its peers. The company's stock is trading at roughly 36 times its earnings, meaning its shares aren't exactly trading at a bargain.\nForward P/E is a helpful valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated earnings per share. The lower the figure, the better the value. In this case, Microsoft is a better value than its biggest rival, Amazon. Yet, it is less of a bargain than Apple, Alphabet, or Meta Platforms.\nHowever, I'd argue that Microsoft is worth its premium price tag and potentially a better buy than any of these companies. Microsoft is a better value than the top cloud provider, Amazon, while gradually gaining on its cloud market share.\nAdditionally, the Windows company hit over $67 billion in free cash flow last year, indicating it has the funds to continue expanding its business and keep outperforming its rivals.\nMicrosoft likely has a bright future as it continues to expand its role in AI and the cloud market. Meanwhile, its Xbox gaming division is enjoying swift growth thanks to its recent acquisition. The company has the potential to make you a millionaire with the right investment -- and as part of a diversified and well-balanced portfolio, of course. Microsoft stock is a no-brainer pick right now.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$475. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Microsoft analyst has a price target of US$600 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$400. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Microsoft'shistorical trends, as the 14% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 is roughly in line with the 13% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 13% per year. So although Microsoft is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry.\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

        "Text": "The race to develop infrastructure for powering generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications intensified following reports that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and OpenAI are expected to invest $100 billion to $115 billion in a new supercomputer called Stargate, according to tech-focused business publication The Information.\nWhile Microsoft and OpenAI themselves haven't released any details, the two companies are reportedly in the third phase of a five-phase project, of which Stargate is to be the fifth phase. The article suggests that a significant chunk of the budget for the project is likely to be spent on semiconductors, and the goal is for the supercomputer to go online in 2028.\nTo put things in perspective, Stargate could be 100 times more expensive than what it costs to build a massive data center right now, and the projected outlay on the project would be more than triple Microsoft's capital spending last year. There is a solid way for investors to capitalize on this potentially massive AI investment from Microsoft -- Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM).\nArm Holdings is a British chip designer that licenses its intellectual property to semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers, which then customize Arm's instruction sets to manufacture chips to their specifications and requirements. Its IP is used for manufacturing central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), neural processing units (NPUs), and interconnect technologies.\nAccording to Arm, more than 70% of the global population uses products based on its intellectual property. That's not surprising: Almost all the smartphones in the world run on Arm-based processors, while 50% of CPUs are made using its instruction sets. The company has two sources of revenue: licensing and royalties. It receives licensing fees from customers after selling its intellectual property to them. Customers also pay Arm royalties for every chip they ship that contains its technology.\nMicrosoft's new endeavor could be a tailwind for Arm's business. In November, Microsoft introduced its first in-house custom AI CPU, the Azure Cobalt. This custom CPU is based on the Arm Neoverse CSS platform. Arm says that Cobalt can \"tackle the biggest and most complex challenges the infrastructure will face from AI to sustainability.\"\nTech sector news site The Next Platform predicts that Microsoft will be looking to reduce its reliance on the likes of Nvidia by deploying future generations of the Cobalt processor for Stargate. That wouldn't be surprising, as custom AI processors not only save cloud companies money on capital costs and electricity expenses but also deliver better performance. Microsoft, for instance, said it witnessed jumps in performance of up to 40% after deploying the first generation of Cobalt chips.\nConsidering the huge amount of power that a supercomputer the size of Stargate would need, Microsoft is likely to pack a considerable amount of power-efficient custom chips such as Cobalt into it instead of power-hungry GPUs. As a result, Arm's AI-related revenue is likely to get a shot in the arm as Microsoft builds its ambitious supercomputer.\nThe good part is that Arm is already benefiting from the growing adoption of AI chips, but Microsoft's big project could provide yet another catalyst that leads to stronger top-line growth than analysts are anticipating.\nThe current consensus estimates are for Arm's earnings to increase at an annualized rate of nearly 45% for the next five years. If that proves accurate, its bottom line will jump to about $7.63 per share after five years (using its fiscal 2024 projected earnings of $1.19 per share as the base). If we multiply that projected earnings figure with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 27.3 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), we get a projected stock price for Arm of $208 in five years -- 69% above current levels.\nHowever, its earnings could be even stronger on the back of Stargate-driven demand from Microsoft, which is why investors looking to buy an AI stock would do well to buy Arm before it surges higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 73%",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Microsoft's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n44% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\n Recent sales by insiders \nIf you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that Microsoft does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Microsoft, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Microsoft is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Microsoft Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.1b worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. \nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Microsoft   you should know about.\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

        "Text": "On Thursday, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) issued its third quarter earnings report.\nYear to date, Microsoft shares are 10% up, behind its tech rivals,\u00a0Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) that are 15% and 22% up, respectively, with the three locked in a battle to show who can offer the most comprehensive AI solutions.\nThis week, Microsoft got a pleasant boost from the beverage giant, The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) who agreed to infuse Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0Azure cloud services and developing AI technology across its business and network.\nThird quarter results surpassed estimates.\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, revenue\u00a0rose 17% YoY to\u00a0$61.86\u00a0billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$60.80 billion.\nNet income\u00a0amounted to\u00a0$21.94 billion\u00a0or\u00a0$2.94 per share\u00a0and also surpassed LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$2.82 per share.\nOverall commercial cloud revenue came in at $35.1 billion, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s guidance for\u00a0$33.93 billion.\u00a0Intelligent Cloud segment\u00a0brought in\u00a0$26.71 billion\u00a0as sales rose about 21% with\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud\u00a0alone\u00a0growing 31%.\u00a0AI services contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue, rising from second quarter\u2019s 6 percentage points and first quarter\u2019s 3 percentage points.\nCapital expenditures jumped 79%\u00a0to\u00a0$14 billion.\u00a0Microsoft has been investing heavily\u00a0to secure Nvidia\u00a0Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)\u00a0graphics processing units\u00a0it needs to develop and train AI models.\u00a0But\u00a0even with all that investment, Microsoft has a shortage of data center infrastructure, specifically for deploying artificial intelligence models.\u00a0CFO Amy Hood\u00a0noted that\u00a0AI demand\u00a0could\u00a0outstrip available capacity\u00a0in the near-term. Microsoft is certainly not the only AI vendor with this\u00a0challenge as Nvidia is facing the same issue. Fueled by the AI boom, Nvidia reported its revenue more than tripled over consecutive quarters.\u00a0Microsoft, being one of its customers, is simply now feeling the stress Nvidia has been facing for a while due to insatiable AI demand. Only a month ago, Microsoft and Nvidia deepened their longstanding collaboration by announcing major integrations to accelerate the development of generative AI for enterprises.\nMore Personal Computing\u00a0revenue rose\u00a018%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$15.58, surpassing\u00a0StreetAccount consensus of $15.08 billion. \u00a0It was\u00a0driven by 11% growth in Windows OEM sales to PC manufacturers, along with 62% growth in sales of\u00a0Xbox content and services, with\u00a061%\u00a0being\u00a0attributable to the net impact of Microsoft's\u00a0October\u00a0acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nPC demand was slightly better than expected during the quarter and consequently,\u00a0sales of Windows licenses to device makers\u00a0rose\u00a011%.\nThe Productivity and Business Processes\u00a0unit that hosts Office software and LinkedIn, among others, reported a revenue rise of 12% as sales amounted to\u00a0$19.57 billion.\u00a0This is\u00a0first full quarter of\u00a0the Copilot-add-on\u00a0sales, on which Microsoft invested billions to develop.\nFourth quarter guidance was not as impressive.\nMicrosoft guided for\u00a0revenue\u00a0from\u00a0$63.5 billion\u00a0to\u00a0$64.5 billion\u00a0in the current quarter. Hood guided for a material rise in capital expenditures due to cloud infrastructure both in the current quarter and in the new fiscal year that will kick off on July 1st.\nThe boost from Coca Cola.\nThis week, Microsoft revealed it entered into a\u00a0five-year, $1.1 billion agreement\u00a0with Coca Cola.\u00a0The Coca-Cola Company\u00a0\u00a0will use Microsoft\u2019s tech expertise to\u00a0accelerate system-wide AI transformation across\u00a0its global business\u00a0and network of independent bottlers.\nAI is key to Microsoft\u2019s prospects, which means its\u00a0cloud business is running the show.\nGrowing faster than any other of its businesses, the Azure brings in\u00a0revenue of\u00a0tens of billions of dollars every quarter. Together with AI services that go within its package, Cloud is also Microsoft\u2019s biggest tool in its rivalry against Amazon and its Amazon Web Services.

Running the systems behind tools such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard has sent demand for cloud services and processing capacity soaring.

AI outfit Anthropic has attracted a $4 billion investment from Amazon and a $2 billion investment from Google, who also forged a 2021 partnership with AI firm Cohere.\nFor its part, Microsoft has also been actively on the lookout for more partnerships with burgeoning AI firms, earlier this year announcing a $16 million partnership with French tech firm Mistral AI.\nMicrosoft\u2019s $13 billion OpenAI investments piqued the interest of regulators \u2014 including, as well as the EU, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission \u2014 since a scandal embroiled the AI firm over the firing and subsequent rehiring of Sam Altman as chief of OpenAI late last year.\nMicrosoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella personally helped negotiate and advocate for his return to the company \u2014 at one point offering to hire Altman himself, along with other employees at OpenAI who wanted to leave.\nOpenAI\u2019s board eventually agreed to reinstate Altman and the company then named a three-person interim board and added Microsoft as a nonvoting observer.\nThat episode led regulators to examine the agreement. The UK watchdog said it would examine whether the balance of power between the two firms has fundamentally shifted to give one side more control or influence over the other, and the US Federal Trade Commission has made early-stage inquiries into the agreement.\nThe EU said it would look at Microsoft\u2019s investments as part of a broader examination into anticompetitive risks brought by Big Tech involvement in next-generation AI technologies.\n(Updates throughout)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets\nChina\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store\nRents Are the Fed\u2019s \u2018Biggest Stumbling Block\u2019 in Taming US Inflation\nThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance \n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

For the fiscal year that begins July 1, Microsoft projected growth of more than 10% in sales and operating income.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing healthy growth really across Azure, in the non-AI and AI services, which is important,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview. \u201cWhile of course it\u2019s still early in the long-term AI monetization opportunity, we feel good about where we are.\u201d The company is pleased with what it\u2019s seen so far in terms of customer adoption, she said.\nNadella told analysts on a conference call that Azure took market share from rivals, without specifying. More than 65% of Fortune 500 companies are using Azure OpenAI, the cloud service that lets customers access OpenAI\u2019s latest technology.\nCommercial cloud product revenue increased 23% to $35.1 billion, Microsoft said. Commercial bookings, a measure of future revenue, rose 29%, \u201cquite a bit ahead of where we expected,\u201d Hood said.\nMicrosoft\u2019s shares gained about 5% in late trading. They had closed at $399.04 in New York. The stock climbed 12% in the March quarter on optimism that the company\u2019s early lead in releasing generative AI products would boost sales.\nAI Assistants\nMicrosoft has leveraged its $13 billion investment in research pioneer OpenAI to create a series of AI assistants and other features. It\u2019s weaving those capabilities into products ranging from Windows to Office, security software to search engine Bing, many of which carry additional fees for customers to use.\nThe company is spending heavily to expand its global network of data centers to meet rising demand for AI services \u2014 with capital expenses reaching $14 billion during the quarter. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the AI demand continue to grow, and so we\u2019ll continue to work to match that,\u201d Hood said.\nOn the call with analysts, she forecast capital spending would increase \u201cmaterially\u201d from the $14 billion last quarter. Capital expenditures in the fiscal year starting July 1 will also be higher than the previous year, Hood said. Right now, initial demand for AI services is running slightly ahead of the data center capacity Microsoft has available to provide them, requiring an increase in data center outlay.\nOn Nov. 1, the software giant widely released the corporate version of Microsoft 365 Copilot \u2014 an AI assistant for Office programs like Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Teams \u2014 to large customers. The new tools cost companies an extra $30 a month on top of existing subscriptions, and could one day become a meaningful source of recurrent revenue. This year, Microsoft expanded access to smaller firms and debuted a $20 consumer version of the AI assistant. Nadella told analysts almost 60% of Fortune 500 customers are using the Copilot.\nMicrosoft is seeking to push AI outside the corporate market as well. Nadella last month hired Google DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to oversee the company\u2019s consumer AI operation, a move reflecting the CEO\u2019s dissatisfaction with the company\u2019s efforts to create and deploy AI products for home users, Bloomberg reported earlier.\nThe Redmond, Washington-based company is also baking AI into its fast-growing cybersecurity business. The company recently released tools that can generate summaries of suspicious incidents and ferret out methods hackers use to obscure their intentions. The cybersecurity operation, the world\u2019s largest, is showing \u201crelative strength,\u201d according to a Bank of America Securities note.\nSecurity Overhaul\nYet, earlier this month, the US Cyber Safety Review Board issued a scathing report documenting the company\u2019s inability to stop hackers from breaching the email boxes of US officials. The company has announced its biggest security overhaul in more than two decades, but it\u2019s unclear whether the effort will adequately address the challenges \u2014 or mollify critics.\nMicrosoft\u2019s desktop software business benefited from stabilizing demand for personal computers. Global PC sales returned to growth with a 1.5% gain in the quarter, according to market research firm IDC, driven by a recovery in most regions. Windows revenue rose 11% in the quarter, the company said.\nSales of Xbox content and services jumped 62%, thanks almost entirely to a revenue boost from the $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, completed last year. But Microsoft and rivals are still struggling to restore growth to the overall gaming industry, which is mired in a post-pandemic slump.\nIn an effort to rekindle sales, Microsoft is making four exclusive Xbox games available for Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch and Sony Group Corp.\u2019s PlayStation.\n(Updates with forecasts, AI demand beginning in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy\nTesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes\nBiden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts\nHow to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent\nHow the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Robust revenue growth with a 23% increase in Microsoft Cloud revenue.\nSignificant acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc. bolstering the gaming segment.\nContinued investment in AI and cloud infrastructure signaling future growth opportunities.\nChallenges include intense competition and the need to adapt to rapidly evolving technology and customer preferences.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nOn April 25, 2024, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) filed its 10-Q report, revealing a comprehensive view of its financial performance and strategic direction. The technology giant, known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite, reported a revenue of $61,856 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, up from $54,945 million in the same period last year. Net income also saw a significant increase to $21,931 million from $18,258 million. These figures underscore Microsoft's financial robustness and its ability to generate shareholder value amidst a dynamic market landscape.\nMarket Leadership and Diverse Portfolio: Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to demonstrate its market leadership through a diverse portfolio of products and services. The company's revenue streams are well-distributed across its three core segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. This diversification reduces reliance on any single product or service, providing stability and resilience against market fluctuations. For instance, the recent 23% increase in Microsoft Cloud revenue to $35.1 billion highlights the growing demand for cloud services and Microsoft's ability to capture this market segment effectively.\nStrong Financial Performance: Microsoft's financial health remains robust, with a strong balance sheet and impressive revenue growth. The company's net income and diluted earnings per share have both seen substantial increases in the reported quarter, indicating efficient operations and profitability. These financial metrics not only reflect Microsoft's current success but also provide the company with the capital necessary to invest in future growth opportunities, such as expanding its AI capabilities and cloud infrastructure.\nDependency on Third-Party Manufacturers: While Microsoft has a strong operational foundation, it relies heavily on third-party contract manufacturers for device production. This reliance poses a risk of supply chain disruptions, which could impact the company's ability to meet consumer demand, especially for products with components sourced from a limited number of qualified suppliers. The recent 17% decrease in Devices revenue could be indicative of such vulnerabilities in the manufacturing process.\nCompetitive Pressure on Operating Margins: Microsoft faces intense competition in the technology sector, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. As the company continues to invest in cloud and AI infrastructure, these operating costs are expected to increase, potentially decreasing operating margins. The competitive landscape requires Microsoft to innovate continuously, which can strain financial resources and affect profitability.\nExpansion in Cloud and AI Services: The growing demand for AI services presents Microsoft with significant opportunities to expand its datacenter locations and increase server capacity. The company's strategic investments in AI across its offerings position it to capitalize on this trend. For example, the 31% growth in Azure and other cloud services demonstrates Microsoft's potential to dominate this space and provide innovative solutions that meet evolving customer needs.\nStrategic Acquisitions: Microsoft's acquisition strategy, as evidenced by the purchase of Activision Blizzard, enhances its gaming segment and content offerings. This move not only diversifies Microsoft's revenue streams but also strengthens its position in the gaming industry, a sector with substantial growth prospects. The 62% increase in Xbox content and services revenue, driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, showcases the potential of strategic mergers and acquisitions to drive growth.\nRapid Technological and Market Evolution: The technology industry is characterized by rapid changes in technologies and business models. Microsoft must continuously adapt to remain competitive. The shift in customer preferences towards mobile devices and the cloud requires Microsoft to innovate and adjust its product offerings, which may lead to increased research and development costs and operational challenges.\nGeopolitical and Economic Uncertainties: Global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, such as currency fluctuations and market downturns, can significantly affect Microsoft's international operations and financial results. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions could disrupt sales, increase operating costs, or cause supply chain issues, thereby posing a threat to Microsoft's global business stability.\nIn conclusion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) exhibits a strong financial foundation and market leadership, bolstered by its diversified portfolio and strategic investments in cloud and AI services. However, the company must navigate challenges such as supply chain dependencies, competitive pressures, and the rapid evolution of technology and customer preferences. By leveraging its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats, Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain its status as a leading technology company in an ever-changing global landscape.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Foo Yun Chee ",
        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Microsoft will sell its chat and video app Teams separately from its Office product globally, the U.S. tech giant said on Monday, six months after it unbundled the two products in Europe in a bid to avert a possible EU antitrust fine.\nThe European Commission has been investigating Microsoft's tying of Office and Teams since a 2020 complaint by Salesforce-owned competing workspace messaging app Slack.\nTeams, which was added to Office 365 in 2017 for free, subsequently replaced Skype for Business and became popular during the pandemic due in part to its video conferencing.\nRivals, however, said packaging the products together gives Microsoft an unfair advantage. The company started selling the two products separately in the EU and Switzerland on Oct. 1 last year.\n\"To ensure clarity for our customers, we are extending the steps we took last year to unbundle Teams from M365 and O365 in the European Economic Area and Switzerland to customers globally,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\n\"Doing so also addresses feedback from the European Commission by providing multinational companies more flexibility when they want to standardise their purchasing across geographies.\"\nAfter the Justice Department sued Microsoft in 1998 for using its dominance of the Windows platform to stifle competition from rival web browsers, the company eventually made concessions that loosened its control of what software computer manufacturers could install on their products.\nRival internet browsers surged in popularity following that change, but Microsoft's separation of Teams from Office may not have as dramatic an effect, analysts said.\n\"Enterprise products are a different beast and Teams is so embedded into workflows that I don't think this has that same impact,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria.\nAfter Microsoft Teams was unbundled from the Microsoft 365 and Office Suites in Europe in Oct. 2023, the platform has seen the size of its user base remain mostly unchanged, according to Sensor Tower data.\nAccording to the market intelligence firm's estimates, Microsoft Teams' mobile app Monthly Active Users in the first quarter of 2024 remained relatively flat compared to fourth quarter of 2023, both at 19 million.\nMicrosoft said in a blogpost that it was introducing a new lineup of commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites that do not include Teams in regions outside the EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland, and also a new standalone Teams offering for Enterprise customers in those regions.\nStarting April 1, customers can either continue with their current licensing deal, renew, update or switch to the new offers.\nFor new commercial customers, prices for Office without Teams range from $7.75 to $54.75 depending on the product while Teams Standalone will cost $5.25. The figures may vary by country and currency. The company did not disclose prices for current packaged products.\nMicrosoft's unbundling may not be enough to stave off EU antitrust charges which will likely be sent to the company in the coming months as rivals criticise the level of the fees and the ability of their messaging services to function with Office Web Applications in their own services, sources said.\n\"This move may not completely ward off further regulatory scrutiny, but showing regulators Microsoft is willing to be proactive could still soften the stance by regulators,\" according to Gil Luria, a senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.\nMicrosoft, which has racked up 2.2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in EU antitrust fines in the past decade for tying or bundling two or more products together, risks a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if found guilty of antitrust breaches.\n($1 = 0.9265 euros)\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels and Zaheer Kachwala and Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Jason Neely and Krishna Chandra ELuri)\n"

        "Title": "Near an All-Time High, Is Microsoft Stock Still a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the clear winners of the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has been Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The stock generated impressive gains of 57% in 2023, tacking on an additional 12% so far this year (as of market close on Wednesday), and regularly breaches new all-time highs.\nThe company is best known for its ubiquitous Windows operating system, Office suite of productivity software, and Teams workplace collaboration platform. Most recently, however, Microsoft planted its flag in the area of generative AI, quickly integrating AI functionality into its roster of products and services.\nThis has investors in a quandary. After notching 75% gains in roughly 15 months, is Microsoft stock still a buy? Let's see what the data says.\nIt's easy to suggest that Microsoft was simply in the right place at the right time, but that would ignore the hard work going on behind the scenes. While generative AI first captured the spotlight early last year, Microsoft bet on the technology much earlier, investing $1 billion in AI start-up OpenAI back in 2019. Thus began a long-term partnership that helped take the technology to the next level.\nThe collaboration yielded a system that used supercomputers to train the large language models (LLMs) that underpin generative AI. The resulting bots could complete a variety of impressive tasks: generate frighteningly accurate images based on voice prompts, answer complicated questions, and complete the coding on an unfinished software app.\nMicrosoft decided to test the utility of this last bot within GitHub, a company it acquired in 2018. The platform, a place where developers worked together on software apps and shared code, was the perfect testing ground for such a tool. Despite its imperfections, developers flocked to the GitHub Copilot after its release in late 2021.\nThis success acted as a springboard for other Copilots that followed. In late 2022, Microsoft used a similar blueprint to train new versions of Copilot for each application in its Office Suite of workplace productivity tools. When Microsoft released a preview for public testing, Copilot contained \"guardrails\" or rules to limit incorrect responses. Furthermore, when Copilot responded to a query, it provided two responses, and testing partners were asked to choose the preferred response, further honing the tool's capabilities.\nThe results were so successful that Microsoft increased its stake in OpenAI to $13 billion by early 2023, accelerating the AI revolution that started with OpenAI's ChatGPT release.\nMicrosoft has since released a suite of industry- and job-specific Copilots, including those designed specifically for users in sales, service, and finance roles, with more on the drawing board.\nCEO Satya Nadella has reported getting rave reviews from Copilot users. \"Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it.\"\nIt's too early to tell just how much this foray into AI will be worth to Microsoft, but that hasn't stopped Wall Street's best and brightest from trying. The company charges users $30 per person per month for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Analysts from Piper Sandler estimate this could generate incremental revenue of $10 billion by 2026. Macquarie Research suggests that Copilot could generate $14 billion in revenue in its first full year alone -- and that's if just 10% of Microsoft's enterprise customers use the product. Analysts at Evercore are much more bullish, calculating that Copilot could add as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027.\nMicrosoft stock is currently selling for roughly 36 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500 index. While no one knows for sure just how much the company will reap from its Copilot strategy, the bump in revenue will likely be substantial.\nBe that as it may, the evidence suggests that Microsoft stock is still a reasonable buy, even near its all-time high.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At constant currency (cc), earnings increased 20% year over year.Revenues of $61.85 billion increased 17% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%. At cc, revenues grew 17% year over year.Commercial bookings increased 29% year over year and 31% at cc, which came ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length, as well as strong execution across the company\u2019s core annuity sales motions.Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% year over year (up 21% at cc) to $235 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenues in the next 12 months, up 20% year over year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 21%.Microsoft Cloud revenues were $35.1 billion, up 23% (up 23% at cc) year over year, driven by strong execution by sales teams and partners.In the consumer business, the personal computer (PC) market demand was slightly better than expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with expectations.In Gaming, Microsoft saw a better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. The company completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard on Oct 13, 2023.\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\nThe Productivity & Business Processes segment, which includes the Office and Dynamics CRM businesses, contributed 31.6% to total revenues.

Office 365 commercial revenues increased 15%, which came in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early progress in Copilot for Microsoft 365.The company surpassed one million Teams Rooms for the first time as it continues to make hybrid meetings better with new AI-powered features like automatic camera switching and speaker recognition. Teams Phone continues to be the market leader in cloud calling, now with more than 20 million PSTN users, up nearly 30% year over year. Such innovations are driving growth across Microsoft 365.Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year over year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was driven by small and medium business (SMB) and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB.Office commercial licensing declined 20% and 18% at cc, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.Office consumer revenues increased 4%, which was slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to 80.8 million.LinkedIn revenues rose 10% (up 9% at cc), which came ahead of expectations, driven by a better-than-expected performance in Premium Subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses.However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be negatively impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. New AI features are also helping accelerate LinkedIn Premium growth, with revenues increasing 29% year over year.Dynamics revenues jumped 19% (up 17% at cc), which was ahead of expectations, driven by Dynamics 365 that soared 23% (up 22% at cc) with continued rise across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, though bookings growth remains moderate.The Intelligent Cloud segment, including server and enterprise products and services, contributed 43.2% to total revenues. The segment reported revenues of $26.7 billion, which increased 21% year over year (up 21% at cc) and beat the consensus mark by 1.87%.Server products and cloud services revenues jumped 24% (up 24% at cc), driven by Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 31% (up 31% at cc), including roughly 7 points from AI services.In the non-AI portion of the consumption business, Microsoft saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments, as well as some benefit from a better-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition.In per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to more than 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in the new standalone business noted earlier.In on-premises server business, revenues rose 6%, which was ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.Enterprise and partner services revenues decreased 9% on a strong prior-year comparable for Enterprise Support Services.More Personal Computing segment, which primarily comprises Windows, Gaming, Devices and Search businesses, contributed 25.2% to total revenues. Revenues increased 17% year over year (up 17% at cc) to $15.6 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.36%. The growth included 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by a better-than-expected performance in Gaming and Windows OEM.Windows OEM revenues increased 11% year over year, which was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market, as well as a mix shift to higher monetizing markets.Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenues grew 13% (up 12% at cc), which was below expectations with growth trends in new standalone business, as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts.Devices revenues plunged 17% (down 16% at cc) as the company remained focused on higher margin premium products. Overall Surface demand was slightly lower than expected.Search and news advertising revenues ex-TAC climbed 12%, which was ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge.

Total Gaming revenues were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty.Xbox content and services revenues increased 62% (up 61% at cc), driven by 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenues declined 31% (down 30% at cc).At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, which was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative 4 cents impact on earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from the company\u2019s prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party, and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs.\nMicrosoft offers the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA and AMD, as well as the company\u2019s own first-party silicon.

With Copilot in Dynamics 365, Microsoft is helping businesses transform every role and business function. Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales are broadly available, helping customer service agents and sellers at companies like Land O\u2019Lakes, Northern Trust, Rockwell Automation and Toyota Group generate role-specific insights and recommendations from across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, as well as third-party platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow and Zendesk.Copilot for Finance is helping enterprises to reduce labor-intensive processes like collections and contract and invoice capture for companies like Dentsu and IDC. ISVs are also building their own Copilot integrations. For example, new integrations between Adobe Experience Cloud and Copilot will help marketers access campaign insights in the flow of their work.When it comes to devices, Copilot in Windows is now available on nearly 225 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, up 2X quarter over quarter.In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 200 healthcare organizations, including Providence, Stanford Health Care and WellSpan Health.\nGross profit increased 18% year over year to $43.3 billion.

The exchange shows how the company\u2019s top executives privately acknowledged they lacked the infrastructure and development speed to catch up to the likes of OpenAI and Google\u2019s DeepMind.\n\u201cWe are multiple years behind the competition in terms of machine learning scale.\u201dMicrosoft CTO Kevin Scott\nThe email was released late Tuesday after media organizations including the New York Times and Bloomberg intervened in the landmark antitrust suit to push for greater public access. The US Justice Department has argued that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and other innovations may have been released years ago if Google hadn\u2019t monopolized the search market.\nScott, who also serves as executive vice president of artificial intelligence at Microsoft, observed that Google\u2019s search product had improved on competitive metrics because of the Alphabet company\u2019s advancements in AI. The Microsoft executive wrote that he made a mistake by dismissing some of the earlier AI efforts of its competitors.\n\u201cWe are multiple years behind the competition in terms of machine learning scale,\u201d Scott said in the email.

Nadella has elevated the AI race to a priority at the company, also recruiting DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to run its consumer AI business.\nNadella answered questions about the email when he testified at the trial last fall.

And both sound pretty good.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) announced a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) in which the soft drink king would pay $1.1 billion to \u201cjointly experiment\u201d with Microsoft\u2019s new Azure AI-based version of its cloud-based suite of productivity software.\nAnd when Microsoft\u2019s quarterly results showed AI driving more and more of its cloud business growth and bullish guidance from an enthusiastic leadership team, the stock rose 2% Friday.\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) had a similar story, but with a stronger investor reaction \u2014 up 10% Friday \u2014 as investors reconsidered the company\u2019s second-place position to Microsoft. Now, it seems YouTube, search, and cloud businesses are strapped in and ready for their AI-ification.\nOn the other side of the table was Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) earnings presentation. The company doubled down on its endgame of fully autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi fleet, licensing self-driving tech to other automakers \u2014 they\u2019re in conversations, Elon Musk said \u2014 and the potential of harnessing the AI computing power of parked Teslas to create something akin to Amazon\u2019s AWS, a bold but old idea that has been floating around since the 1980s.\nThese are two very different visions of an AI future. \u201cProductivity software\u201d certainly doesn\u2019t have the same ring as \u201crobotaxi,\u201d which is on the fun end of Peter Thiel\u2019s \u201cwe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters\u201d spectrum we discussed two weeks ago.\nBut as our Chart of the Week shows, investors liked both of them.\nAnd they should. Tesla\u2019s surge was partially about rebutting some reasonable investor fears \u2014 cutting costs to tackle lagging demand and reaffirming that cheaper EVs are on the way. But the bigger story was the self-driving AI vision from the grand visionary.\nThis is rare, and it\u2019s why some people love Elon. For the most part, the path of AI first runs through the tedious corporate world of programmatic advertising and productivity tools, the core businesses of today\u2019s big AI software/cloud players \u2014 Google, Microsoft, and Meta.\nOn the other hand, Tesla\u2019s splashy self-driving future of consumer cars and robotaxis is far more aligned with the \u201cchange the world\u201d Big Tech expectation (aspiration, really) than the \u201cbetter Office 365\u201d reality we so often see.\nBut these more mundane improvements are everything. It\u2019s important to remember the lessons that any regional American city will teach you: Tons of America\u2019s rich simply took the practical route, embracing the less glamorous business of fast-food franchising, agricultural processing, waste management, car dealerships, commercial properties, not to mention all the other B2B things you\u2019d never think twice about. For every Zuckerberg, there are thousands of Buddy Garritys.\nZuckerberg, however, may have taken the mundane too far Wednesday in Meta\u2019s earnings call by, as our Hamza Shaban put it, making AI aspirations \u201cseem small.\u201d The company talked about \u201cscaling business messaging,\u201d \u201cbetter ad insertion,\u201d and selling AI computing power.\nAnd as we wrote in March, breaking productivity barriers is huge for the economy. But you still have to sell them. After all, they're still \"productivity gains,\" not flying cars.\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

The United States has also been concerned over deepening ties between China and the Gulf states, including the UAE.\nAmid U.S. concerns over its relationship with Chinese businesses, G42 had divested its investments in China and began the lengthy task of pulling out Chinese hardware, accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with U.S. companies, it said in February.\nMicrosoft and G42, in separate statements on Tuesday, described their assurances to the U.S. and UAE governments as a first of its kind agreement to ensure the secure, trusted and responsible development and deployment of AI. Microsoft said it was binding. The size of the stake Microsoft was taking was not disclosed.\nAbu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and American private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42, whose chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE National Security Advisor and a brother to the president.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith, who will take a seat on G42's board, said: \"We will combine world-class technology with world-leading standards for safe, trusted, and responsible AI, in close coordination with the governments of both the UAE and the United States.\"\nThe New York Times said the deal places a series of protections on the AI products shared with G42, including an agreement to strip Chinese gear out of the Emirati firm's operations. G42 will cease using Huawei telecom equipment, which the U.S. fears could provide a backdoor for Chinese intelligence agencies, the paper said.\nG42 and Microsoft said they would jointly bring advanced AI and digital infrastructure to countries in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa.\nThe two companies have collaborated multiple times over the last year, and G42 said it would use Microsoft's Azure data centres as part of its AI infrastructure to boost regional adoption.\nG42's Chief Executive Peng Xiao previously worked for company owned by Emirati cybersecurity firm DarkMatter, which hired former spies and was contracted by the UAE cyber security agency.\n\"Microsoft\u2019s investment in G42 marks a pivotal moment in our company's journey of growth and innovation, signifying a strategic alignment of vision and execution between the two organizations,\" Sheikh Tahnoon said in the G42 statement.\n(Reporting by Disha Mishra in Bengaluru and Alexander Cornwell in Dubai; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Mrigank Dhaniwala and Susan Fenton)\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft has spent billions on the data centers, chips, talent, and other infrastructure needed to build an artificial intelligence empire and it plans to spend billions more. So far, the strategy appears to be working. Following the company\u2019s quarterly earnings report on Thursday, investors sent the company's stock up 5.5% in after-hours trading and analysts applauded the numbers, with Wedbush\u2019s Daniel Ives in a Friday report calling Microsoft the \u201c#1 AI Draft Pick.\u201d But there\u2019s still something standing in the way of Microsoft\u2019s AI domination.\nWhen asked by an analyst during the Thursday earnings call about when revenue from AI projects will catch up to the billions Microsoft is spending on the technology, CEO Satya Nadella pointed to a needed culture change by business customers.\nImplementing AI tools like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot and Azure AI across a company often means upending how businesses have operated for years. \u201cAt the end of the day, companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cAnd so, that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology.\u201d\nDifficult but necessary culture change is afflicting even executives and employees within Microsoft. \u201cWe're also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process,\u201d he added.\nAnalysts consider Microsoft to be one of the best-positioned in AI due to its cloud computing business serving customers that use AI and its partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. But for the investment to pay off, Microsoft needs everyday workers to actually use its technology, which pits the company against human intransigence.\nWhile long-standing work habits are difficult to change, a promising sign for the adoption of AI technology is how workers learned to work from home during COVID, Microsoft 365 general manager Colette Stallbaumer told Fortune last year. The pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders required employees to quickly adopt new technologies, like Zoom video meetings, to do their jobs. As a result, people have become accustomed to change in the workplace, she said.\nTo help learn how to make its technology more attractive, Microsoft has researched how people form new work habits, she said. As of September, the company planned to appoint employees within its customers\u2019 businesses to be \u201cCopilot champions\u201d who can advocate for the use of Microsoft\u2019s virtual assistant, she said.\nThe last time Microsoft spearheaded a workplace change this big was in the 1990s, when personal computers took off, Nadella said during the earnings call. It will take time for business cultures and processes to shift, but it is also happening faster than ever. Workplaces are adopting Copilot \u201cfaster than any suite we have sold in the past,\u201d he said.\nFor the earnings report covering the first three months of 2024, all eyes were on the performance of Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platform Azure. Last quarter, Azure\u2019s business grew 30% year over year, of which six percentage points came directly from customer demand for AI products. Higher-than-expected growth continued this quarter. Azure sales grew 31% from the same time last year, with AI said to be responsible for seven of those percentage points.\nMicrosoft\u2019s company-wide revenue increased 17% from the same quarter last year to $61.9 billion. Profits rose 20% from the year-ago number, to $21.9 billion.\nThe stock was at $410 per share in mid-day trading on Friday, up 2.8% from Thursday\u2019s close and down slightly from after-hours trading on Thursday.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "On a red day for the stock market, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) investors, at least, were happy to hear that CFRA analyst Angelo Zino raised his price target on Microsoft stock to $475 per share.\nYou will no doubt be shocked to learn that the reason he raised his price target has something to do with artificial intelligence (AI).\nSpecifically, Zino argued that Microsoft's Azure cloud computing division -- already the company's biggest business by both revenues and profits, earning $37.9 billion on $87.9 billion in revenue last year -- grew a further 29% in Q1 2024. Zino says AI work contributed up to 8 percentage points of the growth.\nCombined with contributions from the now Microsoft-owned Activision, the analyst forecasts Microsoft will earn $11.74 per share this year ($0.10 ahead of consensus) and grow that between 14% and 15% in each of the next two years.\nThat's pretty brisk growth for a behemoth like Microsoft. And yet, despite raising his estimates and price target on Microsoft -- indeed, despite predicting the stock will rise 15% this year -- Zino nonetheless rates Microsoft stock a \"sell.\"\nWhy is that?\nIt's not entirely clear, but I can at least tell you why I am leery of Microsoft stock. Consider firstly that Microsoft's $82.5 billion in reported net income overstates the cash the company is generating ($67.4 billion in trailing free cash flow [FCF]) by 22%. In fact, it's been three years since Microsoft last generated FCF that matched its reported profits.\nValued on FCF, Microsoft stock trades for a 45x multiple. But Microsoft isn't growing anywhere near quickly enough to justify that valuation. As Zino says, the stock will average only 15% growth over the next few years (and that's faster than other analysts estimate).\nLong story short, Microsoft is a very profitable company and is growing quickly for its size. But its FCF is underwhelming and expected to continue to lag reported earnings for years. I'm more inclined to sell it than to buy it.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Increasingly, Only 10 Matter\nRevenue in the third quarter, which ended March 31, rose 17% to $61.9 billion, while profit was $2.94 a share, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts on average estimated per-share earnings of $2.83 on sales of $60.9 billion. The shares jumped in late trading.\nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been infusing Microsoft\u2019s entire product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI. The bet is starting to pay off, with some customers adding AI tools that summarize documents and generate content or signing up for Azure cloud subscriptions featuring OpenAI products.\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s generative AI-specific revenue has already become a key stock driver,\u201d said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co. \u201cMicrosoft appears to be in an excellent position to thrive.\u201d\nAzure revenue gained 31% in the quarter, above an average prediction of 29% and picking up slightly from the 30% growth in the previous period. About 7% of that increase was attributable to AI, compared with 6% in the prior quarter.\nThe company forecast Azure growth in the current period, ending June 30, of 30% to 31%, above the 29% expectation of analysts polled by Bloomberg. For the fiscal year that begins July 1, Microsoft projected growth of more than 10% in sales and operating income.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing healthy growth really across Azure, in the non-AI and AI services, which is important,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview. \u201cWhile of course it\u2019s still early in the long-term AI monetization opportunity, we feel good about where we are.\u201d The company is pleased with what it\u2019s seen so far in terms of customer adoption, she said.\nNadella told analysts on a conference call that Azure took market share from rivals, without specifying. More than 65% of Fortune 500 companies are using Azure OpenAI, the cloud service that lets customers access OpenAI\u2019s latest technology.\nCommercial cloud product revenue increased 23% to $35.1 billion, Microsoft said. Commercial bookings, a measure of future revenue, rose 29%, \u201cquite a bit ahead of where we expected,\u201d Hood said.\nMicrosoft\u2019s shares gained about 5% in late trading. They had closed at $399.04 in New York. The stock climbed 12% in the March quarter on optimism that the company\u2019s early lead in releasing generative AI products would boost sales.\nAI Assistants\nMicrosoft has leveraged its $13 billion investment in research pioneer OpenAI to create a series of AI assistants and other features. It\u2019s weaving those capabilities into products ranging from Windows to Office, security software to search engine Bing, many of which carry additional fees for customers to use.\nThe company is spending heavily to expand its global network of data centers to meet rising demand for AI services \u2014 with capital expenses reaching $14 billion during the quarter. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the AI demand continue to grow, and so we\u2019ll continue to work to match that,\u201d Hood said.\nOn the call with analysts, she forecast capital spending would increase \u201cmaterially\u201d from the $14 billion last quarter. Capital expenditures in the fiscal year starting July 1 will also be higher than the previous year, Hood said. Right now, initial demand for AI services is running slightly ahead of the data center capacity Microsoft has available to provide them, requiring an increase in data center outlay.\nOn Nov. 1, the software giant widely released the corporate version of Microsoft 365 Copilot \u2014 an AI assistant for Office programs like Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Teams \u2014 to large customers. The new tools cost companies an extra $30 a month on top of existing subscriptions, and could one day become a meaningful source of recurrent revenue. This year, Microsoft expanded access to smaller firms and debuted a $20 consumer version of the AI assistant. Nadella told analysts almost 60% of Fortune 500 customers are using the Copilot.\nMicrosoft is seeking to push AI outside the corporate market as well. Nadella last month hired Google DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to oversee the company\u2019s consumer AI operation, a move reflecting the CEO\u2019s dissatisfaction with the company\u2019s efforts to create and deploy AI products for home users, Bloomberg reported earlier.\nThe Redmond, Washington-based company is also baking AI into its fast-growing cybersecurity business. The company recently released tools that can generate summaries of suspicious incidents and ferret out methods hackers use to obscure their intentions. The cybersecurity operation, the world\u2019s largest, is showing \u201crelative strength,\u201d according to a Bank of America Securities note.\nSecurity Overhaul\nYet, earlier this month, the US Cyber Safety Review Board issued a scathing report documenting the company\u2019s inability to stop hackers from breaching the email boxes of US officials. The company has announced its biggest security overhaul in more than two decades, but it\u2019s unclear whether the effort will adequately address the challenges \u2014 or mollify critics.\nMicrosoft\u2019s desktop software business benefited from stabilizing demand for personal computers. Global PC sales returned to growth with a 1.5% gain in the quarter, according to market research firm IDC, driven by a recovery in most regions. Windows revenue rose 11% in the quarter, the company said.\nSales of Xbox content and services jumped 62%, thanks almost entirely to a revenue boost from the $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, completed last year. But Microsoft and rivals are still struggling to restore growth to the overall gaming industry, which is mired in a post-pandemic slump.\nIn an effort to rekindle sales, Microsoft is making four exclusive Xbox games available for Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch and Sony Group Corp.\u2019s PlayStation.\n(Updates with forecasts, AI demand beginning in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy\nTesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes\nBiden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts\nHow to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent\nHow the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. It was a record third quarter, powered by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $35 billion in revenue, up 23%. Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack, spanning everyday productivity, business process, and developer services, to models, data, and infrastructure, are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry. Now, I\u2019ll highlight examples, walking up the stack, starting with AI infrastructure. Azure again took share, as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA, AMD, as well as our own first-party silicon.\nOur AI innovation continues to build on our strategic partnership with OpenAI. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI Service. We also continue to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open source models, LLMs and SLMs. With Phi-3, which we announced earlier this week, we offer the most capable and cost-effective SLM available. It\u2019s already being trialed by companies like CallMiner, LTIMindtree, PwC, and TCS. Our Models as a Service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs and SLMs without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Hundreds of paid customers, from Accenture and EY, to Schneider Electric, are using it to take advantage of API access to third-party models, including as of this quarter the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral.\nAnd, as part of a partnership announced last week, G42 will run its AI applications and services on our cloud. All-up, the number of Azure AI customers continues to grow and average spend continues to increase. We also saw an acceleration of revenue from migrations to Azure. Azure Arc continues to help customers like DICK'S Sporting Goods and World Bank streamline their cloud migrations. Arc now has 33,000 customers, up over 2X year-over-year. And, we are the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premises Oracle estates to Azure, and Kyndryl and L'Oreal migrating their SAP workloads to Azure. Overall, we are seeing an acceleration in the number of large Azure deals from leaders across industries, including billion dollar plus multi-year commitments announced this month from Cloud Software Group and The Coca-Cola Company.\nThe number of $100 million plus Azure deals increased over 80% year-over-year, while the number of $10 million plus deals more than doubled. Now, on to data and analytics. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, governance, and AI. Over half of our Azure AI customers also use our data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure, PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB with deep integrations with Azure AI. TomTom is a great example. They\u2019ve used Cosmos DB along with Azure Open AI service to build their own immersive in-car infotainment system. We are also encouraged by our momentum with our next-generation analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric.\nFabric now has over 11,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from ABB, EDP, Energy Transfer to Equinor, Foot Locker, ITOCHU and Lumen, and we are seeing increased usage intensity. Fabric is seamlessly integrated with Azure AI Studio, meaning customers can run models against enterprise data that\u2019s consolidated in Fabric\u2019s multi-cloud data lake, OneLake. And Power BI, which is also natively integrated with Fabric provides business users with AI-powered insights. We now have over 350,000 paid customers. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is bending the productivity curve for developers. We now have 1.8 million paid subscribers with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter and continues to see increased adoption from businesses in every industry, including Itau, Lufthansa Systems, Nokia, Pinterest and Volvo cars.\nCoPilot is driving growth across the broader GitHub platform, too. AT&T, Citi Group and Honeywell all increased their overall GitHub usage after seeing productivity and code quality increases with CoPilot. All up more than 90% of the Fortune 100 are now GitHub customers and revenue accelerated over 45% year-over-year. Anyone can be a developer with new AI-powered features across our low-code, no-code tools, which makes it easier to build an app, automate workflow or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations, across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. Cineplex, for example, built a Copilot for customer service agents, reducing query handling time from as much as 15 minutes to 30 seconds.\nAll up over 330,000 organizations, including over half of Fortune 100 have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, and Power Apps now has over 25 million monthly active users, up over 40% year-over-year. Now on to future of work, we are seeing AI democratize expertise across the workforce. What inventory turns are to efficiency of supply chains, knowledge turns, the creation and diffusion and knowledge are to productivity of an organization. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 is helping increase knowledge turns, thus having a cascading effect changing work, work artifacts and workflows and driving better decision-making, collaboration and efficiency. This quarter, we made Copilot available to organizations of all types and sizes from enterprises to small businesses, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot and we have seen accelerated adoption across industries and geographies with companies like Amgen, BP, Cognizant, Koch Industries, Moody\u2019s, Novo Nordisk, NVIDIA, and Tech Mahindra purchasing over 10,000 seats.\nWe\u2019re also seeing increased usage intensity from early adopters, including a nearly 50% increase in the number of Copilot-assisted interactions per user in Teams, bridging group activity with business process workflows and enterprise knowledge. And we\u2019re not stopping there. We\u2019re accelerating our innovation, adding over 150 Copilot capabilities since the start of the year. With Copilot and Dynamics 365, we are helping businesses transform every role in business function as we take share with our AI-powered apps across all categories. This quarter, we made our Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales broadly available, helping customer service agents and sellers at companies like Land O\u2019Lakes, Northern Trust, Rockwell Automation and Toyota Group generate role-specific insights and recommendations from across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, as well as third-party platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk.\nAnd with our Copilot for Finance, we are drawing context from dynamics, as well as ERP systems like SAP to reduce labor-intensive processes like collections and contract and invoice capture for companies like Dentsu and IDC. ISVs are also building their own co-pilot integrations. For example, new integrations between Adobe Experience Cloud and Copilot will help marketeers access campaign insights in the flow of their work. When it comes to devices, Copilot in Windows is now available on nearly 225 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, up 2x quarter-over-quarter. With Copilot, we have an opportunity to create an entirely new category of devices, purpose-built for this new generation of AI. All of our largest OEM partners have announced AI PCs in recent months.\nAnd this quarter, we introduced new surface devices, which includes integrated NPUs to power on-device AI experiences like auto framing and live captions. And there is much more to come in just a few weeks, we\u2019ll hold a special event to talk about our AI vision across Windows and devices. When it comes to Teams, we once again saw year-over-year usage growth. We\u2019re rolling out a new version, which is up to two times faster while using 50% less memory to all customers. We surpassed 1 million Teams Rooms for the first time as we continue to make hybrid meetings better with new AI-powered features like automatic camera switching and speaker recognition. And Teams Phone continues to be the market leader in cloud calling now with over 20 million PSTN users, up nearly 30% year-over-year.\nAll of this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365 companies across the private and public sector, including Amadeus, BlackRock, Chevron, Ecolab, Kimberly-Clark. All chose our premium E5 offerings this quarter for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. We are also bringing AI-powered transformation to every industry. In health care, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 200 health care organizations, including Providence, Stanford Health Care and WellSpan Health. And in manufacturing, this week at Hannover Messe, customers like BMW, Siemens and Volvo Penta shared how they're using our cloud and AI solutions to transform factory operations. Now on to security. Security underpins every layer of the tech stack, and it's our number one priority.\nWe launched our Secure Future Initiative last fall for this reason, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection, and we are doubling down on this very important work, putting security above all else, before all other features and investments. We are focused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of this initiative as we protect tenants and isolate production systems, protect identities and secrets, protect networks, protect engineering systems, monitor and detect threats, and accelerate responses and remediation. We remain committed to sharing our learnings, tools and innovation with customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available earlier this month, bringing together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights.\nNow let me talk about our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. We continue to combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way members learn, sell and get hired. Features like LinkedIn AI-assisted messages are seeing a 40% higher acceptance rate and accepted over 10% faster by job seekers, saving hirers time and making it easier to connect them to candidates. Our AI-powered collaborative articles, which has reached over 12 million contributions are helping increase engagement on the platform, which reached a new record this quarter. New AI features are also helping accelerate LinkedIn Premium growth with revenue up 29% year-over-year. And we are also seeing strength across our other businesses with hiring taking share for the seventh consecutive quarter.\nNow on to search, advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketeers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines and descriptions. Now on to gaming. We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices. We set third quarter records for game streaming hours, console usage and monthly active devices.\nAnd last month, we added our first Activision Blizzard title Diablo IV to our Game Pass service. Subscribers played over 10 million hours within the first 10 days, making it one of our biggest first-party Game Pass launches ever. We were also encouraged by ongoing success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which is attracting new gamers and retaining franchise loyalists. Finally, we are expanding our games to new platforms, bringing four of our fan favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time. In fact, earlier this month, we had seven games among the top 25 on the PlayStation store more than any other publisher. In closing, I'm energized about our opportunity ahead as we innovate to help people and businesses thrive in this new era.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%; and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%. Results exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. In Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite.\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 20% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations. In gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share.\nA reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline.\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\nOffice Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year.\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition.\nIn our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\nOperating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts.\nDevices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products. Overall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge. And in gaming. Revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in constant currency with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\nGross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 41% with 43 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion. Cash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. When compared to our January guide for Q4, FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution.\nAs a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases.\nWe continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. We continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\nTherefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. This operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility.\nWe expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now I\u2019d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore, significant growth opportunities for years to come. In FY2025, that focus on execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth to scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY2025 capital expenditures to be higher than FY2024. These expenditures over the course of the next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services. So we will manage that signal through the year. We will also continue to prioritize operating leverage.\nAnd therefore, we expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI investments, as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our global customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year. With that, let\u2019s go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question.

        "Title": "Near an All-Time High, Is Microsoft Stock Still a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the clear winners of the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has been Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The stock generated impressive gains of 57% in 2023, tacking on an additional 12% so far this year (as of market close on Wednesday), and regularly breaches new all-time highs.\nThe company is best known for its ubiquitous Windows operating system, Office suite of productivity software, and Teams workplace collaboration platform. Most recently, however, Microsoft planted its flag in the area of generative AI, quickly integrating AI functionality into its roster of products and services.\nThis has investors in a quandary. After notching 75% gains in roughly 15 months, is Microsoft stock still a buy? Let's see what the data says.\nIt's easy to suggest that Microsoft was simply in the right place at the right time, but that would ignore the hard work going on behind the scenes. While generative AI first captured the spotlight early last year, Microsoft bet on the technology much earlier, investing $1 billion in AI start-up OpenAI back in 2019. Thus began a long-term partnership that helped take the technology to the next level.\nThe collaboration yielded a system that used supercomputers to train the large language models (LLMs) that underpin generative AI. The resulting bots could complete a variety of impressive tasks: generate frighteningly accurate images based on voice prompts, answer complicated questions, and complete the coding on an unfinished software app.\nMicrosoft decided to test the utility of this last bot within GitHub, a company it acquired in 2018. The platform, a place where developers worked together on software apps and shared code, was the perfect testing ground for such a tool. Despite its imperfections, developers flocked to the GitHub Copilot after its release in late 2021.\nThis success acted as a springboard for other Copilots that followed. In late 2022, Microsoft used a similar blueprint to train new versions of Copilot for each application in its Office Suite of workplace productivity tools. When Microsoft released a preview for public testing, Copilot contained \"guardrails\" or rules to limit incorrect responses. Furthermore, when Copilot responded to a query, it provided two responses, and testing partners were asked to choose the preferred response, further honing the tool's capabilities.\nThe results were so successful that Microsoft increased its stake in OpenAI to $13 billion by early 2023, accelerating the AI revolution that started with OpenAI's ChatGPT release.\nMicrosoft has since released a suite of industry- and job-specific Copilots, including those designed specifically for users in sales, service, and finance roles, with more on the drawing board.\nCEO Satya Nadella has reported getting rave reviews from Copilot users. \"Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it.\"\nIt's too early to tell just how much this foray into AI will be worth to Microsoft, but that hasn't stopped Wall Street's best and brightest from trying. The company charges users $30 per person per month for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Analysts from Piper Sandler estimate this could generate incremental revenue of $10 billion by 2026. Macquarie Research suggests that Copilot could generate $14 billion in revenue in its first full year alone -- and that's if just 10% of Microsoft's enterprise customers use the product. Analysts at Evercore are much more bullish, calculating that Copilot could add as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027.\nMicrosoft stock is currently selling for roughly 36 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500 index. While no one knows for sure just how much the company will reap from its Copilot strategy, the bump in revenue will likely be substantial.\nBe that as it may, the evidence suggests that Microsoft stock is still a reasonable buy, even near its all-time high.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That service uses technology from Microsoft-backed startup and ChatGPT creator OpenAI to let customers build chatbots and other AI services that run in Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.\nCoca-Cola had in 2020 signed a five-year deal worth $250 million to use Microsoft's cloud and business software.\nThe two companies said Coca-Cola would test Microsoft's Copilot offerings to see how the tools improve productivity for the beverage maker. Copilot is an AI assistant that can help summarize lengthy email discussions and build slide decks for business presentations, among its many functions.\nThe deal announced Wednesday also includes Coca-Cola expanding its use of other, conventional Microsoft software such as Dynamics 365, which is used by sales professionals and competes against Salesforce.\nMicrosoft did not specify the financial breakdown of the $1.1 billion Coca-Cola deal in terms of the dollar amount attributable to AI services versus traditional cloud software.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n"

        "Title": "Tesla and Microsoft presented 2 distinct versions of AI. Investors liked both.",
        "Author": " Ethan Wolff-Mann    \u00b7 Senior Editor",
        "Text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nInvestors were treated to two different versions of artificial intelligence this week. And both sound pretty good.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) announced a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) in which the soft drink king would pay $1.1 billion to \u201cjointly experiment\u201d with Microsoft\u2019s new Azure AI-based version of its cloud-based suite of productivity software.\nAnd when Microsoft\u2019s quarterly results showed AI driving more and more of its cloud business growth and bullish guidance from an enthusiastic leadership team, the stock rose 2% Friday.\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) had a similar story, but with a stronger investor reaction \u2014 up 10% Friday \u2014 as investors reconsidered the company\u2019s second-place position to Microsoft. Now, it seems YouTube, search, and cloud businesses are strapped in and ready for their AI-ification.\nOn the other side of the table was Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) earnings presentation. The company doubled down on its endgame of fully autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi fleet, licensing self-driving tech to other automakers \u2014 they\u2019re in conversations, Elon Musk said \u2014 and the potential of harnessing the AI computing power of parked Teslas to create something akin to Amazon\u2019s AWS, a bold but old idea that has been floating around since the 1980s.\nThese are two very different visions of an AI future. \u201cProductivity software\u201d certainly doesn\u2019t have the same ring as \u201crobotaxi,\u201d which is on the fun end of Peter Thiel\u2019s \u201cwe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters\u201d spectrum we discussed two weeks ago.\nBut as our Chart of the Week shows, investors liked both of them.\nAnd they should. Tesla\u2019s surge was partially about rebutting some reasonable investor fears \u2014 cutting costs to tackle lagging demand and reaffirming that cheaper EVs are on the way. But the bigger story was the self-driving AI vision from the grand visionary.\nThis is rare, and it\u2019s why some people love Elon. For the most part, the path of AI first runs through the tedious corporate world of programmatic advertising and productivity tools, the core businesses of today\u2019s big AI software/cloud players \u2014 Google, Microsoft, and Meta.\nOn the other hand, Tesla\u2019s splashy self-driving future of consumer cars and robotaxis is far more aligned with the \u201cchange the world\u201d Big Tech expectation (aspiration, really) than the \u201cbetter Office 365\u201d reality we so often see.\nBut these more mundane improvements are everything. It\u2019s important to remember the lessons that any regional American city will teach you: Tons of America\u2019s rich simply took the practical route, embracing the less glamorous business of fast-food franchising, agricultural processing, waste management, car dealerships, commercial properties, not to mention all the other B2B things you\u2019d never think twice about. For every Zuckerberg, there are thousands of Buddy Garritys.\nZuckerberg, however, may have taken the mundane too far Wednesday in Meta\u2019s earnings call by, as our Hamza Shaban put it, making AI aspirations \u201cseem small.\u201d The company talked about \u201cscaling business messaging,\u201d \u201cbetter ad insertion,\u201d and selling AI computing power.\nAnd as we wrote in March, breaking productivity barriers is huge for the economy. But you still have to sell them. After all, they're still \"productivity gains,\" not flying cars.\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

However, current qubits are susceptible to errors, limiting their practicality. Microsoft's approach involves improving the quality of physical qubits and employing advanced techniques to create more reliable virtual qubits, known as logical qubits.Microsoft's achievement stems from coupling its qubit-virtualization system with Quantinuum\u2019s specialized hardware. The team successfully performed multiple active syndrome extractions without destroying the logical qubits. This crucial capability allows for longer and more complex computations without failure, marking a fundamental milestone in quantum error correction.By combining Microsoft's system with Quantinuum\u2019s H-Series ion-trap qubits and unique Quantum Charged Coupled Device architecture, the team claims to have achieved a remarkable two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.8%.

        "Title": "Better AI Buy: Microsoft vs. Alphabet Stock",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman and Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After the launch of ChatGPT, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) emerged as top rivals, and that battle has persisted. Microsoft has aligned itself with ChatGPT parent OpenAI, while Alphabet has sought to challenge its leadership with products like Bard and later Gemini. So which artificial intelligence (AI) stock is the better buy?\nJeremy Bowman (Microsoft): The question of whether to build or buy is a common one in technology, and in generative AI, Microsoft and Alphabet have largely gone in different directions in this regard.\nMicrosoft has tied its fortunes to OpenAI, the ChatGPT parent, through a reported $13 billion investment, and that has enabled Microsoft to essentially use OpenAI's technology as its own. As a result, the tech giant has been able to implement OpenAI's technology in products like its Azure cloud infrastructure services, GitHub code repository, Office productivity suite, and Bing search engine.\nThose moves are already having an impact as Microsoft said that AI added 6 percentage points to Azure's growth in the most recent quarter.\nMicrosoft's diversification also acts as a competitive advantage here. Unlike Alphabet, which makes a majority of its revenue from search advertising, Microsoft has a wide array of products that span enterprise software, video games, cloud computing, social media, and more, and that gives it more opportunities to leverage the power of AI.\nMicrosoft has also been more aggressive in AI than Alphabet has. CEO Satya Nadella has apparently been planning for this moment for years, as Microsoft first invested in back in 2019.\nAlphabet has also been investing in AI for several years, but the company has been more hesitant to release new products, and when it has it hasn't always gone well. The initial presentation for Bard was sloppy and widely panned, and Gemini has been criticized for historical inaccuracies.\nMicrosoft shows no intention of slowing down in AI; it just hired Deepmind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who also co-founded the recently shuttered Inflection AI. Microsoft stock may be expensive, but it deserves to trade at a premium. It will be hard to catch the AI leader.\nAnders Bylund (Alphabet): I have nothing but respect for Microsoft, but Redmond's finest can't measure up to Alphabet's ultimate long-term planning.\nAlphabet's visionary approach and unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation make it a compelling choice for investors seeking long-term growth. The company's core business -- online search and advertising under the Google banner -- dominates the search engine market. However, Alphabet's ambitions extend far beyond search, with the company consistently investing in cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to reshape entire industries.\nOne such area is artificial intelligence, where Alphabet's research and development efforts have produced groundbreaking advancements. From natural language processing to computer vision, Alphabet's AI technologies are being applied in diverse fields, from healthcare research to self-driving vehicles.\nMoreover, Alphabet's commitment to moonshot projects through its X division showcases its willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of revolutionary innovations. Projects like Intrinsic, Alphabet's industrial robotics project, and Loon, which aims to provide internet access to remote areas via high-altitude balloons, exemplify the company's audacious vision and long-term thinking.\nLong story short, Alphabet is ready to roll with the punches as the tech market evolves. Furthermore, the stock is much more affordable than Microsoft, whose stock has soared on the wings of its deep OpenAI partnership. You can pick up Alphabet shares at the reasonable price of 6 times sales or 27 times free cash flow today. Double those numbers to get an estimate of Microsoft's ratios.\nIn my view, Microsoft's stock looks overdue for a correction while Alphabet is getting ready to run higher. That's an easy choice.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Kevin Vandenboss ",
        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nIf you\u2019re looking to generate steady passive income from your investments, dividend stocks like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) might seem like an obvious choice. After all, the tech giant has been a reliable dividend payer for years, consistently increasing its quarterly payout. But before you start loading up on Microsoft shares, let\u2019s crunch the numbers.\nTo earn $100 per month in dividends from Microsoft, you\u2019d need to own a staggering 400 shares at the current quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. With Microsoft trading around $409 as of this writing, that would require an eye-watering investment of $163,600.\nSure, you\u2019d be generating a cool $1,200 per year in dividend income. But that only translates to a paltry 0.73% yield on your investment. Suddenly, the passive income dream starts to look a bit less dreamy.\nWhat if I told you there was a way to earn significantly higher yields without having to tie up hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single stock? Enter Arrived Homes, the real estate investing platform that lets you buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100.\nOn Arrived, the average annualized dividend yield across all offerings is an enticing 4.2%\u2014that\u2019s over five times higher than Microsoft\u2019s current yield. And unlike Microsoft, which pays dividends quarterly, Arrived investors get paid every single month.\nLet\u2019s do the math: To generate $100 per month in passive income at a 4.2% yield, you\u2019d need to invest just $28,571. That\u2019s a fraction of the $163,600 you\u2019d have to sink into Microsoft shares to achieve the same income stream.\nBut here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 you don\u2019t need to come up with that full $28,571 all at once. With Arrived, you can get started with just $100 and build your portfolio over time by investing in $10 shares of individual rental properties. That means you can start generating meaningful passive income right away and scale up at your own pace. To help you grow your portfolio even faster, those monthly dividends can be reinvested right back into more properties if you choose.\nOf course, no investment is without risk. But by diversifying across multiple properties \u2013 each carefully vetted by the platform\u2019s team of real estate experts \u2013 you can potentially mitigate some of the risks associated with owning physical real estate directly.\nThe bottom line? While Microsoft may be a rock-solid company, its dividend alone is unlikely to fund your financial freedom anytime soon. For investors seeking higher yields and the ability to start small, Arrived\u2019s rental property shares offer a compelling alternative.\nSo why settle for a measly 0.73% yield when there are reliable higher yield options available? Click here to explore current offerings and start building your passive income portfolio today.\nThis article How Many Microsoft Shares Do You Need To Earn $100 Per Month In Dividends?

        "Text": "Microsoft MSFT has announced that beloved video game franchises from Blizzard Entertainment that captured the hearts of millions in China will soon be making a comeback under a new publishing agreement with NetEase NTES.After a year of discussions, Blizzard Entertainment and Chinese Internet giant NetEase revealed that they have reached a deal to once again bring hugely popular titles like World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and games from the Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo and StarCraft universes back to players in mainland China.The renewed partnership builds on more than 15 years of previous collaboration between the two companies. NetEase was the publisher of Blizzard games in China from 2008 to 2023.A number of Blizzard games were taken offline in China in January 2023 after the developer terminated the partnership with NetEase citing disagreement over intellectual property control. The pair subsequently sued each other. Tension eased after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard in October, which was followed by changes in management.While the timing and further details are still to be announced, the renewed agreement will allow Chinese players to regain access to games they previously enjoyed under the prior deal before it lapsed.Separately, Microsoft Gaming and NTES also announced an agreement to explore bringing new NetEase titles to Xbox consoles and other platforms as part of MSFT's commitment to bringing more games to more players around the world.\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\nMicrosoft recently revealed the formation of a new team working on preserving Xbox's current library of games for future hardware, highlighting its importance to both Xbox and the gaming industry.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 12.9% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 11.4%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Microsoft teased its plans for next-generation Xbox hardware back in February, claiming that it was focused on delivering the largest technical leap for a new console generation with the next Xbox.Game preservation has become an increasingly pressing issue in recent years due to the prevalence of online requirements and digital formats. Many modern games, particularly live service titles, are unplayable without an Internet connection and risk disappearing permanently when servers are shut down.MSFT's commitment to game preservation aligns with its strong track record of backward compatibility. The Xbox 360 backward compatibility program, which allows players to enjoy hundreds of popular Xbox 360 games on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles, remains one of the platform's most beloved features.Microsoft's identity as a platform owner has come under the strain of late as Xbox Series S/X console sales lag far behind Sony's SONY PS5 and Nintendo NTDOY Switch.Its decision to release some Xbox exclusive titles on PS5 and Nintendo Switch and a sore lack of triple-A exclusives on its own platform has left the company in a perceivably weakened position in the console market.Microsoft, however, boasts a strong portfolio of game studios, especially since its successful acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year in a $69 billion deal that set a record for takeovers in the video game industry. The combined entity ranks No. 3 among global games publishers, behind Tencent Holdings and Sony.The launch of Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass has quickly made Xbox the game's most popular platform. Additionally, MSFT is preparing for the upcoming releases of highly anticipated titles, such as Hellblade II, Avowed and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which are likely to bring much needed wind in Xbox's sails.While Microsoft has not revealed a launch window for the next generation of Xbox consoles, court documents from the FTC trial in June last year revealed that the company expects the next-generation Xbox and PS6 to launch in 2028.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft MSFT and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on an ambitious venture, as reported by The Information, to establish a cutting-edge data center project estimated at a staggering $100 billion. Central to this initiative is the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer named Stargate, which is anticipated to debut in 2028.The proposed endeavor underscores the surging demand for AI data centers capable of managing complex tasks beyond the scope of conventional data centers. With the rapid adoption of generative AI technology, there is an imperative need for advanced infrastructure.The envisioned supercomputer, to be situated in the United States, represents the pinnacle of a series of supercomputers slated for construction over the next six years.

The high cost of building the supercomputer is being attributed to bottlenecks in the supply of high-performance GPUs used for the development of AI models.

Moreover, the project is designed to accommodate chips from various suppliers, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in its operations.Currently, Nvidia is one of the largest suppliers of high-end chips and is struggling to keep up with ever-increasing demand. The company\u2019s latest AI chip called Blackwell B200 will cost anywhere between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit. Notably, the platform features GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive and multi-trillion-parameter language models.Advanced Micro Devices AMD has entered into the conversation of new accelerators and processors for AI with its MI300 series chips. AMD\u2019s MI300X chips helped the company take market share by battling Nvidia\u2019s popular H100 series chips that have been used to train large language models like OpenAI\u2019s chat GPT. Intel Corporation INTC unveiled the Intel Core Ultra featuring the neural processing unit, which enables power-efficient AI acceleration with 2.5x better power efficiency than the previous generation.Last month, Microsoft introduced two new devices, namely the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6. These AI-powered PCs cater specifically to business needs, featuring Copilot integration and advanced hardware specifications, such as Intel Core Ultra processors and Neural Processing Units for AI experiences.Microsoft has also agreed to pay $650 million in order to license Inflection AI\u2019s artificial intelligence software, alongside the company\u2019s recent move to hire the startup\u2019s co-founders, Mustafa Suleyman and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan. MSFT will also hire Inflection AI\u2019s 70 employees. As part of the deal, the company will pay $620 million to license Inflection\u2019s AI models and around $30 million for waiving any legal rights related to the mass hiring.Shares of the company have gained 11.9% compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 11.4% year to date.

That service uses technology from Microsoft-backed startup and ChatGPT creator OpenAI to let customers build chatbots and other AI services that run in Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.\nCoca-Cola had in 2020 signed a five-year deal worth $250 million to use Microsoft's cloud and business software.\nThe two companies said Coca-Cola would test Microsoft's Copilot offerings to see how the tools improve productivity for the beverage maker. Copilot is an AI assistant that can help summarize lengthy email discussions and build slide decks for business presentations, among its many functions.\nThe deal announced Wednesday also includes Coca-Cola expanding its use of other, conventional Microsoft software such as Dynamics 365, which is used by sales professionals and competes against Salesforce.\nMicrosoft did not specify the financial breakdown of the $1.1 billion Coca-Cola deal in terms of the dollar amount attributable to AI services versus traditional cloud software.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft\u2019s MSFT third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, scheduled to be reported on Apr 25, are likely to be driven by the consistent growth in its cloud platform, Azure.For the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft expects Intelligent Cloud revenues (Azure falls under the segment) between $26 billion and $26.3 billion.Our model estimate for Intelligent Cloud revenues is currently pegged at $26.01 billion, indicating 17.8% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMicrosoft Corporation price-eps-surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote\nMicrosoft is witnessing robust demand for its cloud infrastructure monitoring, web-based application performance management and human capital management solutions. This demand is fueled by the increasing migration of workloads to the cloud.During the fiscal second quarter, Azure and other cloud services revenues grew 30% (up 28% at cc), including roughly 6 points from AI services, which was higher than the previous quarter's 29% (28% at cc). In Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth at cc to remain stable in the fiscal third quarter, with increasing contributions from all Azure AI services. Additionally, the company's per-user business is expected to have benefited from the momentum in the Microsoft 365 suite.In the to-be-reported quarter, MSFT announced the expansion of its collaboration with Oracle ORCL to meet growing customer demand for Oracle Database@Azure with five more regions, which brings the total planned multi-cloud availability footprint to 15 regions globally.Azure's increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally is expected to have strengthened the tech giant's competitive position in the cloud computing market, dominated by Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud division, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud.In the last reported quarter, AWS revenues (14% of sales) rose 13% year over year to $24.2 billion, with operating income of $7.2 billion, up 37.7% year over year. The expansion of AWS' portfolio has been helping Amazon maintain its dominance in the cloud domain by gaining more customers.Alphabet's Google Cloud revenues rose 25.7% year over year to $9.19 billion, accounting for 10.6% of the quarter\u2019s total revenues. Google Cloud reported operating income of $864 million against a loss of $186 million in the year-ago quarter.\nMicrosoft has tightly integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 language model into its Bing search engine and Edge browser, delivering a ChatGPT-like experience to users. The Azure OpenAI Service enables developers to easily incorporate large language models and generative AI into applications across various use cases.In the fiscal second quarter, MSFT witnessed solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers. More than one-third of customers are new to Azure over the past 12 months.The company has launched copilot templates that allow retailers to build personalized shopping experiences and streamline store operations using generative AI. Microsoft and OpenAI are collaborating on an advanced data center project to meet the immense computational demands of complex generative AI tasks.Despite these cutting-edge AI moves, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 10% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s 11.1% growth amid intensifying competition from Amazon and Alphabet as they are all making aggressive moves to expand their generative AI capabilities.You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.AWS is leveraging AMZN\u2019s Bedrock, which provides access to high-performance foundation models from AI firms through an API.

        "Text": "Microsoft MSFT has announced that beloved video game franchises from Blizzard Entertainment that captured the hearts of millions in China will soon be making a comeback under a new publishing agreement with NetEase NTES.After a year of discussions, Blizzard Entertainment and Chinese Internet giant NetEase revealed that they have reached a deal to once again bring hugely popular titles like World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and games from the Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo and StarCraft universes back to players in mainland China.The renewed partnership builds on more than 15 years of previous collaboration between the two companies. NetEase was the publisher of Blizzard games in China from 2008 to 2023.A number of Blizzard games were taken offline in China in January 2023 after the developer terminated the partnership with NetEase citing disagreement over intellectual property control. The pair subsequently sued each other. Tension eased after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard in October, which was followed by changes in management.While the timing and further details are still to be announced, the renewed agreement will allow Chinese players to regain access to games they previously enjoyed under the prior deal before it lapsed.Separately, Microsoft Gaming and NTES also announced an agreement to explore bringing new NetEase titles to Xbox consoles and other platforms as part of MSFT's commitment to bringing more games to more players around the world.\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\nMicrosoft recently revealed the formation of a new team working on preserving Xbox's current library of games for future hardware, highlighting its importance to both Xbox and the gaming industry.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 12.9% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 11.4%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Microsoft teased its plans for next-generation Xbox hardware back in February, claiming that it was focused on delivering the largest technical leap for a new console generation with the next Xbox.Game preservation has become an increasingly pressing issue in recent years due to the prevalence of online requirements and digital formats. Many modern games, particularly live service titles, are unplayable without an Internet connection and risk disappearing permanently when servers are shut down.MSFT's commitment to game preservation aligns with its strong track record of backward compatibility. The Xbox 360 backward compatibility program, which allows players to enjoy hundreds of popular Xbox 360 games on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles, remains one of the platform's most beloved features.Microsoft's identity as a platform owner has come under the strain of late as Xbox Series S/X console sales lag far behind Sony's SONY PS5 and Nintendo NTDOY Switch.Its decision to release some Xbox exclusive titles on PS5 and Nintendo Switch and a sore lack of triple-A exclusives on its own platform has left the company in a perceivably weakened position in the console market.Microsoft, however, boasts a strong portfolio of game studios, especially since its successful acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year in a $69 billion deal that set a record for takeovers in the video game industry. The combined entity ranks No. 3 among global games publishers, behind Tencent Holdings and Sony.The launch of Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass has quickly made Xbox the game's most popular platform. Additionally, MSFT is preparing for the upcoming releases of highly anticipated titles, such as Hellblade II, Avowed and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which are likely to bring much needed wind in Xbox's sails.While Microsoft has not revealed a launch window for the next generation of Xbox consoles, court documents from the FTC trial in June last year revealed that the company expects the next-generation Xbox and PS6 to launch in 2028.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nIf you\u2019re looking to generate steady passive income from your investments, dividend stocks like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) might seem like an obvious choice. After all, the tech giant has been a reliable dividend payer for years, consistently increasing its quarterly payout. But before you start loading up on Microsoft shares, let\u2019s crunch the numbers.\nTo earn $100 per month in dividends from Microsoft, you\u2019d need to own a staggering 400 shares at the current quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. With Microsoft trading around $409 as of this writing, that would require an eye-watering investment of $163,600.\nSure, you\u2019d be generating a cool $1,200 per year in dividend income. But that only translates to a paltry 0.73% yield on your investment. Suddenly, the passive income dream starts to look a bit less dreamy.\nWhat if I told you there was a way to earn significantly higher yields without having to tie up hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single stock? Enter Arrived Homes, the real estate investing platform that lets you buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100.\nOn Arrived, the average annualized dividend yield across all offerings is an enticing 4.2%\u2014that\u2019s over five times higher than Microsoft\u2019s current yield. And unlike Microsoft, which pays dividends quarterly, Arrived investors get paid every single month.\nLet\u2019s do the math: To generate $100 per month in passive income at a 4.2% yield, you\u2019d need to invest just $28,571. That\u2019s a fraction of the $163,600 you\u2019d have to sink into Microsoft shares to achieve the same income stream.\nBut here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 you don\u2019t need to come up with that full $28,571 all at once. With Arrived, you can get started with just $100 and build your portfolio over time by investing in $10 shares of individual rental properties. That means you can start generating meaningful passive income right away and scale up at your own pace. To help you grow your portfolio even faster, those monthly dividends can be reinvested right back into more properties if you choose.\nOf course, no investment is without risk. But by diversifying across multiple properties \u2013 each carefully vetted by the platform\u2019s team of real estate experts \u2013 you can potentially mitigate some of the risks associated with owning physical real estate directly.\nThe bottom line? While Microsoft may be a rock-solid company, its dividend alone is unlikely to fund your financial freedom anytime soon. For investors seeking higher yields and the ability to start small, Arrived\u2019s rental property shares offer a compelling alternative.\nSo why settle for a measly 0.73% yield when there are reliable higher yield options available? Click here to explore current offerings and start building your passive income portfolio today.\nThis article How Many Microsoft Shares Do You Need To Earn $100 Per Month In Dividends?

Intel Corporation INTC unveiled the Intel Core Ultra featuring the neural processing unit, which enables power-efficient AI acceleration with 2.5x better power efficiency than the previous generation.Last month, Microsoft introduced two new devices, namely the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6. These AI-powered PCs cater specifically to business needs, featuring Copilot integration and advanced hardware specifications, such as Intel Core Ultra processors and Neural Processing Units for AI experiences.Microsoft has also agreed to pay $650 million in order to license Inflection AI\u2019s artificial intelligence software, alongside the company\u2019s recent move to hire the startup\u2019s co-founders, Mustafa Suleyman and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan. MSFT will also hire Inflection AI\u2019s 70 employees. As part of the deal, the company will pay $620 million to license Inflection\u2019s AI models and around $30 million for waiving any legal rights related to the mass hiring.Shares of the company have gained 11.9% compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 11.4% year to date.

It\u2019ll also give AI training to 200,000 people in Malaysia and work with the government to boost the nation\u2019s cybersecurity capabilities.\nMicrosoft is vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to win over businesses in Southeast Asia, a fast-digitizing region of more than 650 million people. Tech companies are expanding their operations in Malaysia and nearby countries such as Singapore, diversifying beyond China to reduce geopolitical risks amid tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\u201cWe are committed to supporting Malaysia\u2019s AI transformation and ensure it benefits all Malaysians,\u201d Nadella said at the end of a whistle-stop tour of three countries in the region. In Kuala Lumpur, he met Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before addressing business leaders and developers at a company event.\nThe investment is the biggest by Microsoft in its 32 years in Malaysia and underscores Microsoft\u2019s effort to emerge as a winner in Asia. Nadella has pledged at least $7 billion to build out the company\u2019s services from Japan to India, while touting AI as a growth engine and prodding countries to boost investment in the technology.\nIn Malaysia, the southern Johor Bahru region \u2014 connected by a causeway to Singapore \u2014 is emerging as one of Asia\u2019s rising AI data center hotspots. Nvidia Corp. last year teamed up with local utility YTL Power International Bhd. to build a $4.3 billion AI data center park in the area.\nAI adoption is still nascent in Southeast Asia but has the potential to add about $1 trillion to the region\u2019s economy by 2030, with Malaysia capturing about $115 billion of that, according to a report by consulting firm Kearney.\nMicrosoft this week said it\u2019ll train a total 2.5 million people in AI skills in Southeast Asia by 2025. About 680,000 developers in Malaysia used the Microsoft-owned coding platform GitHub platform in 2023, a 28% annual increase.\nEarlier during his trip, Nadella announced a $1.7 billion investment in Indonesia and an undisclosed amount in Thailand in similar efforts to build out AI cloud and digital infrastructure.

        "Title": "Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft earnings will be all about AI and whether one of them deserves to be on the \u2018wall of worry\u2019",
        "Author": "  Rachyl Jones ",
        "Text": "Since the blockbuster debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022, the topic of AI has dominated the earnings calls of many tech companies. Executives from Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have mentioned the acronym nearly 200 times in each earnings cycle since, including during the first earnings week this year in January and February.\nAnalysts expect AI to be the central theme yet again during earnings calls for the first three months of this year, with Meta reporting on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet on Thursday. But the talk from executives has shifted from \u201cwhat AI can do?\u201d to \u201cwhat AI is doing?,\u201d and all three of this week\u2019s Big Tech companies will have a different answer.\nFor Microsoft, cloud computing platform Azure is the star of its AI portfolio, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs and Citi. Launched more than a decade ago, Azure now offers a suite of AI tools to businesses including a service that builds custom generative AI apps from existing models. Azure is \u201cone of the best-positioned AI players\u201d in the market and the \u201cmain lever\u201d for Microsoft to make money on generative AI right now, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note to investors. That confidence partly comes from Microsoft not having to drastically change how it makes money to drive additional revenue from AI, they wrote.\nIn contrast, most of Google\u2019s revenue comes from search and related services, which AI from other companies could eventually replace. Google could cannibalize its search business by building a rival AI one, but that would leave it in a precarious position.\nAzure\u2019s business grew 30% year-over-year for the quarter ending December 31, with six points of that growth coming directly from the demand by its customers for AI-related products, CFO Amy Hood said during the company\u2019s earnings call. Expect an additional one to two percentage points of growth from AI services for the first three months of 2024, Citi analysts said in an April 18 report. Microsoft also has other budding AI businesses that the analysts say will contribute meaningfully to revenue next year\u2014namely, the company\u2019s virtual assistant, Copilot.\nAnalysts are generally less confident in Google\u2019s business than in Microsoft\u2019s, with Goldman analysts calling its parent\u2019s stock a \u201cwall of worry.\u201d In addition to questioning the growth of\u00a0 Google\u2019s search business in an AI future, investors worry about the company\u2019s operating margins and the impact of potential regulation. Investors will also have \u201ca heightened degree of concern\u201d about how much Google is spending on AI over the coming earnings seasons, Goldman\u2019s analysts wrote.\nStill, Google is a leader in the AI cloud world, which includes many of the services it offers to other businesses, Goldman analysts said in an April 15 report. At Google\u2019s Cloud Next event earlier this month, the company announced expanded access to large language model Gemini and an AI-powered coding assistant.\nWhile Meta offers an AI assistant and large language model similar to Microsoft\u2019s and Google\u2019s\u2014including its new Llama 3 model introduced last week, which is free for research and commercial use\u2014that\u2019s not what analysts have their eyes on. In notes from Goldman, Citi, and Bank of America, analysts put much more emphasis on how Meta is using AI to improve its social media algorithms.\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, makes most of its money from advertising. The more time users spend scrolling through their feeds, the more ads they see, and the more revenue Meta generates. In recent months, the company has been working on rebuilding its model for recommending videos to Facebook users, with the help of AI. If effective, the tweak could keep users on Meta\u2019s platforms for longer. When tested on Facebook Reels last year, the new AI-powered technology contributed to \u201can 8% to 10% gain in Reels watch time,\u201d Facebook head Tom Alison said at a tech conference last month.\nIt is still early for these tools, Bank of America analysts said in an April 19 note, but that means investors could enjoy some \u201cpositive product surprises\u201d and revenue growth this year. And with a potential U.S. ban on TikTok, a major competitor, Meta's business is looking well positioned at the moment, they said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.7%.\nRevenues are expected to be $60.63 billion, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Microsoft?\nFor Microsoft, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.36%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Microsoft will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Microsoft would post earnings of $2.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.93, delivering a surprise of +6.16%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nMicrosoft doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAnother stock from the Zacks Computer - Software industry, Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.13 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -12.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.01 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Cadence has been revised 0.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.22%.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Cadence will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock opened for trading at $38.60.\nThe upsized IPO hauled in $752 million for Rubrik's expansion plans, initially valuing the company at $5.6 billion.\nIt was just this January when Rubrik \u2014 which Microsoft (MSFT) has invested in since 2021 \u2014 raised a Series E round that valued the company at $3.3 billion. That round was led by Bain, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Greylock, and Khosla Ventures. The firm was valued at around $1.8 billion in a prior 2017 raise.\n\"The company is one to watch,\" an early Rubrik investor told Yahoo Finance.\nA key part of Rubrik's selling point is its well-regarded tech exec, Sinha.\nThe former engineer has spent extensive time in the venture capital industry. As a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sinha put dollars behind names such as Nutanix (NTNX) and Pulse News. (Lightspeed is now a major shareholder in Rubrik, with about 24.9% of shares outstanding).\nHe has also held engineering positions at Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM).\nSinha founded Rubrik in 2014, working in coffee shops by the offices of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube in an effort to hire top developer talent.\nHe doesn't hide his modest upbringing, which has fueled his business building. \"Maximal thinking is how I lifted myself out of poverty,\" Sinha wrote in a letter in the company's IPO prospectus.\n\"He is the American Dream come true.\" Lightspeed Venture Partner's co-founder and partner Ravi Mhatre told Yahoo Finance.\nSinha said he remains as hungry as ever, despite the newfound attention around Rubrik and its future.\nWhile the cybersecurity market remains in growth mode, Rubrik does have to prove its worth to Wall Street.

        "Title": "Is Microsoft\u2019s $100 billion \u2018Stargate\u2019 OpenAI supercomputer AI\u2019s \u2018Star Wars\u2019 moment?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Kahn ",
        "Text": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have been discussing a project called \u201cStargate\u201d that would see Microsoft spend $100 billion to build a massive supercomputing cluster to support OpenAI\u2019s future advanced AI models, The Information reported Friday.\nTo put this in context, Microsoft is known to have spent more than \u201cseveral hundred million dollars\u201d to build the clusters used to train OpenAI\u2019s current top-of-the-line model GPT-4, which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also has said cost more than $100 million to train. It's also known that OpenAI is already training a successor model to GPT-4, likely called GPT-5, on one of Microsoft\u2019s existing data centers. And we know that Microsoft last year broke ground on a new $1 billion data center in Wisconsin that analysts believe is intended to house the chips for training OpenAI\u2019s next-generation models\u2014probably due out in 2025 or 2026. The Information reported that this supercomputing cluster in Wisconsin may eventually cost as much as $10 billion, once the price of specialized Nvidia chips used for AI applications are factored in. So Stargate is anywhere from 10 to 100 times more expensive than any of the data centers Microsoft currently has on the books.\nOf course, $100 billion is a lot of money, even for Microsoft. It's more than three times what the company spent on capital expenditures in 2023 and twice the amount it is on pace to spend this year. It is also more than almost any company, including those in far more capital-intensive sectors, spends on capex annually: Saudi Aramco, for instance, spent about $50 billion on capital projects last year. It's also two-thirds of the entire amount Amazon's AWS has said it plans to spend on all new data centers over the next 15 years.\nSkeptics of today\u2019s approaches to AI seized on the Stargate story as an \u201cAI jumps the shark\u201d moment. The only way a single OpenAI model could justify such an outlandish investment on a single data center, they said, was if that model were in fact AGI\u2014or artificial general intelligence, or a single AI system that could perform most cognitive tasks as well or better a human. Achieving AGI is OpenAI\u2019s founding mission. But since some of these skeptics doubt AGI is achievable within the next decade, they predicted this investment\u2014if Microsoft does, in fact, make it\u2014would prove foolish. Gary Marcus, the AI expert who has emerged as a perpetual critic of most neural network-based approaches to AI, called Stargate \u201cthe second worst AI investment in history\u201d\u2014comparing it to the more than $100 billion companies have plowed into self-driving cars, which today only operate in a few limited geographies. But remember, that $100 billion was spent by many different investors and companies. Stargate would be all Microsoft.\nWhat\u2019s more, Microsoft has to hope that whatever Stargate is being used for, it is not in fact to train AGI, since Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI only entitles the tech giant to commercialize OpenAI\u2019s technology that falls short of AGI. Once OpenAI\u2019s board decides AGI has been achieved, the company doesn't have to share that technology with Microsoft. For Microsoft to invest so much in training an OpenAI model, it must be reasonably sure that the model will be very capable, but not yet so capable as to qualify as AGI.\nBeyond this inherent contradiction at the heart of the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership, Project Stargate signals several other things. Jack Clark, who in addition to heading policy at OpenAI rival Anthropic writes a good newsletter on AI, Import AI, points out that the seemingly soaring capital intensity of advanced AI has important implications for AI policy. Capital-intensive industries, such as mining or oil and gas, tend to be highly concentrated, with a handful of large companies dominating the market. They also tend to be heavily regulated. Project Stargate may be an indication this is where AI is headed.\nBut there are other interesting implications for both policy and corporate strategy. In some ways, we may come to see Stargate as AI\u2019s Star Wars moment. And no, I don\u2019t mean the movie. I am referring to the nickname for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space-based antiballistic missile system President Ronald Reagan announced the U.S. intended to build in 1983. The important thing about SDI was not the tech\u2014most of which didn\u2019t exist when Reagan declared the U.S. would build the system (and in fact, the whole project was later scrapped). What mattered was the audacious ambition and its eye-watering projected price tag\u2014which at the time was estimated to be $30 billion ($93 billion in today\u2019s dollars) over its first six years with estimates ranging from $100 billion to $1 trillion over the first decade. Many analysts have since claimed that those costs convinced the Soviet Union\u2019s leadership that the country could not compete economically with the U.S. The Soviets simply didn't have the money to try to match the American investment while also modernizing their missiles to try to defeat the U.S. antimissile system. There are indications that this realization was among the factors that persuaded the Soviet leadership to begin economic reforms and political liberalization that ultimately hastened the collapse of the entire Soviet system.\nStargate may play a similar role between both companies\u2014and countries. Microsoft currently operates with about a 35% profit margin. Meta\u2019s is similar. Google\u2019s is slightly less at 24%. Amazon, whose AWS service is another big cloud rival, operates at just 8% margins. If you are Amazon, are you really willing to spend $100 billion on a single data center to match Microsoft? What happens when the costs for the data center for the model beyond this next generation hits $200 billion? Stargate could well convince one of these companies that it can\u2019t afford to be in the frontier model business.\nThe geopolitics of this are interesting too. Most of the large companies building frontier AI models are American. If you are China, which sees advanced AI, and certainly AGI, as a strategic asset, you are facing the prospect of the U.S. having not one but perhaps four or five $100 billion AI supercomputers being built in the next five years, all at no direct cost to the U.S. government. Meanwhile, China has been subsidizing some of the efforts by its internet companies, such as Baidu, to build AI supercomputing clusters, partly because these companies have been cut off from the most advanced AI chips produced by Nvidia and partly because of fears they may be falling behind their U.S. tech company rivals. At some point, Beijing may decide it can't afford to match the American effort like-for-like. This could have several effects, one of which might be to drive China to find other ways to race for AGI\u2014maybe trying to find a path to AGI that does not depend on transformer-based neural networks and GPUs. It could put more money into different kinds of algorithms or different kinds of chips, perhaps achieving a surprise breakthrough. It could also redouble efforts to steal and then replicate U.S.-made AI models.\nWe\u2019ll be watching to see how these dynamics play out in the coming months and years.\nThere\u2019s more AI news below. But first, if you\u2019re enjoying reading this newsletter, how would you like to participate in a live version\u2014chatting in person with me and many of the world\u2019s foremost experts on deploying AI within companies?

        "Text": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella shared his optimistic perspective on the impact artificial intelligence (AI) will have on the workforce during a recent visit to India.\nKnown for spearheading Microsoft\u2019s aggressive push into AI technologies, Nadella\u2019s insights come at a crucial time as debates intensify over the role of AI in the job market. AI, like many burgeoning technologies, continues to disrupt many industries, highlighting the lucrative but volatile nature of startups and venture capital.\nUnder Nadella\u2019s leadership, Microsoft has become a significant player in the AI field, particularly following its substantial investment in OpenAI.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here\u2019s how anyone can invest for a limited time.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\nMicrosoft has invested in many other AI startups, including OpenAI competitor Mistral AI, which is \"committed to bringing technology and people together to realize the promises of AI responsibly.\"\nContrary to the widespread fears that AI might lead to job displacement, Nadella argues that AI can boost wages and enhance job quality. AI acts as a lever of expertise that empowers frontline workers across industries by equipping them with enhanced capabilities previously beyond their reach, Nadella said.\n\u201cI think of the AI era as expertise at your fingertips so you can take somebody who\u2019s in the front line, whether it\u2019s in retail or whether it is in healthcare. It perhaps will even improve the wages because they are now able to give more expert health advice or more expert work is being done by nonexperts.\nTrending: Invest like a millionaire. Exclusive opportunity to invest in Epic Games $17 billion gaming empire.\nThey may have domain expertise, but they may not have all the knowledge, and so therefore I think that they could even be better at wage supporting new jobs,\" Nadella said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.\nA recent study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delves into the economic implications of AI. The report suggests that AI\u2019s impact on labor income will largely depend on how well AI complements high-income workers.\n\u201cThe effect on labor income will largely depend on the extent to which AI will complement high-income workers. If AI significantly complements higher-income workers, it may lead to a disproportionate increase in their labor income. Moreover, gains in productivity from firms that adopt AI will likely boost capital returns, which may also favor high earners,\u201d the IMF study said.\nAs the discussion around AI and its impact on the workforce evolves, Nadella\u2019s comments add a crucial perspective to the conversation, suggesting that the integration of AI could lead to better job quality and higher wages for those equipped to leverage the technology.\nKeep Reading About Startups:\nRetail invested +$2 million in this tech-forward startup taking on a $272 billion industry.\nThis startup coined \u201ceBay for gamers\u201d with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nMICROSOFT (MSFT): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Instead Of Taking Jobs, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Says, 'AI Will Help Increase Wages' As Employees Can Provide More Expertise originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. and Google owner Alphabet Inc. sent a clear message to investors on Thursday: Our spending on artificial intelligence and cloud computing is paying off.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market\nNYPD Arrests Over 300 Protesters in Crackdown on College Campuses\nFed to Signal Delay of Interest-Rate Cuts\nLilly Soars as Forecast Boost Shows Weight-Loss Drugs\u2019 Power\nAmazon Posts Biggest Cloud Sales Growth in Year on AI Demand\nThe companies trounced Wall Street estimates with their latest quarterly results, lifted by a surge in cloud revenue \u2014 fueled in part by booming use of AI services. Alphabet shares surged as much as 12%, the biggest gain since July 2015, to their highest level ever. The rally pushed Alphabet\u2019s valuation past $2 trillion. Microsoft rose as much as 3.5%.\nThe tech titans have been locked in a fierce battle for dominance in the field of artificial intelligence, with Microsoft joining forces with startup OpenAI to challenge Google\u2019s two-decade stranglehold on internet search. But Thursday\u2019s results showed there\u2019s ample room for both companies to grow.\nSilicon Valley has hailed 2024 as the year that companies will begin to deploy generative AI \u2014 technology that can create text, images and videos from simple prompts. In back-to-back earnings calls, Alphabet and Microsoft executives said the programs are driving more business for their cloud computing units.\nCorporate customers are more open to making long-term investments in their cloud infrastructure, said Tejas Dessai, research analyst at Global X ETFs. That\u2019s helped make the sometimes-volatile industry more reliable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear from these earnings from Microsoft and Google that cloud infrastructure demand is starting to normalize,\u201d Dessai said. \u201cFoundational cloud infrastructure is showing healthy growth.\u201d\nRising cloud computing demand comes as a welcome turn for Google, which has long trailed Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft in the market. After breaking even for the first time last year, Google\u2019s cloud operation posted first-quarter profit of $900 million \u2014 well ahead of analysts\u2019 projections of $672.4 million. The unit is viewed as one of Google\u2019s best bets for growth as its core search advertising business matures.\n\u201cFor years, Google Cloud was usually a weak spot during Alphabet\u2019s earnings calls,\u201d said Lee Sustar, a principal analyst with Forrester Research Inc. \u201cThese latest results show that Google Cloud\u2019s AI offerings not only got enterprise customers to take another look, but spend some serious money.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks in the consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model Gemini was roundly criticized after it spit out historically inaccurate images, prompting the company to stop generating depictions of people.\nThe enterprise side of the market has been a very different story, according to Google Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian. The professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help marketers ensure that the content is staying consistent with their brands. The service can be used to produce ads, ward off cyber threats, and even create videos and podcasts.\n\u201cWe are really excited about the benefit from AI for our cloud customers,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on Thursday. \u201cWe saw an increasing contribution from our AI solutions.\u201d\nFor Microsoft, generative AI is letting the company wring more spending from its core enterprise clients. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been infusing Microsoft\u2019s entire product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI. The bet is starting to pay off, with some customers adding AI tools that summarize documents and generate content. They\u2019re also signing up for Azure cloud subscriptions featuring OpenAI products.\nMicrosoft said sales of its Azure cloud computing platform climbed 31% in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations. About 7% of that increase was attributable to AI, compared with 6% in the previous quarter, and Microsoft is pleased with customer adoption so far, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing healthy growth really across Azure, in the non-AI and AI services, which is important,\u201d Hood said. \u201cWhile of course it\u2019s still early in the long-term AI monetization opportunity, we feel good about where we are.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s GitHub coding platform is also gaining traction, recording 1.8 million customers during the period, up from 1.3 million last quarter. The AI-coding assistant is powered by OpenAI\u2019s large language model and helps streamline developers\u2019 work by predicting lines of code, answering questions and converting code from one programming language to another. Corporate subscribers range from small startups to large businesses like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Ernst & Young.\nThe company is also seeing promising initial uptake for an AI assistant meant to work with its Office software. The new tools cost companies an extra $30 a month on top of existing subscriptions. Nadella told analysts almost 60% of Fortune 500 customers are using the Copilot.\nNot everyone reporting earnings on Thursday had good news to share. Intel Corp. gave a lackluster forecast for sales and profit in the current quarter, sending its shares tumbling in extended trading. The chipmaker said it expects business to pick up again in the second half of the year.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet needed to deliver a strong performance to avoid spooking investors, who sent shares of Meta Platforms Inc. down Thursday after the Facebook parent said during its Wednesday\u2019s earnings that it would invest billions of dollars more than expected on AI. Alphabet spent $12 billion on capital expenditures in the quarter, roughly twice its total from the year-ago quarter, and Porat told investors to expect similar spending for the rest of the year. After investing $14 billion in capital expenditures during the quarter, Microsoft said its spending will continue to rise.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the AI demand continue to grow, and so we\u2019ll continue to work to match that,\u201d Hood said.\n--With assistance from Dina Bass and Davey Alba.\n(Updates shares in second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy\nAI Is Helping Automate One of the World\u2019s Most Gruesome Jobs\nTesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes\nElon Musk vs. Jeff Bezos Is America\u2019s New Moon Race\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Under the arrangement, G42 agreed to pare back its presence in China or face potentially punitive measures from Washington, they said.\nThe talks were part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to rein in China\u2019s technological prowess and line up support around the world. G42 is backed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, an influential member of Abu Dhabi\u2019s ruling family, and looks to become an AI superpower in the Middle East.\nG42 Chief Executive Officer Peng Xiao told Bloomberg News in February that the firm would divest from China, but the details behind that decision weren\u2019t public. According to the people familiar with the talks, US officials \u2014 led by BIS, with the blessing of the National Security Council \u2014 approached the UAE last summer and told executives they would have to choose between the US or China.\nThe BIS negotiations involved Xiao, Sheikh Tahnoon, UAE Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba, and veteran Paul Hastings lawyer Marty Edelman, who serves as G42\u2019s general counsel.\nA representative for BIS declined to comment. In a statement, a G42 spokesman said that the divestment decision stemmed from a desire \u201cto partner with the most sophisticated AI technology companies in the world \u2014 the ones in the US and, in some cases, Europe.\u201d\n\u201cGeopolitical factors affect every international business, including ours,\u201d the spokesman said. The chance to work with Microsoft and its partner OpenAI \u201cwere authentic economic and technological transformative opportunities for us. Clearly these opportunities required a movement away from Chinese relationships, equipment and services, and we are in the process of making that transition in a verifiable way.\u201d\nIn exchange for the Chinese divestment, G42 was assured that it would have continued access to US technology that powers AI applications, one of the people said. That includes chips from Nvidia Corp. But the agreement came at considerable cost to G42, according to one of the people, because it had to remove some Chinese technology from its systems.\nThe divestment plan also helped lay the groundwork for Microsoft to invest $1.5 billion in G42 \u2014 an agreement announced Tuesday. As part of that pact, Microsoft President Brad Smith will join the board of G42, which will use the software maker\u2019s Azure cloud for its AI applications. The agreement, which builds on an existing partnership, was reached after consultation with the UAE and US governments.\nG42, the largest AI company in the UAE, came under scrutiny from Congress in recent months, with a key lawmaker calling for sanctions over its ties to blacklisted Chinese businesses Huawei Technologies Co. and Beijing Genomics Institute. The firm \u201ccategorically\u201d denied that it had \u201cconnections to the Chinese government and their military industrial complex.\u201d\nRead More: US Lawmaker Urges Probe of UAE Firm G42\u2019s Ties to China\nThe deal with the Biden administration followed warnings from the State Department and elsewhere that putting G42 on an export blacklist would be catastrophic for the US-UAE relationship. The firm, which aims to apply AI to everything from medicine to space exploration, is a prized asset of Sheikh Tahnoon. The G42 spokesman said that US officials didn\u2019t threaten sanctions during the talks.\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visited the UAE in March to discuss G42\u2019s progress in shifting away from China, among other topics, according to some of the people.\nIt\u2019s the latest example of Washington\u2019s increased focus on AI and semiconductor ambitions in the Middle East, where Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are both vying to become major tech hubs.\nThe Commerce Department expanded export controls last year on semiconductor technology. It now requires a license for the sale of advanced chips and tools to countries that officials worry China could use as intermediaries to skirt US controls, including several in the Middle East. Wealth funds from that region have also drawn scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States over their ties to Beijing.\nBut the region is also a favorite among American companies and executives, including Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, which are bolstering their Middle Eastern presence as sovereign wealth funds pour billions into cutting-edge technology.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store\nRents Are the Fed\u2019s \u2018Biggest Stumbling Block\u2019 in Taming US Inflation\nAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand\nThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance \nFor Multinationals, Africa\u2019s Allure Is Fading\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

These titles are expected to start returning to mainland China this summer.\n\"After continuing discussions over the past year, both Blizzard Entertainment and NetEase are thrilled to align on a path forward to once again support players in mainland China and are proud to reaffirm their commitment to delivering exceptional gaming experiences,\" according to the statement.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nLast January, the two companies suspended services for all Blizzard titles in the mainland, except for Diablo Immortal, a mobile title co-developed by NetEase and Blizzard, as their 14-year partnership came to an end. Both sides blamed each other for treating Chinese players badly after failing to agree to new terms to extend the deal.\nThe latest announcement comes five months after US tech giant Microsoft finalised its US$68.7 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard, the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment.\nSeparately, the new deal also deepens cooperation between Microsoft and NetEase, aiming to bring new NetEase titles to Xbox consoles and other platforms, according to the statement.\n\"Returning Blizzard's legendary games to players in China while exploring ways to bring more new titles to Xbox demonstrates our commitment to bringing more games to more players around the world,\" said Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming.\nWorld of Warcraft is published by US video gaming giant Blizzard Entertainment.

The return of Blizzard was the top trending topic on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo immediately after the announcement, achieving over 100 million views within two hours.\n\"I've been wandering in foreign servers for over a year, and finally I can come back home,\" one Weibo user commented.\nHowever, there is still work to be done before the games become available for Chinese players. NetEase is looking to hire positions including game operations planners, engineers and project managers for World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch under its gaming studio Leihuo, according to new job posts on Wednesday.\nAfter the previous partnership ended last January, NetEase disbanded the local team responsible for operating Blizzard titles in Shanghai, the Post reported earlier.\nr.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "  Jackie Davalos and Dina Bass ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 When software developer Nikolai Avteniev got his hands on a preview version of Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Copilot coding assistant in 2021, he quickly saw the potential.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding\nChina Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel\nWhat If Fed Rate Hikes Are Actually Sparking US Economic Boom?\nPowell Signals Rate-Cut Delay After Run of Inflation Surprises\nRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs\nDeveloped by Microsoft\u2019s GitHub coding platform and based on a version of OpenAI\u2019s generative artificial intelligence, the assistant wasn\u2019t perfect and sometimes got things wrong. But Avteniev, who works for ticket seller StubHub, was surprised by how ably it finished lines of code with just a few prompts. All he had to do was press the tab key, and Copilot filled in the rest.\n\u201cInstead of using 15 keystrokes, it took three,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cIt was nice a little speed boost.\u201d\nThree years later, and now infused with the latest version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 technology, GitHub\u2019s Copilot can do a lot more, including answering engineers\u2019 questions and converting code from one programming language to another. As a result, the assistant is responsible for an increasingly significant percentage of the software being written and is even being used to program corporations\u2019 critical systems.\nAlong the way, Copilot is gradually revolutionizing the working lives of software engineers\u2014the first professional cohort to use generative AI en masse. Microsoft says Copilot has attracted 1.3 million customers so far, including 50,000 businesses ranging from small startups to corporations like Goldman Sachs, Ford and Ernst & Young. Engineers say Copilot saves them hundreds of hours a month by handling tedious and repetitive tasks, affording them time to focus on knottier challenges.\nAcquired by Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5 billion, GitHub dominates its market and is betting Copilot has the AI horsepower to fight off rival services including Tabnine, Amazon\u2019s CodeWhisperer and Google-backed Replit Ghostwriter. GitHub\u2019s AI assistant is also a kind of beta test for a host of other Copilots that Microsoft is baking into Office, Windows, Bing and other business lines.\nAs is true with AI generally, GitHub Copilot has limitations. Developers say it sometimes pulls up outdated code, provides unhelpful answers to questions and generates suggestions that are buggy or could infringe copyright. Because the tool is trained on public and open repositories of code, engineers run the risk of replicating security issues or injecting new ones into their work, particularly if they blindly accept Copilot\u2019s recommendations.\nGitHub emphasizes that the tool is an assistant, not a substitute for human programmers, and has put the onus on customers to use it wisely. Robust guidelines are required to prevent lazy programmers from simply accepting what Copilot suggests, said GitHub Chief Executive Officer Thomas Dohmke. He expressed confidence that engineers would keep one another honest.\n\u201cThe social dynamic of the team will make sure that those that are cheating by accepting code too fast and that don't actually go through the process defined by the team, that code will not make it into production,\u201d he said in an interview.\nGenerative AI is the latest in a long line of innovations that have transformed computer coding over the years. Last century, program compilers accelerated software development by rapidly translating commands into ones and zeros that computers can understand. More recently, Linux popularized open-source coding, letting programmers leverage one another\u2019s work rather than writing everything from scratch.\nCoding assistants like GitHub\u2019s Copilot could be even more revolutionary because generative AI holds the potential power to automate large swathes of what software engineers currently do.\nFor now, it mostly makes them more efficient. StubHub\u2019s Avteniev, who also teaches software engineering at City College of New York, says Copilot\u2019s predictive ability helps programmers stay in \u201cthe flow\u201d because they no longer have to stop to look things up. Avteniev has been coding for more than 20 years, but even he sometimes forgets programming languages\u2014forcing him to waste time Googling them. \u201cCopilot stops you from having to exit your current coding process,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when it produces gibberish, it\u2019s still easier to just accept what it does and then correct it myself.\u201d\nAaron Hedges, a developer for more than 15 years, was getting burned out before Copilot arrived. Hedges works for ReadMe, a startup that helps companies create technical descriptions of their application programming interfaces, or APIs. Like Avteniev, he makes good use of Copilot\u2019s auto-complete function. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a fairly senior engineer, I can look at that and go, \u2018Oh yeah, that looks right.\u2019\u201d He also likes that he can ask questions without leaving his programming window. \u201cI don\u2019t have to shift away and open a browser, which can be really disruptive,\u201d he said.\nAt $10 a month, a Copilot subscription is a bargain that Hedges willingly pays himself. After work, he builds websites for Dungeons & Dragons fans. With a toddler and another baby on the way, leisure time is precious. \u201cThose two hours I get to myself to code in the evening are super important to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more efficient I can be, the better.\u201d\nFew tasks are more tedious than debugging software\u2014a process that can consume as much as 50% of an engineer\u2019s time. Figma, which helps developers design app or website interfaces, says Copilot can create defect-testing programs in minutes rather than hours. \u201cThat is the real value of AI,\u201d said Abhishek Mathur, the company\u2019s vice president of engineering. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t replace our work, but frees up our time to develop creative solutions.\u201d\nSome companies are starting to deploy Copilot to create code for critical systems. Brewer Carlsberg uses it to write code for an existing tool that helps the sales force plan, prepare for and document sales calls. Mindful of Copilot\u2019s limitations, the beer maker uses its own quality-assurance process to check that the code it has created works as intended, according to Chief Information Officer Sarah Haywood. Eventually, she said, companies will be able to outsource that task as well. \u201cAs time goes on, people will build more trust in AI,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be having to double-check everything that AI does, otherwise we\u2019re not really adding any value.\u201d\nIn an attempt to assess the technology\u2019s accuracy, Canada\u2019s University of Waterloo published an experiment last year. Researchers collected a dataset made up of code snippets that had known flaws and the fixes for those mistakes. The researchers prompted Copilot to create these exact snippets to see whether it would spit out the buggy versions. The assistant replicated the flawed version 33% of the time, less frequently than a human. In a quarter of the cases, the AI spit out code with the fix. Copilot generally was better at avoiding basic errors than more complex ones, said Mei Nagappan, a computer science professor at the school and one of the study\u2019s authors.\n\u201cThe analogy here is that we are in an era of driver assist right now, not yet at the self-driving stage,\u201d he said.\nSoftware engineers can be slow to change their work habits. Many welcome Copilot but are wary about becoming too reliant on it. A recent GitHub-funded study found developers accepted the assistant\u2019s suggestions just 27% of the time.\nEngineers also can be quick to blame Copilot if something goes awry. When Etsy\u2019s site crashed for short periods last October and December, some of the company\u2019s developers fingered Copilot for the outage. Etsy confirmed the incidents but disputed that Copilot was responsible. \u201cWhile we certainly understand that engineers may discuss how Copilot could theoretically play a role in outages or issues, we have zero evidence that the tool has actually led to any customer-facing impacts,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nCopilot is expected to improve dramatically in the coming years. GitHub is already rolling out enhancements, including an enterprise version that can answer questions based on a customer\u2019s own programming code, which should help new engineers get up to speed and enable veteran coders to work faster. In the coming months, GitHub also will let engineers use their employer\u2019s own codebase to help auto-complete programs they\u2019re working on. That will make the code generated more customized and helpful.\nGitHub can\u2019t afford to sit still. At least a dozen startups are looking to disrupt the market. Some are leveraging new models that have dramatically boosted the amount of information code assistants can draw on quickly, making it easier for them to generate entire programs. \u201cAn AI programmer that can see all of your code is going to be able to make much better decisions and write much more coherent code than one that can only sort of look at your code through a paper towel roll, a small amount at time,\u201d said Nat Friedman, an investor and former GitHub CEO.\nFriedman is backing a startup called Magic AI that plans to create \u201ca superhuman software engineer.\u201d Peter Thiel-backed Cognition AI, meanwhile, is working on an assistant that can handle software projects on its own. Princeton University this month released an open-source model for an AI software engineering agent, and it seems that not a week goes by without a new startup popping up.\nIn interviews, few coders expressed fears that AI will replace them. As in many industries, they say, automation will free them up to focus on more challenging and interesting tasks. But Jensen Huang, CEO of the red-hot AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp., has a less-rosy perspective. He recently predicted that coding as a career is doomed. Now that AI is making it possible to code in plain English, Huang said, anyone can become a programmer.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nFor Multinationals, Africa\u2019s Allure Is Fading\nA Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality\nCities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster\nThe Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Why Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Crashed on Thursday",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The biggest driver of headlines across the technology sector over the past year or so has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.\nWith that as a backdrop, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.\nTo be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space.\nMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.\nThe company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.\nThe results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.\nLike its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,\" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.\nMeta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, \"We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\nAs a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.\nSo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.\nCompany-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday.\nChinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports.\nThe potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.\nInvestors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs\u00a0Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.\nWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are selling for 33 times, 23 times, and 22 times forward earnings, respectively, while Amazon is trading for roughly 2 times forward sales. Furthermore, all four stocks have easily outpaced the performance of the S&P 500 over the past five years.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all industry leaders on the cutting edge of AI.

The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth. Microsoft got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promise.However, More Personal Computing revenues are suffering from continued weakness in Windows and Devices businesses. Declining gaming revenues have been a headwind.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+46.8% vs. +17.8%). The company\u2019s diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy have been performing well, fueled by increasing demand. Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.NVO has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by increasing its manufacturing capabilities.

Novo Nordisk recently received CHMP\u2019s recommendation for the approval of insulin icodec in the EU for diabetes.Novo Nordisk is also gearing up to buy Cardior to help diversify its portfolio beyond diabetes treatments and obesity drugs.

Rising capital expenses further add to its woes.Nevertheless, the Zacks analyst is encouraged by UPS' solid free cash flow. Shareholder-friendly actions includes a 15th consecutive annual dividend increase and a $5 billion share repurchase authorization.The 2022 UPS-ESW agreement aligns with the thriving cross-border e-commerce trend, especially among millennials and Gen Z.

        "Author": "  Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni ",
        "Text": "By Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni\n(Reuters) - Upcoming quarterly reports from U.S. tech giants may show Microsoft is closing the gap on cloud-computing market leader Amazon.com as more businesses switch to its services, attracted by a clutch of generative AI features that are powered by OpenAI's technology.\nThe Redmond, Washington-based software giant has beaten rivals Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet to the market with AI services including the Copilot, a set of genAI tools that work in Microsoft's business apps, that was rolled out in November for $30 a month.\nIts earnings on Thursday will be an indicator of AI adoption and could influence the movement of technology stocks as a rally in the sector eases this month amid worries that interest rates in the U.S. could stay high for longer.\nWall Street analysts expect Microsoft - which overtook Apple as the world's most valuable firm earlier this year - to report that the billions of dollars it has invested in generative AI were attracting clients to its Azure cloud-computing service.\n\"Azure is benefiting from a halo effect around Microsoft's AI strategy,\" said RBC Capital Markets Rishi Jaluria, who expects Microsoft to take Amazon's market share.\nJaluria added that cloud providers should broadly benefit from signs of stabilization in technology spending, which has been pressured by high-interest rates and economic uncertainty.\nIn the first three months of 2024, Microsoft's revenue is expected to have grown 15% and Alphabet's 12.6% - their second-highest rate in nearly two years. Amazon's revenue could rise 11.9%, its worst in three quarters.\nAzure, part of the Intelligent cloud unit at Microsoft, is expected to have grown 28.9% in the January-to-March period, according to estimates from Visible Alpha.\nThat compares with estimated growth of 14.9% for Amazon Web Service and 25% for Google Cloud, the third-largest cloud provider, according to LSEG data. Google-parent Alphabet reports earnings on Thursday and Amazon on April 30.\nCFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino estimated that up to 8 percentage points of Azure's growth could come from AI services.\nStill, much of the boost from AI is expected to be realized from next year, with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating a $5 billion revenue contribution from Copilot in Microsoft's fiscal 2025, which would start in July.\n\"Broader elements of generative AI story (like 365 Copilot) likely need more time to develop and work through enterprise purchasing cycles,\" Morgan Stanley said earlier this month.\nWhile Alphabet shares have gained over 13% so far this year and recently scaled a record high on optimism over its AI efforts including the Gemini models, several analysts said the company was not rushing to monetize the technology and that it may take longer for Google Cloud to benefit from AI integration.\nGoogle offers a slew of AI features within Workspace productivity apps, which are powered by its large language model Gemini, for up to $30 per user per month. Earlier this month, it announced two $10 add-on packages for AI meeting notes and summaries, and for added security features.\n\"Our checks at Google Cloud Next conference showed high interest levels and abundant innovation, but no rush to turn AI pilots into production apps,\" said analysts at Jefferies, who see a more meaningful boost in 2025.\nAmazon has not announced any major AI moves but is weaving the technology into AWS on the back of its $4 billion investment in OpenAI-competitor Anthropic.\n\"Microsoft has gained a lot of ground last year based on its AI prominence, but AWS is still a much bigger business and we expect Amazon to catch up to those capabilities over the next couple of years,\" said D.A. Davidson and Co analyst Gil Luria.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The speed with which artificial intelligence (AI) caught on last year took many investors by surprise, and it sparked a changing of the guard among the ranks of the world's most valuable companies. Apple was finally dethroned by Microsoft, which now tops the list as the only company that currently has a market cap of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its industry-leading AI processors, has tripled over the past year to take the No. 3 spot, behind Apple with $2.6 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all major players in the AI revolution and also members of this auspicious fraternity.\nWith a market cap of just $53 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like hyperbole to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, could make a run at the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI-centric servers and the company's decades of expertise suggest that Supermicro is a dark horse candidate in the race.\nWhile Supermicro has been creating customized server solutions for more than 30 years, the company was working in relative obscurity until the accelerating adoption of AI kicked off. It turns out that Supermicro has amassed quite a pedigree out of the glare of the spotlight.\nSupermicro has built its reputation by providing highly customizable, energy-efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale servers designed to handle the rigors of AI and hyperscale data centers. The company has developed strong working relationships and works hand-in-hand with all the top AI chipmakers to ensure its rack-scale servers are top performers while also providing energy efficiency and the lowest total cost of ownership in the industry. It boasts partnerships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\nThis is a winning strategy that has its AI-centric servers flying off the shelves. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 103% year over year to $3.7 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $5.10 jumped 85%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to $14.5 billion, which would represent growth of 104%.\nManagement reports that Supermicro grew five times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is stealing market share from its rivals. Analysts at Northland agree, suggesting the company has increased its market share to 11%, leaving \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nSupermicro is in an enviable position among AI server makers. The company is small enough to be nimble and has a long history of providing customized server solutions to enterprises. Furthermore, the strong and enduring relationships Supermicro has forged with chipmakers give it the inside track and an abundant supply of the processors used for AI. Despite those advantages and the clear opportunity, a lot will have to go right for Supermicro to join the ranks of the trillionaires.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.7 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $275 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. To be clear, the company is currently ramping up production to support annual sales of $25 billion, so revenue of that magnitude is still a ways off.\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit, year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2031. That said, it's unlikely the company will keep up its current rate of parabolic growth. If we cut its revenue growth rate assumption to 50%, Supermicro could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\nThere's reason to believe strong demand for AI-centric servers will continue. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya suggests the data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the next three years, and Supermicro's revenue could grow even faster.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is equally bullish, suggesting that the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the coming four to five years.\nIf Supermicro captures even a small part of that vast opportunity, the company will soon join the $1 trillion club.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Dan Loeb is known as a mover and a shaker in the investing world. He founded the New York-based hedge fund Third Point in 1995. It now has roughly $11.5 billion in assets under management. Loeb's net worth stands at $3.3 billion, according to Forbes.\nThe activist investor did some moving and shaking in his hedge fund's portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. Loeb reduced his stakes in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). However, the billionaire investor bought another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock.\nLoeb sold 210,000 shares of Microsoft in Q4. While this reduced Third Point's stake in the tech giant by over 9.4%, Microsoft remains the second-largest holding in the hedge fund's portfolio.\nThe billionaire investor has owned Microsoft off and on since 2006. He most recently initiated a new position in the fourth quarter of 2022, just in time to ride the generative AI wave started by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT. Microsoft was a major beneficiary of this wave thanks to its partnership with OpenAI.\nThird Point first owned Amazon in late 2019 and held the stock through the second quarter of 2022. Loeb didn't stay on the sidelines long with the e-commerce and cloud services leader. He initiated a new position in Amazon in the second quarter of 2023. Although he reduced Third Point's stake in the stock by nearly 10.3% in Q4 2023, Amazon still ranks as the hedge fund's third-largest holding.\nWhy did Loeb trim his positions in Amazon and Microsoft? The most likely reason is he wanted to take some profits. Both stocks delivered impressive gains last year.\nAlthough Loeb cooled somewhat on two Magnificent Seven stocks, he placed a bigger bet on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). The hedge fund manager increased Third Point's stake in Meta by nearly 5.5% in Q4 2023. The $410.6 million value of the position made Meta the sixth-largest holding for Third Point at the end of 2023.\nLoeb's history with Meta goes back to the second quarter of 2016 when he first bought the stock. He owned shares of the social media company for a little over two years before exiting the position. The activist investor again bought Meta stock in the second quarter of 2020 and maintained a position through 2021 Q4. Loeb went back to the well in the third quarter of 2023 with another new stake in Meta.\nLike Amazon and Microsoft, Meta enjoyed a generative AI tailwind last year. However, I suspect that wasn't Loeb's primary reason for adding to his position in the stock. Instead, my hunch is that Loeb liked Meta's moves to increase its profitability.\nThose efforts are paying off. Meta's earnings more than tripled year over year in 2023 Q4. Full-year profits jumped 69%.\nIn one sense, Loeb went one for three with these Magnificent Seven transactions. Loeb's decision to increase Third Point's stake in Meta is already paying off. Meta stock has skyrocketed over 45% since the end of 2023. However, Amazon and Microsoft are also up by double-digit percentages year to date. Loeb could have made more money by holding his shares in both companies.\nHowever, trimming the positions in Amazon and Microsoft could still have been the right call for Loeb. Both stocks make up significant percentages of Third Point's portfolio. You can't blame any investor for wanting to ensure their holdings aren't overly concentrated in a handful of stocks.\nOver the long term, I think that Loeb -- and other investors -- will be well served by owning all three of these stocks. Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses should continue to grow robustly thanks largely to AI. I like Meta's focus on business messaging and smart glasses with embedded AI assistants. I predict Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta will remain magnificent for a long time to come.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Rubrik's shares climbed nearly 21% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, giving the Microsoft-backed cybersecurity firm a valuation of $6.77 billion.\nThe startup joins a list of companies that have seen strong debuts recently as initial public offerings (IPOs) bounce back on hopes of a soft landing for the economy, where inflation falls without a recession or big job losses.\nThe rapid adoption of cloud applications for data storage and transfer has left businesses vulnerable to malicious attacks via the internet and boosted the appeal of cybersecurity firms.\nPalo Alto, California-based Rubrik provides data security solutions to more than 6,100 customers including appliance maker Whirlpool, snacks and beverages giant PepsiCo and investment bank Goldman Sachs.\nInitially named ScaleData, Rubrik competes with data management and protection vendors including Cohesity, Commvault, Veeam, IBM and Dell EMC.\nThe company's stock opened at $38.6, higher than the $32 IPO price, and were last trading at $37. Rubrik raised $752 million in the IPO.\nThe strong debut comes against the backdrop of weakness in the broader equities market. The Russell 2000 Index, which measures the performance of small-cap U.S. equities, has dropped nearly 7% so far this month.\nRubrik was founded in late 2013, but only began offering products and services in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2016. It is led by co-founder and CEO Bipul Sinha, who is also a venture partner at Silicon Valley's technology investment firm Lightspeed Venture Partners.\nMicrosoft made an equity investment in Rubrik in 2021 in a financing round that valued the startup at $4 billion. Venture capital firms Greylock Partners and Lightspeed have also backed the company.\nThe IPO was underwritten by a syndicate of more than a dozen banks including Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citigroup and Wells Fargo Securities.\n"

On the top line, the search engine leaders' Q1 sales are projected to be up 14% to $66.02 billion. Notably, Alphabet has surpassed earnings expectations for four straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 7.22%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs for Microsoft, the software titan has surpassed EPS estimates for six consecutive quarters and posted an average earnings surprise of 8.82% in its last four quarterly reports. Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share for its current fiscal third quarter which would reflect a 14% increase from a year ago. Plus, Microsoft\u2019s Q3 sales are projected to rise 15% to $60.63 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPerformance & Valuation Comparison\nCorrelating with their expansive growth trajectories, Alphabet\u2019s stock has risen +13% year to date with Microsoft shares up +8% to both outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +5% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +4%. Even better, GOOGL and MSFT have now soared over +40% in the last year which has also topped the strong performances of the broader indexes.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAt their current levels, Alphabet is more appealing in terms of P/E valuation and trades at a 23X forward earnings multiple which is near the S&P 500\u2019s 20.9X with Microsoft at 34.5X. It\u2019s also noteworthy that GOOGL still trades at a discount to its decade-long median of 26.1X whereas MSFT trades above its median and closer to its high of 37.4X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nOver the last 60 days, earnings estimate revisions for Q1 (Current Qtr) and Alphabet\u2019s FY24 have remained unchanged with FY25 EPS estimates slightly higher.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn contrast, earnings estimates for Microsoft\u2019s current quarer and FY24 have slightly decreased in the last two months while FY25 EPS estimates have remained unchanged.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTakeaway \nWhile both of these tech giants are expecting double-digit EPS growth in FY24 and FY25, Alphabet currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with Microsoft landing a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). \nThis is largely attributed to the trend of earnings estimate revisions which has remained favorable for Alphabet along with the company\u2019s P/E valuation whereas Microsoft trades at a bit of a premium to its big tech peer and FY24 EPS estimates have dipped.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Is Microsoft (MSFT) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Microsoft (MSFT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nMicrosoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 38 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 34 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 89.5% and 7.9% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Microsoft, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nShould You Invest in MSFT?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $11.61.\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Microsoft. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microsoft with a grain of salt.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Microsoft (MSFT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nMicrosoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 38 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 34 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 89.5% and 7.9% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Microsoft, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nShould You Invest in MSFT?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $11.61.\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Microsoft. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microsoft with a grain of salt.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "If you had seen the potential in Microsoft 10 years ago, would you have enough to retire today? Microsoft\u2019s stock has grown significantly in the last 10 years.\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead More: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nAny money you invested in Microsoft 10 years ago would be worth more than 10 times as much right now. So how much would you need to have invested in Microsoft in 2014 to retire now?\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nThe easiest way to calculate how much money you need to retire is to use the 4% rule. The 4% rule is a retirement strategy published by financial advisor Bill Bengen in 1994. According to his research, retirees who withdraw 4% of their retirement fund annually are unlikely to run out of money during their lifetimes. The research was done for a theoretical portfolio consisting of 50% bonds and 50% stocks.\nTo find the amount of money you need for retirement, you simply divide your current annual income by 4%. This means that if your annual income is currently $85,000 and you would like to maintain the same standard of living during retirement, you would need to save at least:\n$85,000/0.04 = $2,125,000\nThe latest Census placed the annual median income in the U.S. at $75,149 in 2022. Adjusting for inflation, that would be $82,948 in 2024. We can take this number and plug it into the 4% rule to find out how much money you would need to save to maintain a median U.S. income in retirement:\n$82,948/0.04 = $2,073,700\nThis means that the average American would need to save around $2.1 million for retirement to maintain the same standard of living.\nIt should be noted that some experts believe the 4% rule may not always be accurate, with different financial advisors recommending either riskier or more conservative strategies. Bill Bengen himself said that the 4% rule should be used as a guideline, not an ironclad rule.\nEvery individual will have different expenses and assets and will need to calculate their retirement requirements themselves. However, the 4% rule can be good for calculating a ballpark figure to start with. Before deciding on an amount for your retirement, it can be a good idea to talk to a financial advisor and consider your options.\nFind Out: If You Had Invested $10K in GameStop and AMC in 2021, Here\u2019s How Much You\u2019d Have Today\nAs of March 28, 2024, the current price of Microsoft\u2019s stock is $420.72. Ten years ago, at market close on March 28, 2014, Microsoft\u2019s stock was trading at $40.30 per share. This means that $10,000 invested in Microsoft in March 2014 would be worth $104,397.02 today.\nSo how much would you need to have invested in Microsoft 10 years ago to retire today? Let\u2019s take our previous estimate for the savings you would need to maintain the median U.S. income in retirement and compare it with the 10-year return for Microsoft\u2019s stock:\n\u00a0$40.30/$420.72 * $2,073,700 = $198,635.93\nThis means that if you had invested $198,635.02 in Microsoft stock in 2014, you would have enough in your retirement account to maintain the median American income for the next 30 years or so.\nWhile this can be an interesting thought experiment, investing all or most of your savings into a single company can be risky. There have been many companies that have lost a significant portion or all of their value within the past 10 years. Putting all of your money into a single business can mean losing out on potential growth from other investments or losing a significant portion of your savings. To be safe, many financial experts instead recommend investing in an index fund that tracks the growth of the whole market.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nSuze Orman: 5 Social Security Facts Every Soon-To-Be Retiree Must Know\nAvoid These 7 Cars That Will Only Last You Half as Long as the Average Vehicle\nThese 10 Aldi Brand Products Are Worth Every Penny\nThe Biggest Mistake People Make With Their Tax Refund -- And How to Avoid It\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much You Would Have Had To Invest In Microsoft 10 Years Ago To Retire Today\n"

And maybe if you could give us some hint on whether there's any truth to the potential of like $100 billion data center out there. A: Thank you, Keith, for the question. Let me start and Amy, you can add. At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are 2 sides to this, right? There is training and there's inference. What -- given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side. We want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\nQ: Satya, how would you characterize the demand environment? On one hand, you have bookings in Azure both accelerating year-over-year in the quarter, but we're seeing a lot of future concern, hesitation from other vendors we all cover. So I think everyone would love to get your sense of budget health for customers this year. A: Great question, Brent. There are a couple of things I would say. On the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very, very good about the -- we're fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective, at this point, Azure has become a port of call for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project.\nQ: Congratulations on the quarter and the guidance. I want to follow up on the AI obviously. We're seeing companies shifting their IT spending to invest in and learn about AI rather than receiving additional budgets for AI. At some point for AI to be transformative, as everyone expects, it needs to be accretive to spending. Satya, when do you believe AI will hit the maturity level? Will it be net increase to IT or outside of IT spending? And what would be the leading indicators of that maturation? And Amy, am I characterizing this correctly as it relates to Azure? Some projects are being delayed so that, that spending could be shifted to -- from core Azure toward Azure AI? A: Yes. Great set of questions, Mark. Let me just start by saying a good place to start is to watch what's happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right? I mean if you think about it, they bought tools in the past. Now you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you're spending today, right?\nQ: Satya and Amy, congrats on these outstanding Azure results. I'd love to hone in a little bit on the 7 point lift to Azure growth from AI, outstanding number, but it's leveling off a little bit from 6 points in December. I'm wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. To what extent did the capacity issues that you Amy highlighted on the call impact that number. Is there any seasonality? I wouldn't think so. Or any other factor that can swing around that number that you'd advise us to keep in mind? A: Thanks, Karl. There's not a seasonality to the numbers. So you're absolutely right to start there, and it's a good question. The way to think about it is a bit more by -- it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side in particular. And so that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that it is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and does impact a little bit the number in Q4.\nQ: I have more conceptual question for Satya. If you think about copilots and what you're doing there, you're kind of impacting a lot of this in businesses and the opportunities seem very broad-based. How do you think this will play out in the industry between you guys offering certain copilots versus like the rest of the industry following and everyone seems to have a copilot now and seems to be talking about it? How does that impact what you want to do, your partner strategy going forward? A: Yes, it's a great question. So the way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes, right? So it's not like -- when people do knowledge work, they're not doing knowledge work. They're doing knowledge work in support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service revenue ops, supply chain or what have you, right? So that's the first thing to note.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Russia is working to undermine US support for Ukraine ahead of the 2024 election, while Chinese influence campaigns aim to divide Americans and undercut their faith in democracy, according to new research from Microsoft Corp.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nRay Dalio\u2019s Famous Trade Is Sputtering, Investors Bailing\nTrump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial Underway\nZimbabwe\u2019s ZiG Wipes Out 330% Stocks Rally\nBillionaire Pinaults Fight to Pull Gucci Off the Discount Rack\nRussians Transform Dubai as They Flee Putin\u2019s War: Photo Essay\nBut both countries\u2019 persistent efforts to shape American politics through propaganda and cyberattacks have been less pronounced during this year\u2019s election cycle than they were in 2016 and 2020, the company said in a report published Wednesday. It also found that widespread fears of voters being influenced by deepfake videos made with artificial intelligence haven\u2019t yet happened, while simpler efforts have been more persuasive.\n\u201cChina has always adhered to non-interference in other countries\u2019 internal affairs,\u201d said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington. \u201cSpeculating or accusing China of using social media to interfere in the US politics is completely groundless and malicious speculation.\u201d\nA representative for the Russian Embassy in Washington didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nMicrosoft researchers found several \u201cRussia-affiliated\u201d efforts to push disinformation to hurt Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy or cause Americans to question their government\u2019s support for Ukraine as it continues to battle Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion. These campaigns have been conducted in English and Spanish, and they often take the form of purported whistleblowers or amateur journalists posting disinformation that is then covered by seemingly unaffiliated websites, the report states.\nMicrosoft found that the most prolific pushers of these narratives \u201care backed by or affiliated with\u201d the administration of Russian President Vladimir Putin and that the disinformation gets taken up by Americans who are likely unaware of its source. The company also said it\u2019s observed an uptick in recent months of a hacking group affiliated with the Russian military targeting Western policy think tanks.\nChina has made greater use of AI to create and enhance images, memes and videos meant to stoke controversy in the US and deepen existing social divisions, Microsoft found. For instance, social media accounts linked to China have pushed conspiratorial content, such as posts with AI-generated images of burning coastal roads that blame the US government for the summer 2023 wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui.\nThe researchers concluded that this sort of relatively simple digital forgery drew attention while there have been few signs of people being broadly swayed by sophisticated deepfake videos made with AI.\n\u201cRarely have nation-states\u2019 employments of generative AI-enabled content achieved much reach across social media, and in only a few cases have we seen any genuine audience deception from such content,\u201d the report states.\nIt also concluded that faked audio has been more effective as propaganda, as it\u2019s easier to make and harder to debunk than video.\nThis sort of deception caused alarm in January, when a doctored audio message of US President Joe Biden circulated discouraging voters in New Hampshire from casting ballots in the state\u2019s Democratic primary. In that case, the audio was traced back not to a foreign government but rather an American political operative.\n(Updates with comment from Chinese Embassy in third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets\nChina\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender\nRents Are the Fed\u2019s \u2018Biggest Stumbling Block\u2019 in Taming US Inflation\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 239%, thanks to unprecedented demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia continues to create value, and it's now worth $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft.\nThe trillion-dollar club is incredibly exclusive, with Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms being the only other members. However, another company might be poised to join the ranks within the next decade.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is an emerging challenger to Nvidia in the market for AI chips. The company is valued at just $270 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could see a gain of 270% if it does eventually join the trillion-dollar club. Here's why I think it will.\nLast year AMD unveiled its MI300 lineup of data center chips designed to process AI workloads. They come in two configurations: The MI300X is a pure GPU that competes with Nvidia's H100, and the MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to form an accelerated processing unit (APU).\nConsidering Nvidia can't keep up with demand for its chips, the door is open for competitors like AMD to snatch market share. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), AMD told investors it was working with tech giants like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta on MI300 GPU deployments for AI. Microsoft has already begun private previews with customers for the MI300X on its Azure cloud computing platform, where developers can access advanced AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\nAMD predicts the MI300 series could attract $3.5 billion in sales in 2024. That forecast was revised higher from $2 billion just three months earlier, which speaks to how quickly demand is building. Nvidia did $47.5 billion in data center revenue last fiscal year, driven mostly by its H100, so there is still plenty of room for AMD to grow.\nHowever, AMD's opportunity in AI transcends the data center. It already has a 90% market share in chips for AI-enabled personal computers, led by its Ryzen AI series, which includes CPUs, GPUs, and neural processing units (NPUs). The company says millions of AI PCs have already shipped with those chips, from manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and HP Inc.\nProcessing AI on-device results in a faster user experience, because workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center. That allows computers to host advanced virtual assistants capable of creating text content, images, and videos potentially without any network connection. Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year during Q4, and investors should watch for more rapid growth in the upcoming first quarter of 2024.\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, which means growth is sometimes lumpy from year to year. Consumers don't upgrade expensive products like computers and smartphones annually, which leads to an occasional lull in revenue growth for companies like AMD.\nFor example, AMD's revenue soared 44% in 2022 to $23.6 billion, but it came in at $22.7 billion in 2023, which was a 4% year-over-year decline. High inflation and rising interest rates didn't help, because they piled additional pressure on consumer spending.\nCommercial spending on the data center presents the same challenge. Tech giants like Microsoft normally don't upgrade their hardware every year; however, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will change that in the near term. He says $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure will be upgraded within four years to meet demand for accelerated computing and AI, which could drive a significant growth cycle for his company and the likes of AMD.\nWall Street analysts are forecasting $25.8 billion in 2024 revenue for AMD, which will represent growth of 14%. They also predict $32.5 billion in 2025 revenue, which would be an accelerated growth rate of 26%. However, considering AMD recently lifted its own forecast for MI300 sales by such a wide margin, combined with its soaring sales in AI-enabled computer chips, it's possible the company blows Wall Street's numbers out of the water.\nAfter all, Nvidia routinely beats expectations in the data center, and AMD's MI300 sales are only just starting to ramp up.\nAMD is currently valued at $270 billion, and based on its $22.7 billion in 2023 revenue, its stock trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. If that P/S ratio remains constant, AMD will have to generate $84 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation.\nThe company could get there within a decade if it grows revenue by a relatively modest 14% each year between now and 2034. AMD appears likely to meet the threshold comfortably in the near term based on the Street's forecasts for 2024 and 2025.\nPlus, despite the lumpiness in its yearly results, AMD's revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 15.6% over the last 10 years -- and that's without AI, which could be the company's largest opportunity ever.\nMultiple expansion is also a possibility. If AMD's revenue grows much faster than analysts expect, investors could be willing to pay a higher P/S ratio for the stock. Nvidia stock, for example, trades at a P/S ratio of 35.8 -- triple where AMD stock is trading. That would accelerate the company's path to a $1 trillion valuation.\nAMD is a very likely candidate to join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the trillion-dollar club, and investors who buy the stock today could earn a significant gain when it gets there.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nMany in the market are looking to this week's quarterly results from the four members of 'the Magnificent 7' to help reverse the stock market's ongoing weakness.\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be tied to the timing of Fed easing as a result of the evolving inflation picture rather than any deterioration in the overall earnings picture. If anything, the overall earnings picture has actually been improving ever so slightly in recent weeks, as we have been noting in our earnings commentary.\nThe hope appears to be that robust results from the Mag 7 companies reporting this week \u2013 Tesla on Tuesday, April 23rd, Meta Platforms on Wednesday, April 24th, Microsoft and Alphabet on Thursday, April 25th \u2013 will help restore confidence in the market's fundamental underpinnings and offset some of the Fed-centric worries.\nAs the above chart shows, Meta is in a league of its own, while Microsoft and Alphabet are roughly tracking each other.\nThis pecking order, with Meta at the top and Tesla at the bottom, remains unchanged when we begin tracking from October 27, 2023.\nThis divergence in performance reflects each stock's earnings outlook, with Meta enjoying the best and Tesla the worst.\nThe current Q1 Zacks Consensus EPS for Meta of $4.32 has increased +20% since late January 2024. On the other hand, Tesla's Q1 EPS estimate of $0.46 has been cut by more than -41% over the same period.\nTesla's woes are well known, ranging from a distracted leader to fundamental supply-demand forces for its core product. Meta is benefiting from an improving digital ad market and effective cost controls.\nQ1 estimates for Microsoft and Alphabet have barely moved higher, with both largely seen as leading the AI effort. It is unlikely that we will see any tangible developments from either of these two companies on their respective AI strategies, but we will nevertheless get more clarity about the coming periods.\nThe group is expected to bring in +33% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.7% higher revenues.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group jumped back into the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.4% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues.\nAs was the case with the 'Mag 7', the Tech sector as a whole dealt with the pulled-forward revenues during 2021 but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\nThis week, we enter the heart of the Q1 earnings season, with more than 500 companies reporting results, including 155 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-cap Tech players, we literally have a representative cross-section of the market on deck to report results this week.\nThrough Friday, April 19th, we have seen Q1 results from 71 S&P 500 index members. Total Q1 earnings for these 71 index members are up +9.4% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 77.5% beating EPS estimates and 63.4% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.7% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Expectations are Moving Higher \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Echo Wang ",
        "Text": "By Echo Wang\nNEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Rubrik, the cybersecurity software startup that counts Microsoft among its investors, priced its initial public offering at $32 per share on Wednesday above its indicated price range, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nRubrik upsized its IPO to raise $752 million after selling 23.5 million shares, the source said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential. It infers a valuation of $5.6 billion on Palo Alto, California-based Rubrik.\nRubrik did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRubrik's plans to go public come as the U.S. IPO market is showing early signs of a rebound after stock market launches froze up during most of 2022 and 2023.\nFollowing the successful stock market flotations of social media platform Reddit and semiconductor connectivity firm Astera Labs, several companies including Cato Networks and Synechron have kicked off preparations to go public.\nFounded in 2014 by venture capitalist Bipul Sinha, Rubrik makes cloud-based ransomware protection and data-backup software. The company serves more than 6,000 business customers, including Nvidia and Home Depot.\nRubrik's subscription annual recurring revenue, which measures customers' full contract values, grew 47% at the end of January, compared to a year earlier, according to its IPO filing. It also disclosed a loss of $354 million on revenue of $628 million for the 12 months ended Jan. 31, compared with a loss of $278 million on revenue of $600 million a year earlier.\nRubrik will list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"RBRK\" on Thursday. Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are the lead underwriters for the offering. (Reporting by Echo Wang in New York; Editing by Anirban Sen and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

The company also added 500,000 shares to the IPO late Wednesday, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAt the IPO price, Rubrik would has a market value of about $5.6 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. Including stock options and restricted share units, the company\u2019s fully diluted valuation of more than $6.6 billion.\nRubrik\u2019s offering had received about 20 times as many orders as there were shares available and the company was considering selling them for as much as $34 apiece, Bloomberg News reported earlier.\nRubrik, which secures its corporate customers\u2019 data across enterprise, cloud and software-as-a-service applications, is only the second sizable US IPO by an enterprise software startup in the past two years. Shopify Inc.-backed marketing and data automation provider Klaviyo Inc. ended the drought in September with a $659 million offering.\nAI Wave\nThe company is riding a wave of technology IPOs in 2024. They include Reddit Inc., semiconductor equipment maker Astera Labs Inc. and software marketing firm Ibotta Inc., which made its public debut last week.\nSurging demand for exposure to the AI boom has spurred optimism for tech firms such as Reddit whose touting of revenue from licensing data for AI model training helped make its $860 million IPO a success. AI has also prompted industry giants like Salesforce Inc. to bet on a new cycle of tech investment. That could benefit companies like Rubrik, which hasn\u2019t turned a profit yet, after contract spending in the software sector has declined.\nRead More: SAP Rises Most Since January on Record Cloud Backlog Growth\nRubrik was founded in 2013 and released its first product in 2016. It said it now has more than 6,100 customers, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc. Its clients include governments and universities, as well as an array of companies such as Home Depot Inc., PepsiCo Inc., Illumina Inc., Fiserv Inc. and the National Football League\u2019s Denver Broncos.\nMicrosoft Stake\nMicrosoft made an equity investment in Rubrik in 2021 in a financing round that valued the startup at $4 billion, Bloomberg News reported. Rubrik, whose backers also include Bain Capital Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Greylock Partners and Khosla Ventures, has raised $1.18 billion to date, according to data provider PitchBook.\nRubrik Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Bipul Sinha, who is also one of the company\u2019s co-founders, currently owns 7.6% of the Class B shares. Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Arvind Nithrakashyap owns a 6.7% stake. Those shares will have 20 votes each, compared with one each for the Class A shares sold in the IPO.\nThrough its alliance with Microsoft, Rubrik has committed to spend $220 million over the course of up to 10 years for the use of Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platform. Rubrik will use Azure for its data security solutions and preferentially offer public cloud functionality for Azure to its customers, according to its filings.\nRubrik recorded a $354 million in net loss in the year ended January 31, and $24.5 million in negative free cash flow, despite growing its subscription annual recurring revenue by 47%, according to its filings.\nIPO Rebound\nOne advantage Rubrik may be able to count on is that the buoyant market for IPOs may help with sentiment. Debuting in 2023\u2019s uncertain environment for new listings, Klaviyo has spent much of its time as a public company below its offer price. By contrast, Rubrik is set to begin trading amid a broad rebound in the US IPO market.\nSince the beginning of the year, companies have raised more than $12.2 billion on US exchanges, more than twice as much as in the same period in 2023, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Two dozen offerings over $100 million were completed this year, spanning sectors from sporting goods to safety testing.\nRubrik\u2019s offering is being led by Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citigroup and Wells Fargo & Co. The company\u2019s shares are expected to begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RBRK.\n--With assistance from Ryan Gould.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy\nTesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes\nBiden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts\nCaught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides\nHow to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

They have been out in the workforce for several years and many of them are now investing in stocks. This generation also came of age with financial apps like Robinhood on their phones already. They have embraced fintech.\nNo one would be surprised to know that GenZ investors like technology and don't like some of the old economy industries like fossil fuels. Tracey also hasn't heard about them rushing into the bank stocks either.\nBut clean energy, especially nuclear, appears to be high on their list. And big tech, especially the Mag 7, even if those companies have been around for many decades, are also in the picture.\nSome stocks, like Tesla, which were popular with Millennials, appear to be out-of-favor with younger investors. Perhaps Rivian is more their steam?\nEvery generation also comes of age amidst a new restaurant brand. Baby Boomers had McDonald's. GenX had Starbucks. Millennials had Chipotle. What will it be for GenZ?\n1. Microsoft Corp. MSFT\nMicrosoft went IPO in 1986, well before GenZ was even born. It isn't exactly a \"new\" technology company. But it has its hands in many areas, including generative AI thanks to its investment in OpenAI.\nShares of Microsoft are up 7.8% year-to-date after pulling back from recent all-time highs. GenZ likes companies that pay dividends, and Microsoft pays one, currently yielding 0.7%.\nAre you surprised GenZers are interested in owning Microsoft?\n2. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\nNVIDIA is the leader in AI chips in 2024 but prior to AI, it was the leader in gaming. Is it any surprise, then, that GenZ wants to own NVIDIA?\nShares of NVIDIA are up 70.7% year-to-date but have pulled back off their all-time highs over the last month, falling 3.8% in that period. NVIDIA also pays a dividend, currently yielding just 0.02%. It's just $0.16 a share so investors aren't really owning it for the yield.\nNVIDIA may seem expensive, but it's trading at just 35x forward earnings.\nIs NVIDIA a \"generational\" must-own stock for GenZ?\n3. Sweetgreen, Inc. SG\nSweetgreen is a fast-growing restaurant chain that is popular with GenZ and Millennial consumers as it serves healthy food. Sweetgreen shares have taken off in 2024, rising 84% year-to-date. But over the last month, shares have pulled back by 6.3%.\nSweetgreen is still a small cap company, with a market cap of just $2.4 billion.\nWill Sweetgreen be GenZ's generational restaurant chain, like McDonald's was for the Baby Boomers?\n4. Constellation Energy Corp. CEG\nConstellation Energy is a leading provider of nuclear energy in the United States. It has a market cap of $58.4 billion. GenZ is very interested in clean energy companies. Additionally, Constellation Energy pays a dividend, which GenZ loves. It's currently yielding 0.8%.\nShares of Constellation Energy are up 57% year-to-date. It still has an attractive PEG ratio, however, of 0.9. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has both growth and value.\nShould Constellation Energy be on your short list?\n5. Rivian Automotive, Inc. RIVN\nRivian manufactures electric vehicles. GenZ has come of age with EVs like Tesla being commonplace. Why not invest in it?\nShares of Rivian have plunged this year as sales of EV cars and trucks have slowed. Rivian recently announced another round of layoffs. Shares are down 62.3% year-to-date. But earnings are still expected to rise 19.3% this year.\nIs this a buying opportunity in Rivian?\nWhat Else Should You Know About GenZ's Favorite Stocks? \nTune into this week's video podcast to find out.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The Crowdbotics platform helps customers get the most out of the code they\u2019ve already written and helps them avoid reinventing the wheel. The platform utilizes AI to accelerate each step of the development lifecycle, starting with improving the product requirements documentation (PRD) process and delivering benefits all the way through to deployment. By delivering on the promise of systematic code reuse, the Crowdbotics platform accelerates time to value and reduces risk for enterprise application development.\n\"Microsoft has built a reputation for working with companies that demonstrate the ability to develop new and unique use cases for AI, and this collaboration helps validate the power of our CodeOps platform,\" said Anand Kulkarni, founder and CEO, Crowdbotics. \"This relationship, combined with the general availability of our flagship CodeOps platform, gives organizations access to the tools they need to speed up app development so they can focus on other areas of innovation.\"\n\"Collaborating with Crowdbotics allows us to give customers more options for developing applications while saving time and resources,\" said Gustavo Blum, General Manager, Global Partner Solutions, Microsoft. \"Microsoft Azure and our investments in AI, combined with Crowdbotics' methodology for systematic code reuse, provides customers with a new, powerful set of tools for delivering digital transformation and building the apps that move the needle.\"\nAs a result of the collaboration, customers will have the best of both worlds with access to Microsoft and Crowdbotics\u2019 complementary uses of AI to streamline app development.\nThe Crowdbotics CodeOps PlatformNow generally available, the Crowdbotics CodeOps platform is built around the fact that, on average, up to 70% of the code required for a given project has already been written. Development with the Crowdbotics CodeOps platform includes four key steps:\nPlanning. Uses AI to improve the quality of the requirements definition process with high-quality Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that take infrastructure, standards and policies into account.\nMatching. Sophisticated AI matches each requirement detail for the application captured in the PRD with existing code maintained in a centralized module catalog.\nAssembly. Using the modules identified in the matching process, the platform utilizes AI to assemble them into a nearly complete app.\nDeployment. Developers fill in any remaining gaps, focusing on the most unique and valuable features.\nThe Crowdbotics CodeOps platform frees organizations from using generative AI to reinvent the wheel, instead tapping into its power to facilitate faster and more innovative app development.\nTo learn more about the Crowdbotics CodeOps platform, connect with Crowdbotics:\nLinkedIn\nBlog\nCrowdbotics platform for CodeOps\nAbout Crowdbotics Crowdbotics helps enterprise customers deliver applications faster using strategic code reuse and generative AI.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$429 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$389. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$409 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Microsoft\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nAccording to our valuation model, Microsoft seems to be fairly priced at around 11% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $457.55, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 51% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MSFT\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on MSFT, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIf you want to dive deeper into Microsoft, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Microsoft you should know about.\nIf you are no longer interested in Microsoft, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Tesla TSLA.\nWe have Apple and Amazon on deck to report Q1 results this week, and we will need to wait a few more weeks before we see Nvidia\u2019s numbers. But we have already seen Q1 results from the other four members of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group: Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Tesla.\nIt is hard to find any weakness in the Microsoft and Alphabet reports, and the market\u2019s reaction to these two reports shows that investors agree with that assessment. The Alphabet report appears to reassure investors that it has a credible AI strategy in place and may not be that far behind Microsoft in this critical race.\nThe market reaction to the Tesla and Meta reports needs to be contextualized.\nMeta shares were very strong performers prior to this report, and any way you look at the company\u2019s Q1 results, they are impressive. Meta\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +80.5% from the year-earlier period on +27.3% higher revenues. Investors\u2019 beef with the Meta report is the company\u2019s guidance for capital expenditures, which is going up significantly to strengthen the company\u2019s AI capabilities.\nI think the reaction is overdone, but it likely reminds investors of the pain created by the company\u2019s earlier metaverse plans. Perhaps there is a basis for those worries, given the metaverse history. But as we are seeing with Microsoft and Alphabet, leadership in AI requires a lot of spending. If market participants are okay with Microsoft and Alphabet spending hands-over-fist on AI, then they should also be okay with Meta.\nTesla shares have been the worst performing of the group, with many starting to speak out that perhaps it didn\u2019t deserve to be part of this group. The stock price weakness reflects the steadily deteriorating earnings outlook, with a combination of softening demand and heightened competitive pressures forcing Elon Musk to cut prices.\nGiven this stock\u2019s price action and estimates revision trajectory coming into the quarterly release, investors were conditioned to expect the worst from Tesla, but the actual results were simply bad (instead of \u2018very bad\u2019). They missed on the top- and bottom lines and didn\u2019t provide any favorable or reassuring commentary about the outlook. But investors were relieved that the numbers weren\u2019t as ugly as they had started fearing.\nTesla shares are still laggards relative to other Mag 7 stocks.\nUsing estimates for Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia, which will release their March-quarter results on April 30th, May 2nd, and May 22nd, respectively, and actual results for the other four members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +43.7% from the same period last year on +13.2% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.1% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 20.6% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 21.6% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven the group's enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with its market leadership.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +27.1% from the same period last year on +8.7% higher revenues.\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 950 companies reporting results, including 177 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Apple and Amazon reports, we literally have a representative cross-section of the market on deck to report results this week.\nThrough Friday, April 26th, we have seen Q1 results from 229 S&P 500 index members, or 45.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 229 index members are up +2.8% from the same period last year on +3.3% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 59.8% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +3.7% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.3% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.3% on +1.7% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Breaking Down Q1 Earnings Results \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 11, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA, Super Micro Computer SMCI, and Arm Holdings ARM.\nOn Wall Street, innovation leads to earnings growth, and earnings growth which eventually leads to higher equity prices. In late 2022, OpenAI, which counts tech behemoth Microsoft as its largest investor, sparked the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution with the release of its \"chatbot\" ChatGPT. ChatGPT, which leverages a large language model (LLM), allows users to get answers to almost any question in the world instantly.\nThough artificial intelligence has been around for decades, ChatGPT was the first proof of concept, becoming the fastest consumer app to reach the milestone of 100 million users and sparking other tech companies like Alphabet to rush in and enter the AI fray.\nUndoubtedly, investors have enjoyed a bull market over the past year, as evidenced by rising equities and a breakout to new highs, strong earnings, and broad-based participation. Like most bull markets, the stocks with the most robust growth are the ones that lead. In this market, artificial intelligence-related stocks are clearly the industry leading the way. In a recent podcast, Elon Musk said, \"AI is the fastest advancing technology I've seen of any kind, and I've seen a lot of technology.\" Though I am far from a technologist, I have been around Wall Street for multiple decades, and I, too, have not witnessed this type of earnings growth.\nAfter a tremendous move, AI-related names such as Nvidia,Super Micro Computer, Arm Holdings are finally retreating as inflation worries spook U.S. investors after a hotter-than-expected CPI reading.\nWhether you caught or missed the move in AI-related stocks, now is the time to revisit them. Below are three important reasons why, including:\nAs I have said before, institutional investors tend to defend the intermediate-term 10-week moving average in bull markets, and the area historically provides a fantastic reward-to-risk ratio for investors. For example, shares of NVDA, which trended from $500 in January to nearly $1,000 per share, are retreating uniformly to their 10-week moving average.\nAs the race to AI dominance intensifies, Wall Street sees earnings growth in several AI-related names gaining momentum. For instance, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that Super Micro Computer will grow quarterly earnings by triple digits over the next two quarters, which is not too shabby for a $50 billion company.\nA lack of selling after a monstrous gain is a simple yet effective signal that bulls are not rushing to part with shares. ARM shares exploded 62% after reporting monstrous earnings in February. Since then, shares have digested those gains and have held the earnings gains entirely \u2013 a sign that bulls are in control.\nAmateur investors often hope for a pullback but never pull the trigger when it occurs. That said, a pullback in AI stocks may offer a juicy reward-to-risk zone to take advantage of.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

These are the ETFs which track the performance of the S&P 500 index.\nBuying the indexes has become a popular way to invest for many, with it even being endorsed by the greatest living investor, Warren Buffett.\nBut which S&P 500 ETF do you buy?\nTracey and Neena cut through all the noise to bring you the basics.\nOne of the biggest contributing factors as to which S&P 500 ETF you will buy is the expense ratio. You may not think it matters whether an ETF charges you 0.09% or 0.02%, but over 20 or 30 years, those little amounts really add up and can hit your performance.\nThe lower the expense ratio, the better. And thankfully, ETF providers have been in a competition to find out which provider could provide the cheapest index ETFs so the expense ratios keep going lower.\n1. SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF is the oldest of the S&P 500 index ETFs and it's the largest, in terms of assets.\nBut SPY is also the most expensive. It has an expense ratio of 0.095%. Because of its liquidity, SPY has been favored by traders, and less by investors.\nIf you are a long-term investor, you should consider investing in one of the cheaper indexes.\n2. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is so popular with investors that most just refer to it by its ticker: the VOO.\nFor years, VOO was the cheapest of the big S&P 500 ETFs. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%.\nThe VOO is often offered in many 401ks and many investors buy it for their own IRA accounts.\nBut VOO no longer the \"cheapest\" of the ETFs. Should you still buy it?\n3. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG\nThe SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF is a newer ETF with just a few years on the market. State Street saw that it's flagship SPY was losing some steam with long term investors who wanted a lower expense ratio, so it created SPLG.\nSPLG tracks the same index as the others but it has an even lower expense ratio of just 0.02%. If you are a long-term investor looking for the cheapest way to buy and hold the S&P 500, then SPLG should be on your short list.\nAll 3 ETFs Hold the Same Top Stocks\n1. Microsoft Corp. MSFT\nBecause all three are tracking the same S&P 500 index, they all own the same top 10 stocks. Microsoft is the largest holding in the market cap S&P 500 index. Microsoft is 7.09% of the index.\nMicrosoft has been on a tear, rising 42.6% in the last year. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has gained 22.7% during that time.\nIf you own the S&P 500, you will own a position in Microsoft.\n2. Apple Inc. AAPL\nApple is the second largest position in the S&P 500, at 5.64%. But instead of being a boost to the index this year, it has held it back.\nApple shares are up only 1.1% over the last year, underperforming the S&P 500 index, which has gained 22.7% during that time.\nThis underperformance is why investors like to own indexes. They get a bucket of stocks that can help smooth out rough times in a single position.\nMany investors like owning the S&P 500 index because of this big concentration in Apple.\nWhat Else Should You Know About the Best S&P 500 ETFs? \nTune into this week's video podcast to find out.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nFollow us on Twitter:\u00a0 https://twitter.com/zacksresearch\nJoin us on Facebook:\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com/performance\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Microsoft Corp: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-04-01, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $292.58. It's currently trading at a price of $420.72. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -43.8%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.07\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.21%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 17.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n153.46\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n139.12\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n292.58\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $175.45. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -139.79%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) investors will be pleased with their solid 247% return over the last five years",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up an impressive 231% over the last five years. The last week saw the share price soften some 2.7%.\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Microsoft achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 21% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 27% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Microsoft, it has a TSR of 247% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nIt's good to see that Microsoft has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 45% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 28% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Microsoft is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Stock market today: Alphabet and Microsoft help Wall Street clinch its best week in nearly 6 months",
        "Author": "  STAN CHOE ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The best week for U.S. stocks since November closed out with more gains thanks to Alphabet and Microsoft on Friday.\nThe S&P 500 rallied 1% to finish its first winning week in the last four. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 153 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 2%.\nAlphabet leaped 10.2% after breezing past analysts\u2019 expectations for profit last quarter. The parent company of Google also said it will start paying a dividend to investors and authorized a program to buy back up to $70 billion of its stock, a signal of how much cash it's generating.\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, climbed 1.8% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. It cited strong growth in its cloud-computing business as it pushes artificial-intelligence technology to its customers.\nThey helped offset a 9.2% drop for Intel. It reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected, but its revenue fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates. So did its forecast for profit in the current quarter.\nStocks have broadly been under pressure this month after hopes withered for multiple cuts to interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve. A series of reports this year showing inflation remaining worse than forecast has traders expecting maybe one cut this year, down from forecasts for six or more at the start of the year.\nYet another report on Friday showed inflation remaining stubbornly high. This time it was the measure of prices for March that the Federal Reserve prefers to use, but it wasn\u2019t much worse than forecasts. Financial markets took it much more in stride than a report from the day before that suggested the same measure of inflation rose quickly from January through March.\nTreasury yields largely eased in the bond market following Friday morning's report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.66% from 4.71% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, held steadier. It edged down to 4.99% from 5.00%.\nWhile inflation has remained hotter than forecast, EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco expects it to cool in coming months as shoppers pressured in part by slowing growth in wages tamp down their purchases, which is the fuel that gives inflation energy.\n\u201cConsumers remain willing to spend, but not on anything, nor at any price,\u201d he said.\nEconomists also said the weaker-than-expected reading on the overall U.S. economy from Thursday, which helped send stocks sliding, may not be as bad as it seemed on the surface.\n\u201cThe economy remains on solid footing,\u201d Bank of America economists said in a report, pointing to solid buying trends from U.S. customers. Such an interpretation calms worries that the U.S. economy could be heading for a toxic mix of stagnating growth and high inflation, something that the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t have great tools to fix.\nStill, the higher-than-expected inflation readings will likely keep the Fed on hold at its next policy meeting on Wednesday. Its main interest rate has been sitting at the highest level since 2001 in hopes of undercutting inflation by putting downward pressure on the economy and financial markets.\nAfter earlier indicating that three cuts to interest rates could be on the way this year, top Fed officials have since said they could hold its main interest rate high for a while to ensure inflation heads down toward their 2% target.\nFriday's report on sticky inflation \u201cunderscores Vanguard\u2019s belief that the Federal Reserve may find it\u2019s unable to cut interest rates this year,\u201d according to the investment giant's global head of portfolio construction, Roger Aliaga-Diaz.\nIf interest rates stay high, companies will need to produce stronger profits for their stock prices to rise. So far this reporting season, the trend has been better than expected.\nRoughly three out of four companies have been topping analysts' forecasts for profit, according to FactSet. That includes ResMed, which reported healthier profit and revenue than expected late Thursday. Its stock jumped 18.9% for Friday's biggest gain in the S&P 500.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 51.54 points to 5,099.96. The Dow added 153.86 to 38,239.66, and the Nasdaq gained 316.14 to 15,927.90.\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.8% after the Bank of Japan ended a policy meeting with no major changes to interest rates. Indexes also rose across much of the rest of Asia and Europe.\n___\nAP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.\n"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Micron Technology Inc. MU, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\nU.S. stock markets witnessed an impressive first quarter of 2024 after an astonishing 2023. Wall Street\u2019s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.\nU.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.\nThe core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) \u2014 Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge \u2014 rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank\u2019s expectations.\nPeak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure \u2014 the largest driver of the GDP \u2014 increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.\nThe first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.\nThis follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.\nOn Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.\nHowever, the Fed\u2019s latest \u201cdot-plot\u201d (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\nDespite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNVIDIA Corp.\u2019s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA\u2019s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\nMETA\u2019s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. The stock price of META has climbed 37.2% year to date.\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU\u2019s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU\u2019s memory and storage.\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.\nMicrosoft Corp. is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT\u2019s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\nContinued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 60 days. The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.\nAmazon.com Inc. has benefited from Prime and AWS\u2019 momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN\u2019s robust advertising business has contributed as well.\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AMZN has surged 18.8% year to date.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Mar\u00eda Soledad Davila Calero ",
        "Text": "Continuing a run of tech IPOs, Rubrik, according to a fresh SEC filing, will be seeking as much as $713 million when the company goes public via the NYSE later this month under the ticker RBRK.\nAlong with Astera Labs and Reddit, Rubrik is one of the major tech firms many investors have been hoping would IPO this year, ending a two-year drought of public offerings. Additionally, Rubrik is a traditional SaaS (software as a service) company and will serve as a better comparison for other tech companies evaluating whether to go public in 2024, explained Phil Haslett, cofounder and chief strategy officer for EquityZen, a secondary marketplace for companies in the private market.\nBecause Rubrik has positive financial indicators\u2014$784 million in revenue and 40% growth in positive cash flow\u2014Haslett noted, if its IPO doesn\u2019t do well it could create a chilling effect.\n\u201cIf this IPO happened, like, four or five years ago, people would be talking about how Rubrik was a really big company from a revenue perspective and a success story,\u201d added Haslett, who asked whether the standards for going public have changed significantly. \u201cBecause if so, then we have to kind of take a look at who's really eligible to be a public company, or who's going to be able to be a public company.\u201d\nAccording to Rubrik\u2019s amended S-1, the company will be making available 23 million shares\u2014out of a total of 175,433,785\u2014priced from $28 to $31. Using a midpoint price of $29.50, the offering would generate $632.6 million, but at the higher end it would produce $713 million\u2014and an implied valuation of more than $5.4 billion.\nSuch a sum would be at least $1.4 billion more than what Rubrik was valued at after a 2021 funding round led by Microsoft. Rubrik was founded in 2011, with a focus on cloud-based data protection, and later entered into a partnership with Microsoft to build cybersecurity protection for its cloud service, Azure.\nThe top underwriter for Rubrik\u2019s IPO is Goldman Sachs, followed by Barclays, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and 11 other institutions. The listing is scheduled for April 25, just a week after Ibotta, another tech firm whose IPO has garnered attention from investors, is set to make its debut on the Nasdaq.\nGiven how Rubrik\u2019s shares have been moving in the secondary market, Haslett added, its pricing range seems on par with what\u2019s been seen at EquityZen in the lead-up to the IPO. Although he expects retail investors to pay less attention to the offering than to one for a household name like Reddit, Haslett still thinks interest on the institutional side could push shares skyward once trading begins.\n\u201cIf everybody's hitting the buy button, then things are going to go up at a higher velocity, like Reddit, but the opposite can also be true,\u201d he added. \u201cThe retail awareness helps for the first six months. I think it matters less over time.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "Hindsight suggests that betting against JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon isn't the smartest idea\u2014especially when it comes to banking. But nearly two decades ago, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates suggested it might be time to start \"bypassing\" these financial institutions\u2014and Dimon hasn't forgotten.\nIn the mid-1990s Gates\u2014now a billionaire worth $149 billion per Bloomberg's Billionaire's Index\u2014didn't appear to hold banks in especially high esteem. \nHe reportedly said banks were \"dinosaurs\" that could be bypassed, and added that while \"banking is necessary, banks are not.\"\nSuch statements caught the attention of Dimon, now also a billionaire himself, who said he confronted the Big Tech founder in the late 1990s.\nDimon \"remembered\" Gates's criticism of the industry and called him out on it a number of years later, he told Bloomberg's Emily Chang on her podcast 'The Circuit.'\n\"I spoke to him about it in 1997,\" Dimon said. \"Obviously he was dead wrong\u2014he'd probably agree with that.\"\nBut the 68-year-old Harvard alumni agreed with Gates on the wider point that \"technology changes everything\"\u2014even if that hadn't meant banks becoming redundant.\n\"If anyone is complacent or arrogant or thinks that because you have a big position today you're going to have a big position tomorrow, that's a mistake,\" Dimon said.\nBut while technologies like artificial intelligence may displace some human roles in the finance sector, Dimon said there will always be a need for banking in some shape or form.\n\"What is banking?\" Dimon asked. \"Someone's going to have to hold the money. Someone's going to have to move the money. Someone's going to have to raise the money. Someone's going to have to do research around money.\n\"Those services will still be around and hopefully we're doing it and using a lot of tech to do a better job at it.\"\nAccording to one index at least, JPMorgan is certainly doing a better job than its peers when it comes to integrating tech like artificial intelligence with day-to-day operations.\nBenchmarking platform Evident Insights assesses how ready businesses are for the incoming wave of transformation that AI will bring, and the platform's co-founder and CEO Alexandra Mousavizadeh says that Dimon's firm is leading the pack.\nBanks like JPMorgan Chase, and other North American institutions, are now so far ahead of their peers it\u2019s now a question of \u201ccan one catch up,\u201d Mousavizadeh told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference held in London this week.\nAnd while Dimon's team of more than 240,000 employees may be leading the way for their peers, there's also a new player entering the financial playing field: Big Tech.\nWhile Apple's recent foray into consumer banking with Goldman Sachs is reportedly coming to a close, Dimon is keeping a close eye on such activities.\nThe CEO, who was paid $36 million for his work in 2023, said Apple's move into finance isn't currently an \"existential threat\" to JPMorgan, but added: \"If we were complacent about it, yes.\"\nThe self-professed\u00a0\u201cfull-throated, red-blooded, patriotic, unwoke, capitalist CEO\u201d also made it clear he wouldn't make it easy for emerging competitors to gain any of JPMorgan's market share.\nHe said: \"We're going to compete, so they have a tough competitor but they hold money, move money\u2014yeah, they're a form of a competitor. We also partner with them but I'm very used to partnering and competing with lots of people.\"\nThe Queens native added Apple has the \"right\" to launch their own financial products, but said he \"would be against the unfair use of their position to dominate us a in a business.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Sabina Wex ",
        "Text": "You may not think you have anything in common with the 29-year-old stand-up comedian son of a billionaire, but it turns out Pete Ballmer may have a few tips for all of us when it comes to money and relationships.\nBallmer is the son of Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft and current owner of the L.A. Clippers basketball team. In a conversation with Business Insider, he shared how his father\u2019s $121 billion net worth has impacted his romantic relationships.\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nCost-of-living in America is still out of control \u2014 use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\u201cI can tell when some people consider me only as an asset, someone it'd be good to stay connected with,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cI feel like there have been enough times where it's like a sixth sense by now.\u201d\nYou may not have Ballmer\u2019s bank account, but his experience does speak to some universal truths about the insidious ways money can ruin relationships.\nThe topic of money \u2014 especially the specifics of his father\u2019s great wealth \u2014 generally left him feeling uneasy.\n\u201cI was deeply uncomfortable with all of this for the longest time,\u201d Ballmer told the hosts of the Cash Cuties podcast.\nAnd so Ballmer struggled making friends growing up, as he never knew if people were more attracted to his wealth than him. Romantic relationships, surprisingly, came easier for him.\nDating apps are relatively anonymous, only requiring a first name and some pictures, which allowed Ballmer to date without the baggage of his last name.\nEventually, after the second or third date and he\u2019d had a chance to get a feel for the person and sense that they weren\u2019t materialistic, Ballmer would spill the beans about his family and their wealth.\nEven when you don\u2019t come from great wealth, having these money talks early on in a relationship is important. And it\u2019s important to remember your formative childhood experiences with money often determine your attitude toward it in adulthood.\nFor instance, a University of Pittsburgh researcher discovered that teens often have behavioral and mental health issues when their parents struggle with money. If you\u2019re someone who grew up in a financially unstable home, then you may still get stressed out around money because of how you grew up around it. It may even trigger old teenage behaviors and mental health issues. Your partner may not understand why you get moody when the monthly credit card bill comes.\nThis is why Kathleen Burns Kingsbury, a wealth psychology expert, told CNBC that couples need to take each other through their own \u201cmoney island,\u201d explaining how they think about money, what they learned about it as a kid and what makes sense to them.\nRead more: Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe \u2014 you may want to do the same in 2024\nBallmer has been dating the same woman for almost two years and lives with her in a two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. They split everything evenly and haven\u2019t merged their finances yet.\n\u201cIf I were dating someone who proposed proportional spending, I would feel a little miffed and feel that perhaps they saw part of the deal with dating me as a benefit to their lifestyle,\u201d he told Business Insider.\nBut many couples don\u2019t want to split their bills 50/50. A 2023 survey from Thriving Center of Psychology discovered that half of cohabitating couples don\u2019t split their mortgage or rent equally.\nHowever, just 37% of the Thriving survey respondents say their relationship is \u201cfinancially unequal.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s often a difference in these situations between aiming for a division of expenses that\u2019s equal and one that\u2019s fair.\nRegardless of what anyone else might think, you and your partner need to figure out a division you can both be happy with. Bread Financial discovered in a recent survey that 41% of people wish they shared a more similar financial mindset with their partner.\nDifferences in financial attitudes can lead to issues down the line, like \u201cfinancial infidelity,\u201d where one person in the relationship chooses to hide purchases or debts from their partner. Financial infidelity is so common that almost half of respondents in the Bread Financial survey admitted to it. This kind of lying may seem harmless, but it can lead to breakups or even identity theft issues in extreme cases.\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month\nJeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jamie Dimon are selling out of US stocks in a big way \u2014 here's how to diversify into private real estate within minutes\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs \u2014 take advantage today\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-04-29, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $305.52. It's currently trading at a price of $406.32. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -32.99%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.56\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.63%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 17.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n160.25\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n145.28\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n305.52\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $183.55. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -121.37%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(NASDAQ: DBX) announced new security, organization, and sharing features to give teams the control, flexibility, and speed to get work done from anywhere. In the modern workplace, teams are spread across locations, time zones, and even different companies, so having tools that make teamwork effortless has never been more important. Using the lessons learned from Virtual First\u2014the Dropbox playbook for distributed work\u2014these tools are designed to help teams get work done quickly and seamlessly, all from Dropbox.\n\"Our latest product updates aim to empower teams to cut through the clutter so they can do more focused, meaningful work,\" said Drew Houston, Dropbox co-founder and CEO. \"As teams become more distributed, Dropbox continues to be the trusted, easy-to-use platform for them to organize their content and collaborate\u2014anytime and anywhere. And with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning, we have the potential to automate routine tasks, increase productivity, and free up mental space so people can get back to doing the work that matters most. I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019re building for an AI-first future, and we\u2019re just getting started.\"\nAdvanced data protection features add extra layers of security to confidential content with seamless end-to-end encryption and advanced key management\nFor years, Dropbox has been trusted by hundreds of millions of users to keep their most important content secure in a simple, seamless way that doesn\u2019t require custom configuration or complex steps. All customer files at rest are encrypted using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standards so Dropbox users can be confident their data is secure. Some teams, however, work with more sensitive information and want customized encryption standards or additional layers of security to control their data and permissions. So today, Dropbox is adding even more advanced data protection features, designed to be easy-to-use for all business teams. In addition to existing layers of security for all Dropbox accounts, business teams will now have access to:\nSeamless end-to-end encryption: Safeguards data so only the sender and recipient can access content, which means that no one\u2014not even Dropbox\u2014can get into those files. Seamless end-to-end encryption is now natively integrated into team folders and eliminates the need for additional software subscriptions.\nAdvanced key management: Lets customers set up a unique encryption key managed by FIPS 140-2 Level 3 key management services, providing better protection and management of all team Dropbox files.\nDropbox is also introducing additional security features and updates:\nAn improved admin experience helps customers monitor membership, configure add-ons, and customize AI usage to manage content privacy and security.\nAn updated Trust Center simplifies risk assessments of Dropbox products in one place, making it easy to complete internal reviews and access information about security, reliability, privacy, and compliance.\nThe latest security features will be available to all Dropbox Advanced, Business Plus, and Enterprise customers starting today. To learn more, visit https://www.dropbox.com/product-updates.\nStay organized with new Dropbox integrations with Microsoft 365 and say goodbye to conflicting copies\nCustomers want tools that meet them where they are working, and it should be seamless to bring the tools they use most into Dropbox products. That\u2019s why the company recently launched an improved integration with Microsoft Teams that lets customers search, preview, upload, and share content stored in Dropbox without leaving Microsoft 365. With this update, customers can also use Dropbox\u2019s plugin extension for Copilot for Microsoft 365 to answer questions and generate summaries.\nToday, Dropbox is building on this with even more Microsoft integrations designed to simplify work for customers.\nReal-Time Co-Authoring (beta): One of Dropbox\u2019s most-requested features ever, Co-Authoring allows multiple team members to collaboratively edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files from desktop, web, and mobile, natively within Dropbox. Users can also see who\u2019s in the document and where they\u2019re editing in real time, so everyone is working off the latest version. Now teams can finally put an end to conflicting copies.\nDropbox Replay for OneDrive: Bring media files from OneDrive directly into Dropbox Replay for reviews and approvals.\n\"It is important that mutual customers collaborate in the most seamless way possible,\" said Harshal Patil, Senior Product Manager at Microsoft. \"The Cloud Storage Partner Program offers partners like Dropbox the ability to integrate with our solutions. With this integration, users now have a more seamless way to collaborate on documents stored in Microsoft 365 or Dropbox, thereby addressing evolving customer needs.\"\nStarting today, all Dropbox customers can sign up for the Co-Authoring beta and access the Dropbox Replay for OneDrive integration. To sign up for the beta and learn more about Dropbox and Microsoft, visit dropbox.com/app-integrations/microsoft.\nFind and get to work on content with quick view, quick access, suggested actions, and more on the Dropbox web experience\nLast October, Dropbox introduced a redesigned web experience in response to customer feedback for faster access to their files. Today, the company is introducing several more improvements to help customers quickly find what they need so they can start doing their best work\u2014all in Dropbox.\nAll Dropbox customers will have access to new capabilities to:\nEasily preview a file as you navigate through your folders with quick view. Customers can now also identify what\u2019s inside a file or folder by hovering over it in grid view.\nGet to your favorite files quickly by pinning items within quick access in an updated left navigation bar.\nKickstart work with suggested quick actions for files\u2014like editing a PDF\u2014that change based on how users work.\nCustomers on paid plans will get additional features like the ability to:\nAccess content in fewer clicks with dynamic filters that automatically organize your content\u2014like by project name or themes.\nFind similar files faster with smart suggestions that show files related to what you\u2019re viewing, like similar PDFs.\nQuick view, quick access, and suggested quick actions will begin rolling out globally today. Dynamic filters and smart suggestions are now rolling out to paid plan users in the U.S. in English only.\nFast-track video, image, and audio reviews with new features in Dropbox Replay\nToday, video is the fastest-growing content-type on Dropbox, with over 1.5B videos uploaded every year. Since the company introduced Dropbox Replay, its rich media review and approval tool, customers have been sharing all the ways it\u2019s helped them speed up reviews and get to final delivery faster. For example, one Sundance film composer shared how Dropbox Replay helped him streamline his review process and finish the score in less than 20 days to meet the festival deadline.\nReplay fast-tracks the feedback process so users can finish projects on time\u2014and with features like live review, in just a few clicks, customers can start a live session to review audio and video files with collaborators in real-time. But today, customers are working across a multitude of content types, and they also need a simple way to put their brand front and center. That\u2019s why the company is introducing new capabilities to make it easier to do exactly that:\nAdded rich media support: Use Replay to review and approve more types of rich media, including PDF and PSD files.\nAvid Pro Tools integration: Review comments on audio files within the Avid platform.\nDynamic watermarking: Keep proprietary content protected and prevent unauthorized use by placing watermarks on work shared with collaborators. Watermarks include recipient email, IP address, date, and time of when the file is opened.\nCustom branding: Configure custom images, banners, logos, and colors within Replay project workspaces.\nThe Avid Pro Tools integration and added rich media support are available today to all Replay customers. Customers who upgrade to the paid Replay add-on can now also access dynamic watermarking and custom branding. To learn more, visit dropbox.com/replay.\nManage sensitive documents securely and get real-time deal insights with DocSend Advanced Data Rooms\nCustomers say they\u2019re spending too much time organizing deal files and sharing them via email. Without analytics and integration across tools, it\u2019s hard to tell which information is resonating with stakeholders, and challenging to keep files updated.\nThat\u2019s why Dropbox is introducing DocSend Advanced Data Rooms. They\u2019re designed to simplify the entire deal process from initial pitch to due diligence to final signature. With DocSend, businesses can offload administrative burdens and securely share the most impactful proprietary information faster, so teams have more time to focus on closing deals.\nConduct due diligence with confidence and control: Features like group permissions, visitor verification, and built-in NDAs give precise control over the most sensitive information.\nEmpower your team with real-time deal insights: Comprehensive data room analytics and page-by-page insights let teams make data-driven decisions.\nCreate and organize your virtual data room in minutes: Users can quickly put their best foot forward with features like data room templates, auto-indexing, and custom branding.\nTo learn more, visit https://www.docsend.com/features/virtual-data-room/.\nDropbox Dash helps teams instantly find what they need across their digital workspace\nWith the new realities of modern work, people are losing precious time trying to navigate hundreds of browser tabs, apps, and files on their desktop. In fact, research shows that people are switching between apps and sites nearly 1,200 times per day, which adds up to nearly 4 hours lost each week. The truth is, it shouldn\u2019t be easier for customers to search all of human knowledge than their own content or company knowledge.\nLast year, Dropbox set out to solve this problem with the launch of Dropbox Dash (beta), AI-powered universal search that connects tools, content, and apps in a single search bar. Dash interacts with everyday tools, so users can find anything from their workspace in seconds. Now, Dropbox is improving search and adding new capabilities based on customer feedback:\nIncreased access to Dash: Dash is just a click away on desktop and web. And with an improved Desktop app, it\u2019s easier for customers to find, organize, and share content.\nRedesigned Start Page: The Start Page, a single dashboard that lets you access universal search, view Stacks\u2014smart, shareable collections of content, and get shortcuts to recent work, offers a new experience that makes it simple to find content, fast. Dash now automatically groups different types of content into Stacks and displays them in a central hub.\nNew connectors: Dash now connects to more than 20 tools and apps customers use for work, including popular new additions like Microsoft OneNote and Zendesk.\nDropbox Dash is currently in beta and only available in the U.S. in English with new features starting to roll out today. To try out Dash, visit https://dash.dropbox.com.\nDropbox is committed to helping customers organize and share their most important content from one secure place.
