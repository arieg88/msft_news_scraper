        "Author": " Daniel Howley    and  Josh Schafer    ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) overtook Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday as the most valuable company in the world just two weeks after it took the No. 2 spot from Apple (AAPL).\nNvidia's stock price rose about 3.5%, eclipsing $135 per share and giving the chipmaker a market capitalization over $3.33 trillion. With a 0.4% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at nearly $3.32 trillion.\nShares of Nvidia are up more than 215% over the last 12 months and more than 3,400% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained 175%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024.\nNvidia first crossed a $1 trillion market cap on June 13, 2023. The stock advanced north of $2 trillion on March 1, and then rapidly crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time on June 5. The company's advance from a $1 trillion to a $3 trillion market cap was the fastest on record.\nNvidia's surge has made it a top weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the chipmaker has served a pivotal role in the benchmark index hitting record highs in 2024.\nUp until May, the S&P 500 had traded with a near-perfect correlation to Nvidia's price movement, meaning that as Nvidia's stock rose, so did the broader index. As of Monday, Nvidia's stock gains alone had contributed about one-third of the S&P 500's year-to-date rise, according to data from Citi's equity research team.\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10. \nThe company's rise comes amid the generative AI explosion that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT platform in late 2022. Nvidia's chips, modified graphics cards, and CUDA software platform are designed to both train and run AI programs, giving it a strategic advantage that experts say will take rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) years to overcome.\nNvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\nTech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.\nDuring a keynote at the Computex conference in Taiwan on June 2, CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip \u2014 called the Blackwell Ultra \u2014 in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\nNvidia's data center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\nBut AMD and Intel are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.\nIntel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.\nNvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "We recently published a list Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About \u2018Big 10\u2019 AI Stocks in 2024.\u00a0Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWhen the AI revolution started with the launch of ChatGPT, investors started pouring money into a handful of companies that are leading AI technology development, thanks to their industry position and unending free cash flows. Market analysts soon started pointing to the concentration of gains phenomena in the market, where just a few stocks accounted for most of the broader market gains. This tech concentration remains strong as of today, as all important AI and Cloud technologies that we see in the news are developed, acquired or marketed by mega-cap tech companies we\u2019re all familiar with. Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett recently said in a report that the S&P 500 has gained about 12% so far in the year, but if we remove 10 technology companies from the equation, these gains shrink to just 3.6%. Hartnett calls these companies the \u201cAI Big Ten\u201d group.\nWhat about the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that kept making headlines in 2023 and early 2024? Hartnett calculated that the broader market gained just 4.9% so far this year if these seven stocks are taken out of the equation. There is a third group of stocks that most investors are unaware of: Hedge Fund Top 30. These 30 stocks include the Magnificent Seven as well as 23 other promising stocks. These 30 stocks returned 53.2% in 2023, 20.2% during the first 5 months of 2024 vs. 11% for the S&P\u2019s large cap index. You can check out the latest list here:\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.\nIn this article we will take a look at the Big 10 AI stocks Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett highlighted in his report. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, as of the end of the March quarter. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares have gained about 15% so far this year. It is one of the Big 10 AI stocks highlighted by BofA recently.\nMany Wall Street analysts are bullish on MSFT. New Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOur second largest purchase during the quarter was the software platform,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), which we continued to add to, after initiating a position in the fourth quarter of 2023. Microsoft continues to report strong quarterly results, with revenue growth of 16% year-over-year in constant currency thanks to better-than-expected demand in its intelligent cloud segment, which saw revenue growth of 19% year-over-year, driven by Azure growth of 28% with AI contributing 6pts to growth compared with 3pts in the prior quarter. While the adoption of GenAI remains in its early stages, Microsoft has disclosed positive initial data points with 53,000 Azure AI customers as of its December quarter up from 18,000 in the prior quarter, 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers (up 30% sequentially) and more than 230,000 organizations who have used AI capabilities in the power platform (up 80% sequentially). Management also noted that large cloud optimizations that started a year or so ago have largely finished. Profitability also continues to be strong with 44% non-GAAP operating margins, which was 120bps better than expected.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About \u2018Big 10\u2019 AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Microsoft and Nvidia are now the world\u2019s most valuable companies. How Intel\u2014once the top chipmaker\u2014blew its shot to be one of them",
        "Author": "  Geoff Colvin ",
        "Text": "In the annals of business success stories few saw coming, Nvidia\u2019s incredible rise to surpass Microsoft and become the world\u2019s most valuable company is one for the books. This past week Nvidia, cofounded by Jensen Huang, edged out Microsoft as its market cap soared to $3.42 trillion. Yet it could have been otherwise. As business leaders marvel at Nvidia\u2019s rise, it\u2019s worth remembering that another company\u2014Intel\u2014came tantalizingly close to being where Nvidia is now.\nInstead, Intel is waging a heroic effort to regain its place as the world\u2019s preeminent maker of leading edge chips. The story of how it lost that position is part of a recent Fortune case study.\nAs detailed in the piece, a key moment occurred in the mid-2000s, when Paul Otellini, then CEO of Intel, said a word to Steve Jobs he almost never heard: No.\nIt was 2006, and Intel, the global king of computer chips, was bringing in record revenue and profits by dominating the kinds of chips in hottest demand\u2014for personal computers and data centers. Now Jobs wanted Intel to make a different type of chip for a product that didn\u2019t even exist, which would be called the iPhone.\nOtellini knew chips for phones and tablets were the next big thing, but Intel had to devote substantial capital and its best minds to the fabulously profitable business it already possessed. Besides, \u201cno one knew what the iPhone would do,\u201d he told\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0seven years later, just before he stepped down as CEO. \u201cThere was a chip that they were interested in, that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more, and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn\u2019t see it.\u201d\nOtellini, who died in 2017, was a highly successful CEO by many measures. But if that decision had gone the other way, Intel might have become a chip titan of the post-PC era. Instead, it gave up on phone chips in 2016 after losing billions trying to become a significant player. As he left the company, Otellini seemed to grasp the magnitude of his decision: \u201cThe world would have been a lot different if we\u2019d done it.\u201d\nMeantime, some 800 miles north, in Seattle,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0was struggling to find its role in a tech world dominated by the internet, mobile devices, social media, and search. Investors were not impressed by its efforts. No one could have foreseen that years later, a few key decisions would set the company up as an AI powerhouse and send its stock soaring.\nThere was a time not so long ago that Microsoft and Intel were both atop the tech world. They were neither competitors nor significant customers of each other, but what New York University\u2019s Adam Brandenburger and Yale\u2019s Barry Nalebuff deemed \u201ccomplementors.\u201d Microsoft built its hugely profitable Windows operating system over the years to work on computers that used Intel\u2019s chips, and Intel designed new chips to run Windows (hence \u201cWintel\u201d). The system fueled the leading tech product of the 1990s, the personal computer. Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates became a celebrity wonk billionaire, and Intel CEO Andy Grove was\u00a0Time\u2019s 1997 Man of the Year.\nSnubbing Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t the only cause of Intel\u2019s decline, but it was a significant one. Intel also tried and failed to develop a GPU (graphics processing unit), which turned out to be the type of chip used in AI development and that Nvidia designs. What if Intel had succeeded? It was the world\u2019s sixth most valuable company in 2000 and the largest maker of semiconductors; today it\u2019s No. 69 by value and No. 2 in semiconductors by revenue, far behind No. 1 TSMC (and in some years also behind\u00a0Samsung).\nA Fortune 500 CEO makes thousands of decisions in a career, a few of which will turn out to be momentous. What\u2019s easy to explain in hindsight\u2014that Microsoft would be at the forefront of AI, that\u00a0Google\u00a0would become a behemoth, that Blockbuster would fade into obscurity\u2014is never preordained. Often the fateful decisions are identifiable only in retrospect. Nothing more vividly illustrates this than the parallel stories of Microsoft and Intel, and the failures at the latter that cleared the way for the moonshot rise of Nvidia. The case study of what went right and wrong at these giant corporations offers a master class in business strategy not just for today\u2019s front-runners at the likes of Nvidia, Google, Open AI,\u00a0Amazon, and elsewhere\u2014but also for any Fortune 500 leader hoping to survive and thrive in the coming decade.\nYou can read the full case study here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n.\n"

        "Author": "  Lucas Wong ",
        "Text": "With a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) holds the title of the largest publicly traded company globally. Following its acquisition of OpenAI, the software giant has aggressively expanded its customer base and significantly enhanced its overall performance. The company's shares have surged in recent quarters, surpassing expectations and delivering substantial returns. I expect this trend to persist, as Microsoft continues to lead in the artificial intelligence space and invest heavily in new AI initiatives, building on the success achieved with OpenAI.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nFigure 1: Microsoft shares have surged since late 2023\nSource: GuruFocus\nMicrosoft has strategically positioned itself ahead of its competitors through massive research and development spending, large acquisitions and strategic partnerships with external companies. These maneuvers have provided the company with a competitive edge, enabling it to outshine rivals and roll out AI services to end users more quickly and effectively. The intensifying competition between Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) updated Gemini and OpenAI's flagship GPT-4 underscores the evolving landscape of generative AI. As more multi-modal interactive platforms are launched, it is clear we are witnessing a three-horse race in the generative AI arena. Microsoft is likely to benefit temporarily from its early investments in OpenAI, solidifying its position as a leader in the field.\nMicrosoft is actively deploying AI-as-a-service features on its Azure cloud computing platform, which has become one of the company's largest revenue generators, surpassing even its Office software suite. The launch of Azure in 2010 marked a pivotal change in the company's revenue trajectory. Seven years post-launch, it saw significant revenue jumps, largely driven by the success of Azure. This trend continues today, with Microsoft's cloud computing services contributing substantially to its financial growth.\nFigure 2: Azure has been the key driver of Microsoft's revenue growth\nSource: GuruFocus\nGiven Azure's significant contribution to Microsoft's revenue, it is crucial for the company to continuously attract new customers to sustain the expected growth. Microsoft is well-positioned to achieve this, as evidenced by Azure's capture of 25% of the cloud market, even as Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS has seen a slight decline in market share. The ongoing cloud super-cycle and the generative AI boom have been key factors in Azure's growing market share, which now stands at 25%, gradually closing the gap with AWS, which holds 31%.\nFigure 3: Azure inches closer to market leader AWS\nSource: Statista\nWith the increasing demand for cloud services and AI capabilities, Microsoft is poised to continue exceeding market expectations. Azure's robust performance and strategic advancements ensure it remains a critical component of the company's overall success, reinforcing its leadership in the rapidly evolving cloud and AI industries.\nMicrosoft made headlines with its substantial acquisition of a significant stake in OpenAI back in 2019, initially investing $1 billion. Since then, the company has invested an additional $10 billion into this partnership. Beyond this major investment, it has also made several other notable investments in cloud computing and AI in recent months.\nJust in the past two months, Microsoft announced a series of strategic investments: $2.9 billion in Japan to open a research center in Tokyo, $1.5 billion in the United Arab Emirates for a stake in AI company G42 and infrastructure and $3.3 billion in Wisconsin to build a manufacturing-focused AI research lab, among others. More recently, the company announced it they will invest $3.2 billion to expand its cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Sweden over a two-year period. Additionally, Microsoft's venture capital fund, M12, has taken positions in several private AI companies. One of the most notable moves was a $650 million stake in Inflection AI, co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Suleyman, a prominent figure in the AI space, is now the head of AI at Microsoft.\nFigure 4: Generative AI to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032 (according to a Bloomberg study)\nSouce: Bloomberg\nWith the generative AI market expected to exceed $1 trillion in value within the next decade and global IT spending is forecasted to grow at 8% this year, Microsoft is well-positioned to scale its business significantly. These strategic investments provide the company with numerous catalysts to drive growth and solidify its leadership in the AI industry for the foreseeable future.\nIn its earnings report for the third quarter of 2024, which was released last month, Microsoft reported a remarkable 17.1% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $61.90 billion. The company's GAAP earnings per share were $2.94. The operating margin expanded significantly from 42.30% to 44.60%, demonstrating substantial improvement for a company of its scale. This growth was achieved despite costs associated with the acquisition of Activision and an accounting change related to the useful life and depreciation of certain data center equipment. Both the top-line and bottom-line results exceeded expectations.\nFigure 5: Third-quarter earnings summary\nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\nA key driver of this performance was the accelerating growth of the Intelligent Cloud segment, Microsoft's largest and fastest-growing business, which saw a 21% year-over-year increase to $26.70 billion, with operating margins expanding to 46.80% (up 4 points). Additionally, search and news advertising revenue grew by 3.30% year over year to $3.13 billion, aided by the market share gains of OpenAI-powered Bing, which reached 3.64% of the search engine market as of April 2024. As a result of these strong performances, Microsoft's quarterly levered free cash flow increased from $13.50 billion to $16.90 billion, despite a $4.30 billion increase in capital expenditures.\nFigure 6: Intelligent Cloud segment revenue and operating income performance\nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\nRevenue growth is crucial for Microsoft's future success, particularly as the costs of training new AI models and improving Azure, its primary AI delivery method, continue to rise. The company has demonstrated robust growth over the past few years, with mid-teens growth in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, Microsoft is expected to continue exceeding expectations, with projected revenue of $64.40 billion, indicating 14.60% year over year expected growth. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to grow from $2.69 to $2.93, reflecting improved operating leverage. A significant driver of this growth is its flagship AI product, Copilot, which has been instrumental in scaling subscriptions and generating sales. As Copilot gains traction, Microsoft has announced new functions for its AI assistant, which could create new streams of recurring revenue. Additionally, the integration of GPT-4o into Bing is expected to attract more users and expand Microsoft's share in the search market. Bing recently captured over 10% of the search market, suggesting that Google's monopoly is being challenged.\nAccording to management guidance, full-year operating margins are expected to increase by over 2 points despite cloud and AI investments, the impact of the Activision acquisition and changes in useful life accounting. This margin expansion highlights Microsoft's efficiency and disciplined cost management, with expectations for continued growth in cloud and AI investments next year, which are high-margin revenue streams. The same trajectory of margin improvement is anticipated into 2025, driven by these factors.\nBeyond the impressive revenue and margin figures, Microsoft's free cash flow is a standout financial strength. The company is cash-rich with an $80 billion cash pile supporting its acquisition and talent hiring strategies. Last 12 months free cash flow generation reached $70.57 billion (up 22.90% sequentially), enabling aggressive partnerships and M&A activities, including the recent $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. While there was a reduction last year, the company is on track to outperform and increase its free cash flow this year, providing ample resources for future acquisitions. The gap between cash from operations and free cash flow has widened as management has invested heavily in cloud and AI infrastructure, suggesting that FCF could expand much faster in the medium to long term once the infrastructure build-out is completed.\nFigure 7: CFO, FCF and capex progression \nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\nMicrosoft has committed substantial resources to research and development and capital expenditures, with last 12-month R&D expenses of $28.19 billion (up 3.20% sequentially) and capital expenditures of $39.54 billion (up 51.9% sequentially). These investments ensure Microsoft remains well-capitalized to pursue growth opportunities. Management's commitment to sustaining momentum in the cloud and AI business is evident from the rapid ramp-up in investments in these areas.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, Microsoft had $80 billion in cash and short-term investments and $65.44 billion in long-term debt. The company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio stands at 0.60, indicating strong financial health and the ability to pay down its long-term debt efficiently.\nAlthough Microsoft has significant potential upside if its generative AI goals go according to plan, the stock is currently not the most affordable despite being a sensible long-term investment. It is important to note long-term plays often require substantial time to yield returns. Despite the numerous growth catalysts in its favor, the current share price offers little margin of safety to warrant a bullish rating at this juncture. While Microsoft's business has performed exceptionally well and is likely to continue thriving, there are questions about whether it is prudent to purchase shares at the current levels. Various valuation methods indicate that none provide a sufficient margin to justify buying at the current price. Even with aggressive estimates for Microsoft's growth rates, margins and free cash flow generation, it is challenging to justify a long position solely based on fundamentals.\nFigure 8: Microsoft's current valuations lack sufficient upside margins\nSource: valueinvesting.io\nFurther, Microsoft might face more intense competition in its AI business from both large companies within the Magnificent Seven and smaller, emerging players. Although the tech company is perceived as an AI leader today, this may not hold true five or 10 years from now. Additionally, economic uncertainties persist, with inflation remaining high and the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates still on the table. Microsoft's substantial spending on building its cloud platform and AI tools could be viewed unfavorably by investors if the economy deteriorates.\nGiven these factors, I am not assigning a buy rating to Microsoft's shares at the current price. Therefore, I recommend a hold on the stock and will monitor the price action closely. Should there be any negative movements while the current fundamentals persist, it might swing my recommendation to a buy at a lower price.\nMicrosoft's impressive financial performance, strategic investments in AI and cloud computing and robust growth outlook underscore its potential for long-term success. However, given the current valuation and economic uncertainties, the stock lacks a sufficient margin of safety to justify a bullish rating at present.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list titled\u00a010 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nUBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s (GWM) recently\u00a0published\u00a0a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI \u201cvalue chain,\u201d estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.\nUBS segments the AI market into three layers \u2013\u00a0 Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem \u2014 infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments,\u00a0 Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it\u2019s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers \u2014 think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\nKey AI Predictions\nThe UBS report also made key \u201cpredictions\u201d about the AI landscape. The firm\u2019s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a \u201ccapex cycle\u201d that could \u201cinflate\u201d the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects \u201cmonolithic players\u201d and \u201cAI foundries\u201d prevailing in the near future.\nBased on this report, let\u2019s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

        "Text": "Off the back of a strong third quarter, Microsoft is reportedly laying off somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 workers across its Azure cloud and mixed reality departments. And in a leaked memo as tone-deaf as it is bland, an executive at the company proclaimed that their peons' sacrifices are not in vain, for they are being done on the altar of the almighty \"AI wave.\"\n\"Our clear focus as a company is to define the AI wave and empower all our customers to succeed in the adoption of this transformative technology,\" wrote Jason Zander, executive vice president of Strategic Missions and Technologies at Microsoft, in an email to employees quoted by Business Insider. \"Along the way, we make decisions that align with our long-term vision and strategy while ensuring the sustainability and growth of Microsoft.\"\nLayoffs at big tech companies are practically de rigueur these days, even though the corporations are more powerful and wealthy than ever. This is frequently chalked up to systemic overhiring \u2014 which may well be true to a certain extent \u2014 but it's clear that those jobs are also being swept out to make room for investments in AI.\nMicrosoft last year, for example, laid off 10,000 employees right as it announced it was shoveling another $10 billion in OpenAI. Among those fired was every single person who worked in the company's AI \"Ethics and Society\" division \u2014 a dismal sign of things to come.\nSince then, it's emerged that the company is reportedly willing to spend an eye-watering $100 billion to build a supercomputer to train an advanced new AI. And despite its existing hefty investments in OpenAI, Microsoft also reportedly wants to develop its own large language model.\nThose investments come at a cost: monetary, of course, but also human. The layoffs at Microsoft have been less sweeping this year, but behind the scenes, there's a lot of reorganizing going on, including the formation of a whole new division simply called \"Microsoft AI\" as the company shifts more workers to projects like Copilot, its ChatGPT-like assistant.\n\"It's never easy to make these tough decisions, particularly when they affect our colleagues and friends,\" Zander wrote, affecting their best impression of a human that's torn-up about their actions. \"We're dedicated to supporting everyone impacted by these changes with respect, dignity, and transparency to fully support them through this transition.\"\nMore on Microsoft: Windows Feature That Records Everything You Do Can Easily Be Hacked\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled the list of the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0stands against the other quality stocks.\nInvesting in 2024 is significantly different from investing in the 1950s and onward. This is because these days investors have to. sift through thousands of stocks and countless data points and signals to separate the wheat from the chaff and make the right investment decisions. Amidst this hubris, the ability to pick out 'quality' stocks becomes important, and there's quite a lot of financial literature available that helps determine what such stocks are.\nTypically, stock analysis involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine profitability, operating strengths, cost control, asset utilization, and other metrics. Some of these are also present in financial literature that discusses quality stocks. One such research paper comes courtesy of researchers associated with Research Affiliates. They point out that metrics that typically define a quality stock include earnings stability, capital structure, profitability, accounting practices, and investing strategies. Within these, the quality factors that were also related to returns were investment strategies, dividend payouts, profitability, and accounting strategies.\nThe next thing to ask is, whether quality stocks are any different from standard run of the mill stocks when it comes to share price performance. For context, the last 12 months on the stock market have been dominated by a few key themes. These are artificial intelligence, inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth. Higher rates and inflation are bearish stock indicators, while growth and AI have proven to have kept the market buoyant at a time when rates are at two decade high levels. So, over the past year, exchange traded funds that track quality stocks have appreciated by 12% to 27%, the midpoint of which is slightly lower than the S&P 500's 23% price appreciation over the same time period. However, picking the right quality stocks appears to have its advantages as well, since the high end of the performance, i.e. 27%, is far higher than what the index has delivered.\nETFs and research aren't the only ones that talk about quality stocks. One hedge fund that's become quite well known for its focus on quality stocks is Cliff Asness\u2019 AQR Capital Management. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, AQR had a 13F investment portfolio worth $58 billion as of Q1 2024 end according to Insider Monkey's research. Close to a quarter of its portfolio is invested in the technology industry, and the second biggest category is services stocks. AQR focuses on stocks that follow its strategy of Quality Minus Junk or QMJ. According to its founder Cliff Asness, a quality stock is defined by its shareholder payouts, growth, profitability, and sound financial and general management. We recently took a look at some top AQR Capital management stocks and you can check them out by looking at 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.\nBefore we head to our list of the best quality stocks, a general overview of the stock market is relevant. Right now, investors are wondering when the first interest rate cuts might occur. The latest bit on this front came in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data from the Commerce Department. This data set revealed that the 12 month inflation in the US stood at 2.7% in April 2024, which was still higher than the Fed's preferred rate of 2%. Additionally, the data also provided investors with some bearish signals. These were apparent in the readings for consumer spending, which slowed down to 2% in the first quarter of 2024 over the robust 3.3% reading in Q4 2023.\nLower spending means less money sloshing in the economy, and while this might help reduce prices, it can also affect business performance, economic growth, and naturally, stock market performance. Data from the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that 47% of all investors polled expect a 25 basis point rate cut in September, while an additional 7.5% believe that the Fed might get generous and cut rates by as much as 50 basis points.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top quality stocks that hedge funds are buying.\nA technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope.\nMethodology\nTo make our list of the best quality stocks to buy, we ranked the 30 largest constituents of a quality stock ETF and picked out those with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2024. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Like its big tech peers, the average of 47 one year share ratings for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is Strong Buy.

While other software players like Salesforce have suffered, RBC Capital maintained an Overweight rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in May 2024 and it increased the share price target to $500 from $450. At the heart of RBC Capital's strong bullishness was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s early lead in AI, which it believes stands in contrast with the firm's Azure cloud computing platform that had had to catch up with Amazon's AWS.\nBy the end of this year's first quarter, 293 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had held a stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Expectedly Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust owned the most valuable stake which was worth $15.3 billion.\nWhen compared to Alphabet and Meta, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s forward P/E ratio of 30.96 makes it significantly overvalued compared to the broader markets.

Ithaka Group shared some of the reasons behind Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s recent share price gains in its Q1 2024 investor letter.

Microsoft\u2019s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, software development tools, video games, and business-solution applications. The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft\u2019s stock appreciated based on excitement surrounding the company\u2019s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI, which will be through both Azure and Microsoft Copilot, the company\u2019s new GenAI personal assistant.\nOverall, MSFT ranks first among the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy now.

        "Text": "Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$431 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$389. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$428 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Microsoft\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 1.05% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $423.43, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 53% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MSFT\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $3.24 trillion, falling behind Apple for the first time in five months.\nThe stock surge comes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a record high on fresh signs of cooling inflation.\nApple shares had added more than 7% in the previous session, a day after it unveiled a range of AI-enabled features and software enhancements for its devices, a move that several analysts said would power iPhone sales.\nAt Apple's annual developer conference on Monday, executives, including CEO Tim Cook, touted how voice assistant Siri would be able to interact with messages, emails, calendar as well as third-party apps.\n\"All those questions about Apple lagging from an AI technology standpoint were answered at the Worldwide Developers Conference,\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\n\"Some of the specifics about AI capabilities that are going to be integrated into the upcoming iPhones made it very apparent that there will clearly be demand for a significant upgrade cycle.\"\nThe tech giant has trailed rivals such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet in the red-hot field of AI, a reason why its shares underperformed this year compared to its peers.\nSome of the concerns over its weak share performance, however, eased after Apple beat market expectations for quarterly results and forecast in May, and unveiled a record $110 billion buyback plan.\nApple's shares have risen about 12% so far in 2024, while Microsoft has added about 16% and Alphabet nearly 28%.\nAI chip leader Nvidia, which briefly overtook Apple's market value last week, is up a whopping 154% this year.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Microsoft with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Microsoft grew its EPS by 16% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Microsoft shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 41% to 45%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Microsoft's forecast profits?\nOwing to the size of Microsoft, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.1b. We note that this amounts to 0.03% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Microsoft but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\nOne positive for Microsoft is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Microsoft that you need to be mindful of.\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

An allegedly Chinese hacking group that separately breached Microsoft last year stole thousands of U.S. government emails.\nThe Russian government has never responded to the Microsoft hacking allegations, but Microsoft has said the hackers targeted cybersecurity researchers who had been investigating the Russian hacking group's actions.\n\"This week we are continuing notifications to customers who corresponded with Microsoft corporate email accounts that were exfiltrated by the Midnight Blizzard threat actor,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Bloomberg first reported on the action earlier in the day.\nMicrosoft said it was also sharing the compromised emails with its customers, but did not say how many customers had been impacted, nor how many emails may have been stolen.\n\"This is increased detail for customers who have already been notified and also includes new notifications,\" the spokesperson said. \"We\u2019re committed to sharing information with our customers as our investigation continues.\"\nBack in January, the world's largest software vendor had said that Midnight Blizzard had accessed \"a very small percentage\" of the company's corporate email accounts. Four months later it said those hackers were still trying to break in, alarming many of its security industry peers and customers who questioned why Microsoft's systems remained vulnerable.\nThose intrusions, and the Chinese hack last year, prompted a Congressional hearing earlier this month where Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company was working on overhauling its security practices.\n(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco and Leroy Leo in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai and Stephen Coates)\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The projected fair value for Microsoft is US$415 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$447 suggests Microsoft is potentially trading close to its fair value\nOur fair value estimate is 15% lower than Microsoft's analyst price target of US$490\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$68.7b\nUS$77.7b\nUS$92.7b\nUS$109.0b\nUS$131.4b\nUS$148.0b\nUS$162.3b\nUS$174.3b\nUS$184.6b\nUS$193.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x25\nAnalyst x26\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x6\nAnalyst x5\nEst @ 12.70%\nEst @ 9.60%\nEst @ 7.44%\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.86%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% \nUS$64.2k\nUS$67.9k\nUS$75.7k\nUS$83.2k\nUS$93.8k\nUS$98.8k\nUS$101.2k\nUS$101.7k\nUS$100.7k\nUS$98.7k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$886b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$194b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.4%) = US$4.3t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.3t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$2.2t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.1t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$447, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.998. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Sales from its suite of Office products also jumped by double digits. Personal computing-related devices and services also increased by 17%.\nThat helps explain why Microsoft shares have jumped by more than 30% over the past year. The move higher has brought the company's market capitalization to over $3 trillion. But one Wall Street analyst already sees the $4 trillion mark on the horizon.\nNew Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu just initiated coverage on the tech giant with a \"buy\" rating and a $570 price target. That stock price would represent a gain of 33% from recent levels and give Microsoft a market cap of more than $4.2 trillion.\nFerragu noted that a key part of Microsoft's success has been monetizing its cloud business, which has helped drive profitability higher. He expects more of the same to continue driving the stock higher. But now Microsoft has an added catalyst, too.\nMicrosoft quickly partnered with OpenAI when that company set off the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ferragu thinks the company is in a good position with its Copilot AI offering. He thinks AI alone \"could boost growth by several points every year, and for many years.\"\nMicrosoft's strong legacy business makes it a stock that most investors should want to hold. But that strength, and the potential for future profits from AI, make it a fairly expensive one, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the mid-30s. That makes it a good candidate to buy in stages over time, increasing ownership as the market cycles.\nBut it is likely that eventually, Ferragu will be right, and Microsoft will one day be a $4 trillion company.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0stands against the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. But first, we are going to take a look at what the markets are doing.\nGlobal financial markets reacted with volatility today as the yen stumbled against the dollar, marking a significant decline after the Bank of Japan's cautious stance on reducing bond purchases. European stock futures, in contrast, showed signs of recovery following Thursday's substantial selloff, while Asian markets painted a mixed picture with losses in Australian and Chinese shares juxtaposed against gains in Korean equities. The yen experienced a notable decline against the dollar following the Bank of Japan's announcement of a delay in detailing its plans for reducing bond purchases, leading to a surge in Japanese sovereign bond futures.\nThis move came amidst contrasting market reactions across different regions on Thursday. While European stock futures saw gains recovering from the previous day's heavy sell-off, Asian markets faced mixed fortunes: Australian and Chinese shares retreated, while Korean stocks advanced. Specifically, the yen dropped by as much as 0.6% to 157.98 against the dollar initially, although it later recovered some of its losses. This development triggered significant movements in bond markets, where benchmark 10-year bonds saw yields plummeting to 0.915% as futures surged, marking the most substantial increase since late December. The Bank of Japan's decision to delay specifics on reducing debt purchases until its next policy meeting underscored lingering uncertainties in the financial landscape. This cautious approach prompted traders to recalibrate expectations for an imminent rate hike, as reflected in reduced bets within the swaps market. In parallel, Japanese equities displayed resilience amid the broader regional downturn, with the Topix Index surging by up to 0.9%. The overall market sentiment reflected a cautious optimism tempered by the central bank's deferred actions, highlighting the nuanced responses in global financial markets amidst ongoing economic adjustments and policy recalibrations.\nIn the current quarter, Bitcoin is facing stiff competition from traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have outperformed the cryptocurrency amidst growing skepticism about its rebound prospects. JPMorgan strategists have raised concerns over a potential slowdown in inflows into the crypto market, highlighting broader doubts about its sustained growth. As of midday Friday in Singapore, Bitcoin has seen a decline of approximately 5% since the beginning of April, trailing behind global equity indices, fixed income benchmarks, and even commodities like gold. This underperformance underscores a shifting sentiment in financial markets, where investors appear to be favoring more established asset classes over the volatility and uncertainty associated with digital currencies. The contrast in performance between Bitcoin and traditional investments reflects a cautious stance among market participants, who are closely monitoring developments in both economic policy and regulatory environments that could further impact the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. This dynamic landscape suggests a recalibration of investment strategies amid evolving market conditions and changing perceptions of risk.\nThailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund is banking on a diversified strategy centered around gold, commodities, and private equity to offset lackluster performance in domestic stocks, amid challenging market conditions in recent times. According to Songpol Chevapanyaroj, the secretary-general of the state pension fund, the portfolio is poised to deliver returns exceeding 3% for the year 2024, a notable improvement from the 1.5% achieved in 2023. This optimistic outlook reflects strategic shifts within the fund, including increased allocations to gold and commodities. These investments are positioned as hedges against inflationary pressures and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, enhancing the fund's resilience against market volatilities. The decision underscores a proactive approach by Thailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund to navigate through economic uncertainties and optimize returns in a diversified investment landscape. By diversifying into alternative assets alongside traditional holdings, the fund aims to strengthen its financial position and achieve sustainable growth amid evolving global economic dynamics.\nDuring the week leading up to Wednesday, investors shifted their focus within the U.S. equity market, favoring growth stocks while shedding value stocks, reports BofA Global Research. This movement coincided with unexpected stability in the U.S. consumer price index data for May, which contributed to a decline in bond yields and heightened expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. According to BofA, there was a significant influx of $1.8 billion into U.S. growth stock funds, contrasted by $2.6 billion in outflows from U.S. value stocks during the same period. This trend underscores a preference among investors for sectors and companies expected to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment, where growth stocks historically perform well.\nIn addition to these equity shifts, the report highlights broader movements in financial markets. Investors allocated approximately $40 billion into cash, reflecting a cautious stance amidst market uncertainties. Concurrently, there was notable demand for U.S. Treasuries, with $1.8 billion flowing into these safe-haven assets, alongside $7.7 billion directed towards investment-grade bonds. The Federal Reserve's revised forecast of potentially one rate cut this year, down from earlier expectations of three cuts, further influenced market sentiment. This adjustment in monetary policy outlooks likely played a role in reshaping investor strategies and asset allocations throughout the week. Overall, the dynamics observed in U.S. equity flows and bond markets reflect a nuanced response to economic data and central bank signals, highlighting investors' adaptability amidst evolving financial conditions and expectations.\nIn our original article we listed 10 companies whose price targets were raised by analysts and ranked them by their upside potential by comparing their current market price with the raised price target.\nUpside Potential: 25%\nOn June 13, Tigress Financial increased its price target for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by $75 to $550 per share, indicating a substantial potential upside of 25%.

        "Author": "  Umar Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled the list of the 10 Stocks That Are Upgraded by Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0stands against the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. But first, we are going to take a look at what the markets are doing.\nGlobal financial markets reacted with volatility today as the yen stumbled against the dollar, marking a significant decline after the Bank of Japan's cautious stance on reducing bond purchases. European stock futures, in contrast, showed signs of recovery following Thursday's substantial selloff, while Asian markets painted a mixed picture with losses in Australian and Chinese shares juxtaposed against gains in Korean equities. The yen experienced a notable decline against the dollar following the Bank of Japan's announcement of a delay in detailing its plans for reducing bond purchases, leading to a surge in Japanese sovereign bond futures.\nThis move came amidst contrasting market reactions across different regions on Thursday. While European stock futures saw gains recovering from the previous day's heavy sell-off, Asian markets faced mixed fortunes: Australian and Chinese shares retreated, while Korean stocks advanced. Specifically, the yen dropped by as much as 0.6% to 157.98 against the dollar initially, although it later recovered some of its losses. This development triggered significant movements in bond markets, where benchmark 10-year bonds saw yields plummeting to 0.915% as futures surged, marking the most substantial increase since late December. The Bank of Japan's decision to delay specifics on reducing debt purchases until its next policy meeting underscored lingering uncertainties in the financial landscape. This cautious approach prompted traders to recalibrate expectations for an imminent rate hike, as reflected in reduced bets within the swaps market. In parallel, Japanese equities displayed resilience amid the broader regional downturn, with the Topix Index surging by up to 0.9%. The overall market sentiment reflected a cautious optimism tempered by the central bank's deferred actions, highlighting the nuanced responses in global financial markets amidst ongoing economic adjustments and policy recalibrations.\nIn the current quarter, Bitcoin is facing stiff competition from traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have outperformed the cryptocurrency amidst growing skepticism about its rebound prospects. JPMorgan strategists have raised concerns over a potential slowdown in inflows into the crypto market, highlighting broader doubts about its sustained growth. As of midday Friday in Singapore, Bitcoin has seen a decline of approximately 5% since the beginning of April, trailing behind global equity indices, fixed income benchmarks, and even commodities like gold. This underperformance underscores a shifting sentiment in financial markets, where investors appear to be favoring more established asset classes over the volatility and uncertainty associated with digital currencies. The contrast in performance between Bitcoin and traditional investments reflects a cautious stance among market participants, who are closely monitoring developments in both economic policy and regulatory environments that could further impact the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. This dynamic landscape suggests a recalibration of investment strategies amid evolving market conditions and changing perceptions of risk.\nThailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund is banking on a diversified strategy centered around gold, commodities, and private equity to offset lackluster performance in domestic stocks, amid challenging market conditions in recent times. According to Songpol Chevapanyaroj, the secretary-general of the state pension fund, the portfolio is poised to deliver returns exceeding 3% for the year 2024, a notable improvement from the 1.5% achieved in 2023. This optimistic outlook reflects strategic shifts within the fund, including increased allocations to gold and commodities. These investments are positioned as hedges against inflationary pressures and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, enhancing the fund's resilience against market volatilities. The decision underscores a proactive approach by Thailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund to navigate through economic uncertainties and optimize returns in a diversified investment landscape. By diversifying into alternative assets alongside traditional holdings, the fund aims to strengthen its financial position and achieve sustainable growth amid evolving global economic dynamics.\nDuring the week leading up to Wednesday, investors shifted their focus within the U.S. equity market, favoring growth stocks while shedding value stocks, reports BofA Global Research. This movement coincided with unexpected stability in the U.S. consumer price index data for May, which contributed to a decline in bond yields and heightened expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. According to BofA, there was a significant influx of $1.8 billion into U.S. growth stock funds, contrasted by $2.6 billion in outflows from U.S. value stocks during the same period. This trend underscores a preference among investors for sectors and companies expected to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment, where growth stocks historically perform well.\nIn addition to these equity shifts, the report highlights broader movements in financial markets. Investors allocated approximately $40 billion into cash, reflecting a cautious stance amidst market uncertainties. Concurrently, there was notable demand for U.S. Treasuries, with $1.8 billion flowing into these safe-haven assets, alongside $7.7 billion directed towards investment-grade bonds. The Federal Reserve's revised forecast of potentially one rate cut this year, down from earlier expectations of three cuts, further influenced market sentiment. This adjustment in monetary policy outlooks likely played a role in reshaping investor strategies and asset allocations throughout the week. Overall, the dynamics observed in U.S. equity flows and bond markets reflect a nuanced response to economic data and central bank signals, highlighting investors' adaptability amidst evolving financial conditions and expectations.\nIn our original article we listed 10 companies whose price targets were raised by analysts and ranked them by their upside potential by comparing their current market price with the raised price target.\nUpside Potential: 25%\nOn June 13, Tigress Financial increased its price target for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by $75 to $550 per share, indicating a substantial potential upside of 25%. This bullish adjustment reflects Tigress Financial's confidence in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic positioning within the competitive technology and AI markets, as well as its robust financial performance. Analyst Ivan Feinseth emphasized Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) proactive integration of AI capabilities, particularly evident in products such as ChatGPT, which is anticipated to drive significant growth and innovation across various business operations.\nMicrosoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent financial results have further bolstered this optimism. In Q1 2024, the company surpassed expectations with earnings per share (EPS) of $2.99, underscoring strong revenue growth, especially within its cloud computing segment. The robust performance of Azure and increasing demand for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI-powered solutions are key drivers fueling Tigress Financial's positive outlook on the stock.\nThe strategic investments Microsoft continues to make in AI and cloud technologies, coupled with its strategic acquisition of Activision Blizzard, are viewed as crucial elements for future growth and market expansion. Analysts maintain a strong buy consensus for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recognizing its leadership in technological innovation and its ability to capitalize on evolving industry trends.

The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.\nMore than 90% of Ballmer\u2019s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.\nGates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.\nSince they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.\nIn 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world\u2019s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills.

It risks a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if it is found guilty of latest alleged antitrust breaches.\nThe Commission said action Microsoft had taken did not sufficiently address its concerns and that more changes were necessary to restore competition.\nThe EU enforcer wants the company to sell Office without Teams at a lower price than what it has announced, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, while rivals want clearer interoperability terms and more incentives for users to switch to them.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith reiterated comments made earlier this month about the company's willingness to resolve the issue.\n\"Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission's remaining concerns,\" Smith said.\nSalesforce President and Chief Legal Officer Sabastian Niles urged the Commission to move towards a swift, binding and effective remedy to restore a free and fair choice.\nGerman rival and complainant Alfaview also welcomed the Commission's charge against Microsoft.\nTeams was added to Office 365 in 2017 for free and it subsequently replaced Skype for Business. Its popularity soared during the pandemic due in part to its video conferencing but rivals said bundling the products together gave Microsoft an unfair advantage.\nMicrosoft in April separated Teams from Office globally to try to resolve EU antitrust concerns and also made it easier for rivals to function with its products but sources said the unbundling was unlikely to appease regulators.\n($1 = 0.9321 euros)\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Barbara Lewis)\n"

        "Text": "Three-year, projected multi-billion-dollar strategic partnership will focus on creating innovative industry solutions that deliver transformative outcomes for businesses and society.\nHitachi Group will embed the Microsoft cloud, Azure Open AI Service, Dynamics 365, Copilot for Microsoft 365 and GitHub Copilot into their Lumada Solutions to accelerate growth of the Lumada business, and improve productivity for their 270 thousand employees.\nHitachi will train more than 50 thousand \"GenAI Professionals\" on advanced AI skills. As part of the partnership, Hitachi will incorporate training provided by Microsoft into Hitachi\u2019s training.\nREDMOND, Wash. & TOKYO, June 04, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hitachi, Ltd. (TSE:6501) and Microsoft Corporation announced a projected multi-billion dollar collaboration over the next three years, that will accelerate social innovation with generative AI. Through this strategic alliance, Hitachi will propel growth of the Lumada business, with a planned revenue of 2.65 trillion yen (18.9 billion USD)*1 in FY2024, and will promote operational efficiency and productivity improvements for Hitachi Group\u2019s 270 thousand employees.\nSpecifically, Hitachi will embed the Microsoft cloud, Azure Open AI Service, Dynamics 365, Copilot for Microsoft 365, and GitHub Copilot into Lumada solutions to provide innovative solutions for the energy, mobility and other industries to deliver better outcomes for businesses and society. In addition, the two companies will promote joint projects to address pressing business needs such as bolstering cloud services, enhancing security, and mitigating the environmental footprint of data centers, which have become an increasing area of focus with the growing use of generative AI.\n\"Hitachi has been driving transformation by applying AI across the Hitachi Group to improve productivity and will invest 300 billion yen (2.1 billion USD)*1 in GenAI to capture new growth opportunities in FY2024. Hitachi and Microsoft have already been working on a variety of co-creation projects including the development of next-generation digital solutions for the manufacturing and logistics fields*2, and the development of a field-extended metaverse that runs on Microsoft Teams,\" said Keiji Kojima, President and CEO of Hitachi. \"Under this new agreement, we are excited to further accelerate social innovation by expanding our efforts to social infrastructure areas such as energy and mobility, and by applying generative AI, to improve the productivity of frontline workers, which will become even more important in the future. By combining our capabilities, we can help solve the issues faced by our customers and society, and contribute to a more sustainable future.\"\n\"We are entering a new era of AI with the promise to deliver transformative business outcomes across every role and industry,\" said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. \"Our expanded partnership with Hitachi will bring together the power of the Microsoft Cloud \u2013 including Microsoft Copilot \u2013 with Hitachi\u2019s industry expertise to improve the productivity of 270,000 Hitachi employees and help address customers\u2019 biggest challenges, including sustainability.\"\nHitachi\u2019s Business Transformation\nHitachi\u2019s Generative AI Center*3 and Microsoft will collaborate to improve operational efficiency and application development within the Hitachi Group by using Copilot for Microsoft 365 and GitHub Copilot. Hitachi will also use Azure OpenAI Service to enhance its customer service. As part of Hitachi\u2019s group-wide transformation, Hitachi will combine Azure OpenAI Service and GitHub Copilot with its systems development expertise to maintain high quality and improve productivity for mission-critical system development. Hitachi\u2019s internal validation confirmed that when its detailed system design knowledge was incorporated with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and GitHub Copilot, the application source code could be properly generated 70-90% of the time, resulting in high quality output.*4\nHitachi Rail is leveraging GenAI for predictive maintenance, enhancing equipment monitoring and refining forecast accuracy. This proactive approach prevents breakdowns, increases service quality, reduces operating expenses, and augments safety. For example, a cloud-based platform on Microsoft Azure was utilized to streamline data visualization and analysis, empowered by AI to furnish data-driven insights to digitally monitor rail infrastructure. These insights were translated into actionable steps for Network Rail, enhancing decision-making for predictive maintenance of overhead lines.\nDevelop innovative digital solutions\nHitachi is enhancing its Lumada solutions by incorporating the capability of generative AI. As part pf the initiative, Hitachi has already started to use Microsoft\u2019s Generative AI for JP1 Cloud Services, a SaaS version of JP1, its integrated operations management software with approximately 20 thousand customers. This will accelerate response times to address failures, and enable improved operational efficiencies for IT departments, financial and public institutions. In an internal verification test conducted earlier, Hitachi confirmed that the time required for the operator to make an initial response to an alert was reduced to approximately two-thirds by using generated AI to respond to the alert and displaying the source of the citation, such as a manual, that provided the basis for the response.\nIn addition to this, Hitachi and Microsoft will also support the energy transition with improved access to and strengthening of digital solutions for asset performance management, energy trading, and risk management to reduce downtime and increase profitability. Increased computing power and cloud infrastructure are both critical to scaling these applications. Hitachi Energy\u2019s Enterprise Software Solutions technology and its partnership with Microsoft is key to optimizing the energy network, from generation, through transmission and distribution, and ultimately in delivering reliable and sustainable energy to customers.\nJoint projects to promote sustainable growth\nMultiple Hitachi Group Companies including GlobalLogic, Hitachi Digital Services, and Hitachi Solutions, deliver a wide range of digital engineering, IT & managed services, and application services for the cloud. Additional development efforts through this partnership will focus on enhancing this broad range of services with the aim of sustainable innovation with Microsoft.\nAs the impact of CO2 emissions from AI on the global environment increases, Hitachi and Microsoft will work toward zero carbon, starting with a data center project in Europe, to reduce environmental impact.\nStrengthen digital skilling and talent development\nHitachi will train more than 50 thousand GenAI Professionals. As part of the partnership, Hitachi will incorporate training to acquire advanced software development skills using GitHub Copilot and Azure OpenAI Service into the program to develop GenAI Professional, talents who support customers\u2019 transformation using AI.\n*1\nForecast as of April 26, 2024, calculated at 140 yen to the U.S. dollar.\n*2\nHitachi News Release (June 26, 2020) \"Hitachi and Microsoft form a strategic alliance to advance next-generation digital solutions for manufacturing and logistics across Southeast Asia, North America and Japan\"\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2020/06/200626.html\n*3\nHitachi News Release (May 15, 2023) \"Hitachi Establishes New \u2018Generative AI Center\u2019 to Accelerate Value Creation and Improve Productivity in the Lumada business by promoting the use of Generative AI\"\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2023/05/230515.html\n*4\nHitachi News Release (May 21, 2024)\"Hitachi to Accelerate System Development Transformation with Generative AI\"\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/month/2024/05/240521.html\nAbout Hitachi, Ltd.\nHitachi drives Social Innovation Business, creating a sustainable society through the use of data and technology.

        "Text": "A Shanghai-based artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, founded a year ago by a former vice-president at Microsoft, is betting on so-called \"scaling law\" to enhance its AI capabilities, despite the difficulties in obtaining advanced chips, an executive said.\nChina's demand for higher computing power will be never ending amid the generative AI boom, Zhu Yibo, head of systems at AI start-up StepFun, or Jieyue Xingchen in Chinese, said at a media briefing in Shanghai on Thursday. \"Computing power, systems, data, and algorithms are the cores in the pursuit of the scaling law,\" he added.\nStepFun, founded by Microsoft Asia Research Institute's former chief scientist Jiang Daxin in 2023, is one of the many Chinese AI start-ups trying to catch up with US peers in AI computing power. It has launched the Step-1V multimodal large language model (LLM) with over 100 billion parameters, and it is testing the Step-2V model that boasts over one trillion parameters.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe push for greater computing power stems from a belief in the scaling law, which states that as the size of a model and its training data increases, the model's performance improves. However, Chinese AI start-ups face the common challenge of restricted access to the most advanced AI chips from US supplier Nvidia, making their quest more difficult.\nChina's domestic market has spawned at least 200 LLMs, many claiming to be among the top-performing in the world.

Photo: Shutterstock Images>\nStepFun's computing centre under development in Shanghai is expected to be one of China's leading AI facilities, according to the company. When asked about the impact of Washington's export restrictions on AI chips to China, Zhu said the challenges were \"manageable\", without elaborating.\nThe company has become one of the most recognised AI players in China, partly thanks to the experience of its founder. Jiang worked at Microsoft for 16 years, leading projects such as the Bing search engine, the intelligent voice assistant Cortana, Azure cognitive services, and natural language understanding systems for Microsoft 365.\nThe other founders, Zhu and Jiao Binxing, shared working experiences at Microsoft.\nChina's domestic market has spawned at least 200 LLMs, the technology behind generative AI services like ChatGPT. Many of these claim to be among the top-performing in the world, including offerings from unicorns Zhipu AI, Baichuan, Moonshot AI and Minimax. However, the path to commercialisation of these products remains unclear.\nApart from its two LLMs, StepFun has launched two AI applications: a ChatGPT-like personal assistant called Yuewen, and Maopaoya, a character AI product with gaming features. According to an interview with Jiang in local media outlet 36kr, StepFun will focus on consumer-facing applications.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

However, for serious investors, short-term stock price movements are completely meaningless, but the logic behind the analysts' sentiments can provide valuable insight into what's ahead for the company. Such is the case here.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives maintained a buy rating on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock while increasing his price target to $550, up from $500, noting the company is part of the firm's \"Best Ideas List.\" That represents potential gains for investors of 24% compared to Friday's closing price. Microsoft stock has gained 73% (or 20% annually) over the past three years, so forecasting 24% gains over the coming 12 months isn't that much of a stretch.\nIves cites recent channel checks for his bullish call, saying there's a \"tidal wave of Copilot and Azure monetization now on the doorstep\" for Microsoft. He estimates that artificial intelligence (AI) will generate $25 billion in incremental revenue in fiscal 2025. The analyst's forecast could well be conservative.\nEvercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne and I/O analyst Beth Kindig have both crunched the numbers and estimate AI could be worth $100 billion in incremental revenue for Microsoft by 2027.\nTwo factors could help propel the stock to new heights over the next year. First is Copilot, the company's suite of AI-powered digital assistants that are deeply integrated into the company's products and services. Microsoft charges $30 per user per month to include Copilot access, which essentially doubles the cost of Microsoft 365 for many users.\nAdditionally, Microsoft has seen a \"halo effect\" on its cloud services. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), management noted \"AI services contributed seven points of growth\" to Azure Cloud.\nFinally, at 38 times sales, Microsoft isn't cheap, but I'd argue it's a reasonable price to pay for a company on the cutting edge of AI.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

Smith told the hearings that the words were \"not [his] statement\".\nSmith said there were areas in China deemed by Microsoft as \"appropriate and important\" to participate in, but that he did not use the words in the quote.\nHowever, the quote and Smith's visit to China were widely reported by local media as Beijing seeks to lure more foreign investment in the country.\n\"It's been increasingly hard for American companies to operate in China given the rising geopolitical tension between the two countries,\" said Thomas Liu, founder and CEO of the consultancy Policy Nexus. \"But in the long run, China and the US will benefit from cooperating with each other rather than a conflict.\"\nEven while maintaining its presence on the mainland, Microsoft has been reducing its China-based engineering team. Smith confirmed that the company is offering to relocate 700 to 800 employees from it China operations overseas. The Post reported in May that some local staff, including those from the Azure cloud computing unit, were offered new work locations such as the US, Australia and Ireland.\nPeople walk near a company logo at a Microsoft office building in Beijing, China, 05 August 2020.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of the 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWhen the AI revolution began with the launch of ChatGPT, no one would have thought that down the road it would bring a huge growth catalyst for the PC industry, notorious for its cyclical nature and unpredictability. Fast forward to today, everyone is talking about PCs equipped with AI-focused equipment capable to process generative AI workloads. But in just a matter of few months why did the market feel the need for AI PCs? It all boils down to costs. GPT-4 costs $0.03 per 1,000 tokens for prompts and $0.06 for completion according to Microsoft\u2019s estimates. Consider millions of users prompting LLMs from their phones and computers. The costs of scaling such systems are not feasible. That\u2019s why the market thought allowing users to process AI-intensive workloads natively instead of using the Cloud is the future. And that caused the AI PC boom. Tech market analyst firm Canalys says AI PC shipments are expected to soar to 170 million in 2027, from 25 million in 2022. That would be a 60% share of the total PC market. The firm also expects AI PC shipments to double from 2023 to 2024 and double gain from 2024 to 2025.\nCanalys also expects vendors to ship 205 million AI-capable PCs in 2028, representing a CAGR of 44% from 2024 through 2028.\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 919 hedge funds and picked 8 AI PC stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\nSatya Nadella\u2019s plan to pack AI chips and AI-focused software into special PCs and label them as \u201cAI PCs\u201d was pure genius. Microsoft Corporation\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0announcement of Copilo+PCs seems to have given the struggling PC industry a new life, with several traditional PC players riding the wave. But Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the best AI PC stock because of its moat in the enterprise software space which makes Microsoft Corporation\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0PCs a one-stop solution for anyone looking to own AI-powered machines for using AI-driven software.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOur second largest purchase during the quarter was the software platform,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), which we continued to add to, after initiating a position in the fourth quarter of 2023. Microsoft continues to report strong quarterly results, with revenue growth of 16% year-over-year in constant currency thanks to better-than-expected demand in its intelligent cloud segment, which saw revenue growth of 19% year-over-year, driven by Azure growth of 28% with AI contributing 6pts to growth compared with 3pts in the prior quarter. While the adoption of GenAI remains in its early stages, Microsoft has disclosed positive initial data points with 53,000 Azure AI customers as of its December quarter up from 18,000 in the prior quarter, 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers (up 30% sequentially) and more than 230,000 organizations who have used AI capabilities in the power platform (up 80% sequentially). Management also noted that large cloud optimizations that started a year or so ago have largely finished. Profitability also continues to be strong with 44% non-GAAP operating margins, which was 120bps better than expected.\u201d\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to the company\u2019s integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0earnings to grow 12.50% next year. Based on the growth catalysts mentioned above, the stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\nOverall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. While we acknowledge the potential of meme stocks in a speculative market, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Microsoft Insiders Sell US$82m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Many Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$412 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$415. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 8.7% of Bradford Smith's stake.\nMicrosoft insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Microsoft. Specifically, insiders ditched US$24m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$1.0b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nInsiders haven't bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Microsoft is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Microsoft. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Microsoft that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.\nCloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.\nThe growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.\nCurrently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.\nEven with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.\nThe Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.\nTo shortlist the best cloud computing stocks to buy now, we relied on Insider Monkey\u2019s extensive database of 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Microsoft is cutting hundreds of jobs at its Azure cloud unit, Business Insider reported on Monday, adding to a flurry of layoffs seen in the technology and media industries this year.\nThe layoffs will impact teams including Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering, according to the report. The Azure for Operators layoffs involve as many as 1,500 job cuts, it added, citing people familiar with the situation.\n\"Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business. We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told Reuters.\nThe cuts come after the company shed 1,900 jobs at Activision Blizzard and Xbox in January this year. Tech firms including Amazon.com and Salesforce also laid off several hundred employees in 2024.\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud is witnessing sharp growth due to the company's heavy investment in AI and its access to the coveted technologies of ChatGPT maker OpenAI through their strategic partnership.\nAzure for Operations and Mission Engineering are a part of an organization called Strategic Missions and Technologies formed in 2021 tasked with quantum computing and space, the Business Insider reported.\nSeparately, Microsoft has started restructuring its mixed reality organization but will continue to sell its augmented reality headset, the HoloLens 2, a spokesperson for the company told Reuters on Monday.\nBusiness Insider reported in 2022 that the company scrapped plans for HoloLens 3.\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Maju Samuel)\n"

        "Author": "  Omer Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb and in this article we will discuss the activist investor's position in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nBillionaire investor Dan Loeb's hedge fund Third Point had a strong start to 2024 after its offshore fund posted returns of 7.8% in the first quarter chugging along with the broader market's 10.6% gain. AI has been one of his top investing themes for some time now and the activist shareholder maintains his bullish view on the technology. In the first quarter, he initiated a position in Alphabet and also increased his position in Amazon by 22% to about $920 million.\nLoeb's also bullish on the energy transition and one of his favorite stocks that is expected to benefit from the AI-driven electricity demand is Vistra, one of the largest independent power producers and retail electricity providers in the US. Though Vistra's core markets have experienced volatility due to weak domestic electricity demand, the power company's \"capital allocation strategy has been brilliant\", he stated in his Q1 2024 letter to shareholders, seen by Insider Monkey. In the weak demand environment for fossil fuels, Vistra made smart moves by shutting down its unprofitable coal plants and instead buying back 33% of its shares between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, its acquisition of nuclear generation assets of Ohio-based energy company, Energy Harbor, was right on time as governments are turning to nuclear fuel sources to meet the world's growing energy demands. Loeb expects Vistra to be a direct beneficiary of AI-driven electricity demand and is bullish on the company's unique position of holding both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets under its belt.\nAnother AI play Loeb is increasingly bullish on is UK-based stock exchange and financial data company London Stock Exchange Group. The activist investor likes the company's unique market position as a data provider that is democratizing and making financial data accessible to consumers without the use of additional third-party software. He sees London Stock Exchange Group benefitting from generative AI as information retrieval systems in financial services become more powerful. He also expects the company to develop \"a powerful Research Assistant application\" with Microsoft to reduce both human resources and time needed to process financial data. He thinks London Stock Exchange Group is at the forefront of capitalizing on the transition of the financial services industry \"from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing\".\nPixabay/Public Domain\nOur Methodology\nWe scanned Third Point\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings.

        "Author": "  KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Microsoft violated European Union antitrust rules with \u201cpossibly abusive\u201d practices by tying its Teams messaging and videoconferencing app to its widely used business software, the bloc said.\nThe European Commission said Monday it informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that the U.S. tech giant has been \u201crestricting competition\u201d by bundling Teams with core office productivity applications such as Office 365 and Microsoft 365.\nThe commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said it suspects Microsoft might have granted Teams a \u201cdistribution advantage\u201d by not giving customers a choice on whether to have Teams when they purchased the software. The advantage might have been widened by limits on the ability of rival messaging apps to work with Microsoft software, it said.\n\u201cWe are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president for competition policy, said in a statement.\n\u201cAnd preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets.\u201d\nThe commission took aim at Microsoft a day after accusing Apple of breaching the bloc's new digital competition rulebook, in a flurry of regulatory action underlining Brussels' leading role as a watchdog for Big Tech companies.\nMicrosoft made some changes last year in an effort to head off an penalty, including offering the software packages without Teams for European customers. But the commission said Tuesday the changes are not enough to address its concerns and that it needs to do more to \"restore competition.\"\n\u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2018s remaining concerns.\u201d Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a prepared statement.\nIn April, the company also gave customers worldwide the option to get Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams. The two software suites include programs like Word, Excel and Outlook.\nMicrosoft now has a chance to respond to the accusations, formally known as a statement of objections, before the commission makes its final decision. The company could face a fine worth up to 10% of its annual global revenue, or be forced to carry out \u201cremedies\" to satisfy the competition concerns.\nThe commission opened its investigation in July 2023 after rival Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint with Brussels. Alfaview, which makes videoconferencing software, also filed a separate complaint.\nSlack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, had alleged that Microsoft abused its market dominance to eliminate competition \u2014 in violation of EU laws.\n\u201cThe Statement of Objections issued today by the European Commission is a win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft\u2019s practices with Teams have harmed competition,\u201d Salesforce President Sabastian Niles said. \u201cWe appreciate the Commission\u2019s thorough investigation of Slack\u2019s complaint and urge the Commission to move towards a swift, binding, and effective remedy that restores free and fair choice and promotes competition, interoperability, and innovation in the digital ecosystem.\u201d\n"

        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "Microsoft is scaling back the mixed reality group that manufactures its five-year old headset, the HoloLens 2, in the latest sign that the technology is failing to live up to its promise.\nThe untethered device that retails starting at $3,500 first hit the market in 2019, a full five years before the similarly priced Apple Vision Pro. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was so convinced devices like it would be the future of the social media giant that he renamed his company Meta in late 2021 and since sunk $45 billion into its Reality Labs division.\nYet neither his Meta Quest 3 headset, nor Microsoft\u2019s more enterprise-focused HoloLens 2 before it, have moved the needle. The heavily-hyped Apple Vision Pro is already meeting with less than sterling demand in the U.S., according to\u00a0recent analyst estimates.\n\u201cEarlier today, we announced a restructuring of Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality organization,\u201d a spokesman said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0to\u00a0The Verge.\nWhile the company elected to continue selling the HoloLens 2, it left its development path unclear, saying only that it would continue to invest in Windows365 \u201cto reach the broader Mixed Reality hardware ecosystem\u201d.\nWhen the HoloLens 2 first debuted, Microsoft\u00a0predicted\u00a0\u201cthere\u2019s no competition for the next two or three years that can come close to this level of fidelity.\u201d But the very ecosystem it sought to seed has proven more shallow than broad as weak demand for the actual devices themselves acts as an effective deterrent against greater developer interest.\nBy late 2022, the Wall Street Journal was reporting of deep-seated problems for Microsoft's mixed reality headset, which blends the physical and digital world. Only some 300,000 units had been sold cumulatively in the seven years since the first generation launched, according to estimates from market researcher International Data Corporation, and more than 100 employees left the team.\n\u201cWe had the opportunity to own this market,\u201c Tim Osborne, a former director on the HoloLens team at the time, told the newspaper. But Microsoft didn\u2019t put enough people or money behind the effort, he said.\nFortune contacted the company for a comment on the precise number of jobs affected and the rationale for the cost cuts, but officials have not yet responded.\nGlobal shipments for augmented reality and virtual reality headsets across the industry dropped by nearly a quarter last year, IDC\u00a0figures showed\u00a0in March.\n\u201c2023 began in much the same way that 2022 ended: with a series of significant year-over-year declines,\u201d said Ramon Llamas, research director with IDC\u2019s Augmented and Virtual Reality program. (Thanks to the arrival of the Apple Vision Pro, IDC\u00a0forecasts\u00a0a 44% recovery this year to 9.7 million units.)\nMR headsets have suffered from the perceptions that they are too heavy and aesthetically unappealing to justify their premium prices in a world that already has a vast array of useful smartphone apps to help with our daily tasks. Moreover, older VR headsets that offer no camera-enabled passthrough have earned a reputation for provoking motion sickness.\nThe Microsoft restructuring comes just as the U.S. Army, its largest customer, enters final testing this year of its Integrated Visual Augmentation System (or IVAS) mixed reality headset, which is based on the HoloLens 2.\nIn September, Brigadier General Christopher Schneider\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0Army Times\u00a0that phase II development of the device had been approved after initial problems related to cumbersome cabling, image distortion and moisture control had been rectified.\n\u201cWe remain fully committed to the Department of Defense\u2019s IVAS program,\u201d Microsoft added in its statement.\nThe software company founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen hasn\u2019t had the most successful record when it comes to devices. Products like the Zune MP3 player and Lumia smartphone\u00a0flopped\u00a0while even the more successful Xbox gaming console is\u00a0trailing its two main competitors.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft MSFT has been accused of breaching antitrust rules with the \u201cabusive\u201d bundling of its Teams and Office products by the European Union (EU) regulators.In a preliminary finding, EU officials stated that Microsoft has breached the bloc's competition rules by bundling Teams with its popular Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites for businesses.The potential consequences for Microsoft are significant, with the company facing a possible fine of up to 10% of its global annual revenues, a staggering amount of $211.9 billion in revenues reported for fiscal 2023.The investigation, initiated nearly a year ago, stems from a 2020 complaint by Slack, now owned by Salesforce CRM. Slack alleged that Microsoft's practice of automatically including Teams with its Office software suite gave the communication tool an unfair advantage, stifling competition in the market for remote communication and collaboration tools.The European Commission's preliminary findings suggest that Microsoft's practices may have restricted customer choice and hindered innovation. Specifically, the EU body is concerned that Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically bundling it with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites since at least April 2019. Furthermore, the Commission believes that interoperability limitations between Teams' competitors and Microsoft's offerings may have exacerbated the situation.In response to earlier concerns, Microsoft had already taken steps to unbundle Teams from its productivity suites in Europe and globally. (Read More: Microsoft Splits Teams and Office to Counter EU Scrutiny)However, the Commission deemed these changes insufficient, stating that \"more changes to Microsoft's conduct are necessary to restore competition.\" As the investigation proceeds, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how software suites are packaged and sold in Europe, potentially affecting millions of users and reshaping the competitive landscape in the business productivity software market.\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\nThis case highlights the EU's ongoing efforts to regulate major technology companies, with recent actions against Microsoft, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, highlighting the bloc's determination to ensure fair competition in the digital marketplace.Shares of Microsoft have gained 19% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s growth of 22.4%, 28.4% and 8.1%, respectively. These cases underscore the growing tension between the EU's regulatory ambitions and the business practices of dominant platform providers.Simultaneously, Apple finds itself grappling with multiple regulatory challenges in the EU. The company faces its first charges under the bloc's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), accused of preventing app developers from directing users to cheaper options outside the App Store. This action strikes at the heart of Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem and could have far-reaching implications for its business model.Google is also facing increased scrutiny from EU regulators. The company is under investigation for potentially non-compliant measures related to the DMA's provisions against self-preferencing. The European Commission has expressed concerns that Google's current practices may not treat third-party services fairly in search results, a core issue in the ongoing debate about the power of dominant search engines.Furthermore, the European Commission has launched a new investigation into Apple's support for alternative iOS marketplaces, including the company's controversial core technology fee for developers. In response to these regulatory pressures, AAPL has taken the drastic step of announcing the blockage of certain features, including Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing, for EU users, citing security concerns related to DMA compliance.For Microsoft, the outcome of this investigation could have far-reaching consequences. If found in violation of EU antitrust rules, the company not only faces potential financial penalties but may also be forced to make significant changes to its product strategy and distribution model in Europe.Looking ahead, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company will need to carefully navigate its product development and marketing strategies to align with evolving regulatory expectations, not just in Europe but potentially worldwide.

        "Title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +5.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 4.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nMicrosoft is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.77 points to a change of +20% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.18 indicates a change of +12% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $64.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.2%. The $244.41 billion and $278.17 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.3% and +13.8%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $61.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17%. EPS of $2.94 for the same period compares with $2.45 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $60.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.02%. The EPS surprise was +4.63%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Is It Worth Investing in Microsoft (MSFT) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT).\nMicrosoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 89.7% and 7.7% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MSFT\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>The ABR suggests buying Microsoft, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs MSFT a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $11.77.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft.

        "Author": "  Stephen Nellis ",
        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - Microsoft on Tuesday said it will introduce new artificial intelligence tools for customer service call centers.\nMicrosoft, which has backed ChatGPT creator OpenAI, is taking AI technology into a number of fields of the business world with what it calls Copilot technology, which is capable of summarizing emails and crafting PowerPoint slides as part of the company's Office software package.\nBut by taking Copilot to call centers, Microsoft will be putting its technology into a field where it is not the dominant player, hoping to gain ground against rivals such as Salesforce.com and Zoom.\nFor customer support tasks, the new AI tool will be able to scour a company's help manuals and materials to train chatbots with better answers to questions that customers might ask in a chat window. Many of those tasks are already automated, and Microsoft's hope is to make them better, said Jeff Comstock, corporate vice president of Dynamics 365 Customer Service at Microsoft.\nBut the real benefit is expected to be to human customer service agents fielding phone calls. Those agents are often sitting at a computer with multiple applications open at once - many of them outdated and slow - while trying to find the information to help the customer.\nComstock said the Microsoft tools will aim to take in all of that information so that customer service agents can navigate the apps they need with natural language to get answers faster and easier.\n\"The service space is, unfortunately, just rife with toil and drudgery. There's tons of tools, and they have to use lots of processes just to do the most basic sort of tasks. It's a brutal experience,\" Comstock said. \"And so, our goal is to help them in the flow of work to reduce that toil and drudgery.\"\nMicrosoft said the new contact center software will become available on July 1.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "In a groundbreaking development, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has overtaken Microsoft Corporation MSFT to become the most valuable company in the world. This milestone underscores NVIDIA's robust market position and the burgeoning demand for its innovative technologies.\nNVIDIA achieved this milestone in just two weeks after its valuation crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time ever earlier this month, which aided it in taking the number two spot from Apple Inc. AAPL. It took NVIDIA just around three months to attain the $3 trillion milestone from the $2 trillion market capitalization as of Mar 1, 2024.\nNVDA stock rose 3.5% during yesterday\u2019s intraday trading session and closed at $135.58, reaching its market capitalization of $3.335 trillion. Microsoft slipped to the second position with a market cap of $3.317 trillion, while Apple continues to be in the third spot with a market value of $3.286 trillion.\nNVIDIA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a whopping 175.1% surge in its stock price year to date. The stock has outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s year-to-date growth of 118.8%. The surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions.\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nNVIDIA's impressive stock performance has largely been fueled by expectations that the company will significantly benefit from the increasing investments in generative AI. With its leading position in this space and the numerous opportunities generative AI presents, NVIDIA's stock appears set to maintain its momentum throughout the year.\nThe rising demand for workflow modernization across various industries is anticipated to boost the need for generative AI applications. According to a recent report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nHowever, generative AI requires extensive knowledge for content creation and substantial computational power. Consequently, enterprises aiming to develop generative AI-based applications will need to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA's next-generation chips, known for their high computing power, are likely to become the preferred choice for enterprises. The company's GPUs are already being utilized in AI models, which is broadening NVIDIA's presence in emerging markets such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nThe generative AI revolution is expected to generate significant demand for NVIDIA's next-generation, high-computing power chips. Given the rising AI investments in the data center sector, NVIDIA anticipates its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to soar to $28 billion, up from $13.51 billion in the same quarter the previous year.\nNVIDIA's robust product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity. It enjoys high market esteem, and astute investors should consider leveraging NVDA's potential for sustained long-term growth.\nNVIDIA boasts an impressive long-term expected earnings growth rate of 37.6%, significantly outpacing the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry's growth rate of 18.9%. The company's earnings have consistently exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 18.4%.\nFinancially, NVIDIA is on solid ground, with ample cash reserves that provide a cushion against market volatility. As of Apr 28, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $31.44 billion, up from $25.98 billion on Jan 28, 2024.\nHowever, NVIDIA's stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.99, which is significantly higher than the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry's forward P/S multiple of 20.80. While this might be perceived as a risk, we believe the premium is warranted due to NVIDIA's consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and currently boasts a Growth Score of A, making it a highly attractive investment option, according to Zacks' proprietary methodology.\nAnother top-ranked stock from the broader technology sector is Datadog, Inc. DDOG. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nCurrently, the long-term expected earnings growth rate of Datadog is an impressive 9.6%.

The firm said it would take \"additional measures\" to block attempts from those regions to access its AI models via application programming interfaces (APIs), starting July 9.\nAn API is software that allows two computer programs to communicate with each other.\nOpenAI's services, which have been introduced in over 188 countries and regions, are officially unavailable in mainland China and Hong Kong, where users often access popular models such as ChatGPT through virtual private networks or third-party apps, while developers turn to proxies and outbound servers to bypass restrictions.\nThe San Francisco-based start-up did not elaborate on the reasons behind its latest move, which comes as the US government is ramping up efforts to cut off China's access to advanced AI technology, citing national security concerns.\nBesides sweeping export curbs on advanced chips, Washington is also looking into ways to limit China's use of computing power offered by US cloud providers to train AI models and support related applications.\nMicrosoft launched enterprise support for OpenAI models in Hong Kong in March last year, allowing developers to apply for access to a range of systems including GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, Codex and DALL-E 2.\nOn the mainland, authorities have approved 117 home-grown large language models - the technology behind ChatGPT and other generative AI services - for public release. Industry insiders and analysts have said OpenAI's service ban on China-based developers is set to push users towards domestic platforms.\nBeijing-based Zhipu AI, considered one of the country's top OpenAI alternatives, announced a \"special house-moving plan\" to help China-based OpenAI users \"easily switch to home-grown [LLMs]\", according to a post published on its WeChat account.\nOther start-ups such as Baichuan and 01.ai, as well as Big Tech companies like Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu, are also dangling perks ranging from steep discounts to freebies to draw developers affected by OpenAI's new measures.\nAlibaba owns the Post.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "Adept, a two-year old AI startup that has raised more than $400 million in funding, has been in talks with Microsoft, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Microsoft, an investor in Adept who has a commercial agreement with the startup, said that the software maker has no plans to acquire Adept.\n\"We have zero intent to purchase the company in whole or in part,\" Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw told Fortune shortly after this story was published.\nTwo of the sources told Fortune that Adept has received and signed a term sheet from Microsoft, though the specifics and financial value could not be learned. The deal was not a standard acquisition, according to both sources, one of whom learned about the deal from a high-ranking Adept insider with direct knowledge of the matter.\nMicrosoft has moved aggressively to transform itself into an AI powerhouse in recent years. The software giant has invested $13 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and made smaller investments in several other startups including France's Mistral. In March, it hired the senior leadership team of Inflection AI, a buzzy startup working on AI chatbots.\nAdept was founded in 2022 by veterans of OpenAI and Google, including several co-authors of a now famous 2017 research paper that created the kind of neural network architecture, known as a transformer, on which most of the generative AI boom has been built.\nWhile Adept debuted a flashy demo of its product in 2022, it has struggled to gain major commercial customers for its software. In late 2022, two of the Adept cofounders, Ashish Vaswani and Niki Parmar, left to launch their own startup, Essential AI, which has been pursuing a similar idea of using transformers to create AI agents that would be useful to business. In May, The Information reported that Adept was exploring a possible sale or strategic partnership with companies including Meta.\nAdept was founded on the idea of using transformers\u2014but not to generate text, as is the case for the large language models (LLMs) that underpin consumer chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Instead, Adept planned to use transformers to create an AI assistant for business, one that could automate any workflow and use any business software to perform tasks. These might range from extracting figures from documents and putting them into a spreadsheet, to then running analysis of financial figures and creating charts and graphs, and then generating a power point sales deck based on the analysis.\nAdept, like Inflection, is backed by Silicon Valley VC firm Greylock Partners. Both startups also received investments from Microsoft. According to a March 2023 Forbes report citing anonymous sources, Adept was valued at \"at least\" $1 billion when it raised $350 million in its Series B round from General Catalyst and Spark Capital.\nIf Microsoft were to use a similar deal structure with Adept to the one it used for Inflection, that could prove controversial. Microsoft hired Inflection cofounder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman in March, along with most of its research scientists and AI engineers, but did not formally acquire the company. Instead, it paid Inflection's investors a $650 million fee to license the right to Inflection's technology. It did so even though Microsoft said it had little interest in the products Inflection had built. A Microsoft spokesperson said at the time that the payment was necessary to make Inflection's investors' whole and preempt any lawsuits on the grounds the employees joining Microsoft were somehow stealing Inflection's trade secrets. Microsoft denied critics who said the structure had another purpose\u2014to avoid having the deal blocked by antitrust regulators.\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into the Microsoft-Inflection deal. But the U.K. competition authority decided, after a preliminary investigation, that it could not take any action against Microsoft for the deal because it was not structured as a traditional acquisition.\nUpdate: This story has been updated to include Microsoft's comment that it has no interest in acquiring Adept.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": " Alexis Keenan    \u00b7 Senior Legal Reporter",
        "Text": "The biggest antitrust regulators in the US are stepping up their scrutiny of the nation\u2019s most powerful developers of artificial intelligence.\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched and divided up investigations of Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI, according to reporting from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.\nThe DOJ will lead a probe of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) dominance in the market for microprocessors that power AI, according to the Times. The FTC would lead antitrust investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI.\nThe new scrutiny is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\nIt also took to trial a case filed by the Trump administration over Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) dominance in search. A judge is currently weighing the evidence in that case, with a decision expected this year.\nThe efforts have not always been successful. The FTC failed in its challenge against Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and fell short in a separate battle to prevent Meta (META) from being able to purchase VR company Within.\nThe FTC made it clear last year that it wanted to look a lot closer at the burgeoning field of AI, though its precise markets of concern within the AI landscape have not been made clear.\nIf regulators do assert antitrust violations, they would first need to prove to a judge that they've identified a relevant market, the products or services at the heart of a claim.\n\"DOJ and FTC are notorious for not divulging the specifics of what they're focusing on and where they are in an investigation,\" antitrust attorney David Reichenberg, a partner with Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, told Yahoo Finance.\nIt's common, Reichenberg said, for regulators to worry about competition when one company controls a resource that's in such demand that it becomes an \"essential facility\" \u2014 a product or service considered necessary for market competition.\nAnd it's possible here that regulators want to ensure that Nvidia's semiconductors, which are required for leading AI development, remain widely accessible at a reasonable price.\nWhat the FTC said last July that it had started a consumer protection-based investigation into OpenAI\u2019s data collection practices and potential harms caused by the output of its large language models (LLMs).\nThen, in January, it began a broader inquiry into deals between Big Tech and AI developers, including Microsoft\u2019s $13 billion investment in OpenAI and Alphabet\u2019s relationship with rival AI developer Anthropic.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC\u2019s probe of Microsoft will extend beyond an examination of the tech giant's conduct to include a deal it reached with AI developer Inflection AI.\nAccording to the Journal, the FTC wants to know why Microsoft chose to pay Inflection a $650 million licensing fee to resell Inflection's technology, rather than buy it. The regulator's interest was piqued, according to the report, because Microsoft also acquired most of Inflection\u2019s staff as part of the accord.\nIn response to the report, Microsoft\u2019s spokesperson said the agreements with Inflection gave it an opportunity to recruit Inflection AI staff and accelerate the development of its AI chat interface Microsoft Copilot.\nThat structure, Microsoft said, enables Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio.\n\"We take our legal obligations to report transactions under the HSR Act seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations,\" the spokesperson said.\nBoth companies received subpoenas from the FTC asking for information tied to the deal, the Journal reported.\nNvidia declined to comment on the reports.\nMichael Carrier, an antitrust expert and co-director of Rutgers Institute for Information Policy and Law, said antitrust regulators looking to test the Microsoft agreement against antitrust laws will look to the substance and not the structure of the deal.\n\"The agency will try to determine whether Microsoft restructured this deal in a way that gave it control of InflectionAI while avoiding FTC review of the transaction,\" Carrier said.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "AI titans Microsoft and Nvidia reportedly had a standoff over Microsoft's use of B200 AI GPUs in its own server rooms",
        "Author": "  Aaron Klotz ",
        "Text": "Nvidia is well known for its high-performance gaming GPUs and industry-leading AI GPUs. However, the trillion-dollar GPU manufacturer is also known for controlling how its GPUs are used beyond company walls. For example, it can be quite restrictive with its AIB partners' graphics card designs. Perhaps not surprisingly, this level of control also appears to extend beyond card partners over to AI customers, including Microsoft. The Information reports that there was a standoff between Microsoft and Nvidia over how Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs were to be installed in Microsoft's server rooms.  Nvidia has been aggressively pursuing ever larger pieces of the data center pie, which is immediately clear if you look at how it announced the Blackwell B200 parts. Multiple times during the presentation, Jensen Huang indicated that he doesn't think about individual GPUs any more \u2014 he thinks of the entire NVL72 rack as a GPU. It's a rather transparent effort to gain additional revenue from its AI offerings, and that extends to influencing how customers install their new B200 GPUs.  Previously, the customer was responsible for buying and building appropriate server racks to house the hardware. Now, Nvidia is pushing customers to buy individual racks and even entire SuperPods \u2014 all coming direct from Nvidia. Nvidia claims this will boost GPU performance, and there's merit to such talk considering all the interlinks between the various GPUs, servers, racks, and even SuperPods. But there's also a lot of dollar bills changing hands when you're building data centers at scale.  Nvidia's smaller customers might be ok with the company's offerings, but Microsoft wasn't. VP of Nvidia Andrew Bell reportedly asked Microsoft to buy a server rack design specifically for its new B200 GPUs that boasted a form factor a few inches different from Microsoft's existing server racks that are actively used in its data centers.  Microsoft pushed back on Nvidia's recommendation, revealing that the new server racks would prevent Microsoft from easily switching between Nvidia's AI GPUs and competing offerings such as AMD's MI300X GPUs. Nvidia eventually backed down and allowed Microsoft to use its own custom server racks for its B200 AI GPUs, but it's probably not the last such disagreement we'll see between the two megacorps.  To be clear, Nvidia supports both OCP's Open Rack (21-inch) and standard 19-inch EIA racks for MGX. Microsoft appears to use OCP racks, which are newer and should be better for density. Microsoft likely has a lot of existing infrastructure that continues to work well, and upgrading all of that would be quite expensive.  A dispute like this this is a sign of how large and valuable Nvidia has become over the span of just a year. Nvidia became the most valuable company earlier this week (briefly), and that title will likely change hands many times in the coming months and years. Server racks aren't the only area Nvidia wants to control, as the tech giant also controls how much GPU inventory gets allocated to each customer to maintain demand, and it's using its dominant position in the AI space to push its own software and networking systems to maintain its position as a market leader.  Nvidia is benefiting massively from the AI boom, which started when ChatGPT exploded in popularity one and a half years ago. Over that same timespan, Nvidia's AI-focused GPUs have become the GPU manufacturer's most in-demand and highest income generating products, leading to incredible financial success. Stock prices for Nvidia have soared and are currently over eight times higher than they were at the beginning of 2023, and over 2.5 times higher than at the start of 2024.  Nvidia continues to use all of this extra income to great effect. Its latest AI GPU, the Blackwell B200, will be the fastest graphics processing unit in the world for AI workloads. A \"single\" GB200 Superchip delivers up to a whopping 20 petaflops of compute performance (for sparse FP8) and is theoretically five times faster than its H200 predecessor. Of course GB200 is actually two B200 GPUs plus a Grace CPU all on a large daughterboard, and the B200 uses two large dies linked together for good measure. The 'regular' B200 GPU on the other hand only offers up to 9 petaflops FP4 (with sparsity), but even so that's a lot of number crunching prowess. It also delivers up to 2.25 petaflops of dense compute for FP16/BF16, which is what's used in AI training workloads.  As of June 20th, 2024, Nvidia stock has dropped slightly from its $140.76 high and closed at $126.57. We'll have to see what happens once Blackwell B200 begins shipping en masse. In the meantime, Nvidia continues to go all-in on AI.\n"

Microsoft even admitted it: There are too many meetings. And rather than solving this problem through apps and tools, Turner said, Microsoft Copilot is at best a treatment to a symptom of a systemic issue\u2014and at worst, enables a massive workplace culture flaw.\n\u201cMicrosoft Copilot is solving a micro-problem that emerged as a result of all of these other factors that are creating so many meetings,\u201d she told Fortune. \u201cYou can see how that doesn't really solve the overall systemic problem with too many meetings. It just allows people to go to more meetings. Because three\u2014why stop at three?\u201d\nTech companies are already starting to push the boundaries of what AI is capable of in meetings. Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan is hoping to create an AI avatar, or \u201cdigital twin,\u201d to attend meetings on behalf of employees. The feature would eventually be able to respond to most emails and answer calls, Yuan said.\n\u201cYou and I can have more time to have more in-person interactions, but maybe not for work,\u201d Eric Yuan told The Verge earlier this month. \u201cWhy not spend more time with your family? Why not focus on some more creative things, giving you back your time, giving back to the community and society to help others, right?\u201d\nBut Turner argued these AI bots are enabling attendees to zone out: \u201cNo one has ever wanted to be in a meeting,\u201d she said. With more excuses to not pay attention, there\u2019s \u201cmore and more of a disconnect between this relationship between people and what they're talking about.\u201d\nFrom a managerial perspective, zoned-out meeting attendees not only miss out on spontaneous watercooler interactions that promote workplace bonding, but also the magic of riffing off employees to unravel a challenging problem and create unique solutions.\n\u201cA lot of the serendipitous task-like conversation is not happening,\u201d she said.\nBeyond the interpersonal disconnect is the potential for a logistical nightmare, Turner said. Sure, your AI double may be taking thorough notes, but now you, the employee or a manager has to actually go through all those notes. Without having attended the meeting in person, they also have no idea which bullet points on that meeting summary are the most important. What comes next in this confusion spiral\u2014recruiting AI tools to decipher which parts of the AI-generated notes summary are most important?\n\u201cNow we're getting more and more disconnected from our work,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThey are really just perpetuating the madness,\u201d she added.\nNot only are AI bots potentially harmful to workplace connection, they also perpetuate the pandemic-era problem of overly abundant meetings that remain deeply ingrained in workplace culture post-pandemic. Turning to Zoom and other digital productivity tools in March 2020 was a split-second decision for many managers made out of necessity, but it\u2019s not a necessity now.\n\u201cWe had 48 hours, basically\u2026[to] figure out how to address the fact that we couldn't be in person anymore,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe solved that\u2014in a time of global crisis\u2014with Band-Aid solutions.\u201d\nThese temporary solutions have become problems in their own right: Not only did the onslaught of remote meetings balloon\u2014to the tune of 300 million daily Zoom users by April 2020\u2014but those meetings are not guaranteed to be a source of productivity. About 30% of employees complete unrelated work tasks during Zoom meetings, like responding to emails or editing a document. Retailer Asos blamed its virtual meetings on the company\u2019s sluggish post-COVID recovery, it told employees in an internal correspondence this week.\nMeetings have lost their potency and power, Turner argued, because they are happening with frequency\u2014but not urgency.\n\u201cWe're using them as a mechanism for kicking the can down the road, when we really should have been thinking, What is it we're doing that requires a meeting?\u201d she said.\nCopilot\u2019s promise of relieving workers of mundane tasks may fall short of solving workplaces\u2019 meeting crisis, but it can still provide useful tools, Turner said: For one, it likely takes better notes than employees, and for workers with different learning and communication styles, such as conflict-averse people, those thorough notes can be a way to follow-up with a manager or co-worker about a particular issue.\nThe systemic problems caused by so many meetings means that programs like Copilot aren\u2019t inherently harmful to workplace culture,Turner suggested, but they require intention to make them truly effective. This is an uphill battle: Managers don\u2019t have a track record of intentionally scheduling meetings over Zoom, so why would they start being intentional in figuring out how to introduce shortcut technologies like AI bots?\n\u201cIt absolutely can be [an efficient] time-solver,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt's just that once again, we have to be thoughtful and careful of how it's used.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Jody Godoy ",
        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal that clears the way for potential antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia play in the artificial intelligence industry, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nThe agreement between the two agencies shows regulatory scrutiny is gathering steam amid concerns over concentration in the industries that make up AI. Microsoft and Nvidia not only dominate their industries but are two of the world's biggest companies by market capitalization since Nvidia's market value recently surpassed $3 trillion.\nU.S. antitrust enforcers have publicly expressed a range of concerns around AI, from the advantage that Big Tech companies have in their access to data used to train AI models, to how generative AI affects the market for creative work, to partnerships between companies potentially being used to sidestep required merger review processes.\nThe move to divvy up the industry mirrors a similar agreement between the two agencies in 2019 to divide enforcement against Big Tech, which ultimately saw the FTC bring cases against Meta and Amazon, and the DOJ sue Apple and Google for alleged violations. Those cases are ongoing and the companies have denied wrongdoing.\nWhile OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a 49% stake.\nThe Justice Department will take the lead in investigating whether Nvidia violated antitrust laws, while the FTC will examine the conduct of OpenAI and Microsoft.\nThe regulators struck the deal over the past week, and it is expected to be completed in the coming days, the person said.\nNvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the custom AI processors made by the cloud computing companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com. That domination helps the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%.\nSpokespersons for Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment on the regulators' agreement on Thursday. Microsoft said it takes its legal obligations to report transactions seriously and is confident it has complied with them.\nThe agreement between the two regulators comes after the FTC in January ordered OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Anthropic to provide information on recent investments and partnerships involving generative AI companies and cloud service providers.\nIn July last year, the FTC opened an investigation into OpenAI on claims it had run afoul of consumer protection laws by putting personal reputations and data at risk.\nLast week, Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said at an AI conference at Stanford University that there are \"structures and trends in AI that should give us pause,\" adding that the technology relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already dominant firms a substantial advantage.\nThe DOJ and FTC, led by Chair Lina Khan, share jurisdiction to enforce federal competition law but avoid duplicative investigations.\nBill Baer, who led antitrust efforts at the agencies during the Obama and Clinton administrations, said that typically each agency will take the lead in areas where it has amassed expertise. But occasionally the heads of the two agencies will sit down and iron out who does what, said Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nMICROSOFT DEAL\nThe FTC is also looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI, over concerns as to whether the deal was a play to skirt merger disclosure requirements, the person said.\nThe unusual deal reached in March allowed Microsoft to use Inflection's models and hire most of the startup's staff, including its co-founders.\nMicrosoft said in a statement on Monday that the agreement with Inflection helped it accelerate work on Microsoft Copilot, while still allowing Inflection \"to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio.\"\nThe probe was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and the regulators' agreement on AI by the New York Times.\n(Reporting by Gnaneshwar Rajan in Bengaluru and Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala, Chizu Nomiyama and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft\u2019s chief scientist: Step aside, prompt engineers\u2014AI will start prompting you instead",
        "Author": "  Jaime Teevan ",
        "Text": "Jaime Teevan is chief scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft.\nMillions of users have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome the blank page problem\u2014that feeling of uncertainty we all know when faced with an expanse of white that seems to demand perfection from the very first word.\nHowever, a year into integrating LLMs into our productivity tools, we seem to have created a new blank page to scratch our heads at: the prompt box.\nPrompting is how people tell an AI tool what they want it to do. You\u2019re not alone if you find a blank prompt box overwhelming. Even though we\u2019ve been using natural language to communicate our whole lives, we need to talk to large-language models differently than we talk to other people, often in unintuitive ways. What\u2019s more, the best way to prompt constantly evolves as the underlying models improve, meaning that even if you arrive at a prompt strategy that works well today, it might not work tomorrow. And that\u2019s assuming you already know what you want to use AI for\u2014these new models are so capable that it\u2019s hard to even imagine all of the things they can potentially do.\nIn my role as chief scientist at Microsoft, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to help people prompt better, whether it\u2019s by discovering successful practices that can get turned into training materials or making it easy for people to share good prompts. However, my long-term goal isn\u2019t really to help people figure out how to get the most out of AI\u2014it\u2019s to use AI to help people get the most out of themselves. This means that rather than expecting everyone to ask AI exactly the right question, phrased exactly the right way, AI really needs to be prompting us.\nMy prediction for the next big AI-driven change: Our computers are going to start asking us questions! This will help us prompt better, articulate our thoughts more clearly, and even open new perspectives to explore.\nThe most obvious questions we\u2019ll start to see from AI are follow-up questions. Nobody ever really provides enough context on their own when they first ask for something. If somebody were to ask you to create a slide deck from a document, for example, you wouldn\u2019t just go away and create that deck, you\u2019d first ask for some additional information. \u201cWho\u2019s your audience for this?\u201d you might say, or \u201cHow much detail do you want to include?\u201d\nSimilarly, AI shouldn\u2019t just create a deck for you when you ask it to without first learning a little more about what you want.\nThe process of working with someone to arrive at a shared understanding is called \u201cgrounding.\u201d In fact, a significant part of any conversation between people typically consists of grounding.\nWhen an AI system pulls background information into the prompt in the process of generating a reply, we now use the term \u201cgrounding\u201d for that as well. For example, if an AI tool does a web search to help answer a question you have, we say that the answer is grounded in the search results. But rather than always trying to figure out how to ground a conversation by finding what it needs on its own, AI should sometimes ground the old-fashioned way\u2014by asking for clarification.\nResearch suggests many of the prompts people use are too vague or broad to produce good replies, and that having the AI ask clarifying questions can improve outcomes. Of course, the questions an AI system asks might not look exactly like the questions a person would ask, because the questions will target the kind of information AI needs to produce high-quality replies. Generative AI does a lot better producing ideas when given an example of what you are looking for. If you want, say, a list of ideas for a catchy title, a particularly valuable thing for AI to do would be to ask you for an example.\nQuestions can do more than just get at what we already know\u2014they can also spur new ways of thinking. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion recently about how AI can help people do things faster and more efficiently, and research consistently shows significant productivity gains when people use AI to do the things they tell it to, like writing a first draft or summarizing an article. However, AI can be even more useful when we use it not just to obey us but also to challenge us.\nOne of my favorite ways to use AI is to get a fresh perspective. When summarizing an article I prompt, \u201cWhat questions should I ask?\u201d When writing a hard email, I ask how my message might land with different stakeholders. This is really me instructing the AI to ask me the kind of questions that can push me to refine my arguments and inspire me to come up with ideas I hadn\u2019t even considered.\nIn fact, while writing this article, I asked, \u201cWhat counterpoints might I have missed?\u201d which led to the model asking me how I thought the limitations of AI might \u201caffect the quality of interaction and the relevance of the questions it asks?\u201d The cool thing about questions is they don\u2019t need to be perfect to get us thinking\u2014and this question made me think about how people need to be prepared to engage with AI critically and capture some of the most interesting opportunities. We have to be open to having our ideas challenged, and willing to challenge the AI in return. And if we get that right, we will create a two-way street of inquiry that drives us toward growth and discovery.\nAs AI starts asking us questions, this will not only make the conversations we have with our computers better, but it\u2019s also likely to make our conversations with other people better. Imagine, for example, how much more interesting your meetings would be if you knew the most effective questions to discuss so as to make the best possible use of your time together.\nIn the early days when we first started building Copilot, we had very limited model access because it was brand new and the necessary infrastructure hadn\u2019t yet been stood up. It was clear, however, that our products needed to figure out how they were going to integrate the new model capabilities as quickly as possible. So I set up a daily call with representatives from the various product teams, such as Word, Outlook, and Teams, where I\u2019d screen-share the prompt box and we\u2019d collaboratively try more and more creative prompts to see what the model might produce. These group sessions were just a hack to make progress, but they ended up being really valuable because each team was able to learn from the questions the other teams asked.\nNow, everyone can have the model in the meeting with them. And this makes it possible for all of us to use AI to intentionally spark valuable conversations like the ones we had when first playing around with it. Next time you\u2019re in a Teams meeting, try out one of the pre-populated suggested prompts like, \u201cSuggest follow-up questions,\u201d \u201cWhat questions are unresolved?\u201d or \u201cList different perspectives by topic,\u201d and see where it takes your conversation.\nUltimately, AI\u2019s greatest impact will not be how it helps us do more of the same faster\u2014but how it helps us work in new, different ways that make the most of our human intelligence and help us think more deeply.\nOf course, as chief scientist here at Microsoft, my prediction that AI will start asking us questions isn\u2019t something I plan to just passively observe. I get to help make it come true. And we should all be working to make the future with AI one we are excited to be a part of.\nJamie Dimon is right.

Best Buy says that this is its biggest training effort in a decade in both scope and number of employees.\nBest Buy has worked with Microsoft and chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. to build instruction materials and train more than 30,000 employees so far and is still going. The retailer says it has exclusive sales rights to more than 40% of the Copilot+ PC\u2019s models, including the OLED Surface Pro.\nBest Buy gained 0.8% at 8:26 a.m. in premarket trading in New York. Its shares had gained nearly 17% year to date through Monday\u2019s close.\nGeek Squad tech support agents will be doing Copilot+ demonstrations in hundreds of stores and answering questions from shoppers. The retailer will also offer AI computers from brands such as Dell Technologies Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.\n\u201cEspecially because AI is such a buzzword and can be misunderstood so easily, we\u2019ve been very thoughtful about the material and how we are putting it together,\u201d said Luke Motschenbacher, president of retail at Best Buy.\nAI PCs contain neural processing units, a kind of chip that is meant to speed up artificial intelligence work like running a chatbot. The first wave of AI PCs will contain chips made by Qualcomm, a maker of smartphone components that\u2019s been trying to grab a foothold in laptops for years.\nBest Buy\u2019s training for Copilot+ PCs has been more extensive than for other types of new products, since AI is a new technology. These Microsoft computers come with features like summarization that encapsulate pages of documents and a paint function that can turn a text into an image. And employees have been coached on AI-specific concepts like TOPS, or trillions of operations per second, that measure AI performance.\nThe major AI training push comes at a crucial moment. Best Buy, which operates about 1,100 stores, is looking to reverse 10 straight quarters of declining same-store sales. Industry analysts expect that new AI products will be a big driver of growth, along with newer categories like e-bikes.\nAfter the introduction of Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speakers with the intelligent personal assistant Alexa debuted in late 2014, Best Buy began to see an increase in requests for help in setting up the new technology. In 2016, it expanded its in-home service staff to aid customers with everything from sound bars to smart shades. By the end of 2017, Best Buy was reporting that same-store sales had increased the most since 2003.\nBest Buy\u2019s business boomed again during the pandemic when people rushed to upgrade electronics and home appliances, though sales have fallen off since then. Consumers have largely remained on the sidelines for bigger purchases due to inflation and high interest rates.\nCompany executives have said they expect the consumer-electronics industry to return to growth. Laptop sales turned slightly positive during the fourth quarter, they have said, and computing products are expected to grow for the full year due to new wave of products and the need to replace or upgrade older ones.\n(Updates with premarket share move in the fourth paragraph.

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other tech stocks.\nOn December 1, 2023, Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he explained that tech stocks are expected to outperform non-tech stocks in 2024. Over the past 10 years, tech earnings have compounded at almost 16% and non-tech earnings have compounded at 6%. 2023 was a rebound year for the tech industry after a downturn in 2022 due to rising interest rates. Big Tech companies and their operational efficiencies have poised them for strong growth. While inflation and interest rates will determine what goes down, companies that have invested in augmented intelligence will experience secular growth. Gerstner thinks that the spread between 16% and 6% will be a recurring trend in 2024.\nOn June 11, Brad Gerstner made another appearance on CNBC and\u00a0addressed the speculation surrounding the software industry. Gerstner suggested that despite headwinds, the software industry is still valuable as companies and startups are still making deals. Gerstner believes there are three main reasons for the downward trajectory of the software industry. He thinks that CEOs and CTOs are cautious when it comes to making investments in software. Executives want a clearer picture of the AI boom before making risky investments. Moreover, interest rates are higher than expectations, due to delayed rate cuts and compressing multiples. Lastly, general uncertainty about the future has been detrimental to the growth of the software industry. Gerstner pointed out that since the software industry is trading at 20% below its ten-year average, this may be the best time to allocate stakes in software companies. You can also take a look at the best Robinhood stocks under $20.\nGerstner thinks data and databases are extremely vital to AI applications. He thinks that companies using data to power AI are far ahead of companies simply automating services. Big Tech companies have data at the forefront of all their artificial intelligence applications. You can also read our piece on the stocks hedge funds are crazy about right now.\nBrad Gerstner is bullish on tech, and particularly software and AI. In Q1 2024, he initiated 6 new positions and also raised his stakes in 2 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.5 billion in 13F securities. With that, let's discuss his top tech stock picks.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital's Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we\u2019ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 28.\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nAltimeter Capital's Stake Value: $694,133,306\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 293\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is among Brad Gerstner's top 5 stock picks. The stock accounts for nearly 11% of Altimeter Capital's 13F portfolio. The company's overall growth in the quarter was driven by the demand for Microsoft Cloud, which logged $35 billion in revenue, up by 23% year-over-year. Microsoft Azure remained a top pick among customers. Over 65% of the Fortune 500 companies and more than 30,000 organizations use Azure OpenAI Service and more than 30,000 organizations use Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for their organization's needs. The number of organizations using Copilot grew by 175% quarter-over-quarter.\nMicrosoft introduced Phi-3 in April, the company's family of small language models measuring 3.8 billion parameters, that perform better than large models. It is available in the Microsoft Azure AI Model Catalog and on Hugging Face. Phi-3 models will also be available as an NVIDIA NIM Microservice that is capable of being deployed anywhere. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to launch additional models to the Phi-3 like Phi-3-small, measuring 7 billion parameters, and Phi-3-medium, measuring 14 billion parameters.\nAzure Arc, a hybrid multi-cloud management tool, now has over 33,000 customers, increasing twofold year-over-year. The company saw an 80% increase for its $100 million Azure deals year-over-year. $10 million deals, on the other hand, doubled in the same time frame. Its next-gen analytics platform, Fabric, has over 11,000 paid customers.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2024, 293 hedge funds held stakes in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with total positions amounting to $88.16 billion. Mar Vista Investment Partners is also bullish on the stock because of its strong position in the digital landscape. Here are comments from Mar Vista Investment Partners\u2019 Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 5th on our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Brad Gerstner. You can visit 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner to see the other tech stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Four years and three CEOs after Slack first lashed out at Microsoft over its generous Teams and Office package, the company\u2019s newest boss is cheering what could be a multibillion-dollar judgment against its rival.\nSpeaking to Fortune, Slack CEO Denise Dresser welcomed the EU\u2019s latest intensification in its war with big tech after the bloc leveled competition charges that appeared to be hurting Slack.\nThe EU raised antitrust concerns with Microsoft on Tuesday for bundling its Teams and Office packages, which competitors including Slack argue give it an illegal advantage. The EU said Microsoft\u2019s actions were \u201cpossibly abusive.\u201d\n\u201cPreserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president in charge of competition policy at the EU.\nSlack, owned by Salesforce since 2021, first brought its complaint against Microsoft in 2020. But swirling momentum against the biggest names in tech means these complaints are now materializing into action.\n\u201cWe are encouraged by their statement of objection and certainly are supportive of anything that encourages free and fare competition in the marketplace,\u201d Dresser told Fortune.\nIn April, Microsoft said it would stop bundling Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, after scrapping it in the EU last year.\nMicrosoft could be fined up to 10% of its annual revenue, equivalent to $21 billion, if found guilty.\nIn a later statement to Fortune, Salesforce\u2019s president and chief legal officer Sabastian Niles said: \u201cThe Statement of Objections issued today by the European Commission is a win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft\u2019s practices with Teams have harmed competition.\n\u201cWe appreciate the Commission\u2019s thorough investigation of Slack's complaint and urge the Commission to move towards a swift, binding, and effective remedy that restores free and fair choice and promotes competition, interoperability, and innovation in the digital ecosystem.\u201d\nA representative for Microsoft told Fortune: \"Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2019s remaining concerns.\"\nFor Dresser, the news that the EU appears likely to take action against Microsoft will be a further boost as she steadies the Slack ship after a series of high-profile departures.\nDresser became the workplace messaging group\u2019s third CEO within 10 months last year after Lidiane Jones\u2019s surprise exit to the dating app Bumble.\nThe company is plotting its big AI play, pointing out that Slack AI already saves users 97 minutes per week.\nThe EU is strengthening its rhetoric and actions against big tech\u2019s stranglehold on European industry.\nThe bloc fined Apple \u20ac1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) earlier this year over allegations it shut out music streaming competitors, most notably Spotify, which brought the complaint.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Let\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s only one thing most of the tech world is interested in today: Apple\u2019s most important Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in years, at which it will reveal its possibly make-or-break AI strategy. But Tim Cook\u2019s crucial keynote is taking place as this newsletter comes out, and we already gave you some previews a couple days ago, so right now let\u2019s talk about gaming.\nIt\u2019s increasingly looking like Microsoft will reveal a proper Xbox handheld. Yesterday, after the annual Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer made an appearance at IGN Live, and one of the things he was asked about was the possibility of making a version of the legendary console that users can carry around with them.\nNow, Spencer has previously declared his enthusiasm for the concept of handhelds, but this time he wouldn\u2019t even let his interviewer finish the question. \u201cWe should have a handheld!\u201d he exclaimed. Spencer wouldn\u2019t go so far as to confirm it was coming, but he did say \u201cthe future for us in hardware is pretty awesome\u201d and professed excitement about the work his team was doing on \u201cdifferent form factors.\u201d\nSpencer also said he finds the ability to play games locally \u201cvery important\u201d in a handheld, which should make sense to anyone who ever finds themselves out of range of an internet connection. That would be a major distinction between the hypothetical Xbox handheld and Sony\u2019s PlayStation Portal, which came out late last year and which only streams games from the PlayStation 5 via the cloud. \u201cI like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck,\u201d Spencer said, referring to handhelds that take the on-device gaming approach.\nIt should also be noted that Sony is rumored to be working on a new PlayStation handheld that also runs games locally\u2014a successor to the classic PlayStation Portable or PSP, which ran games off a little optical disc called the Universal Media Disc, and was available between 2004 and 2014. But again, that\u2019s just a rumor, and even the Xbox handheld remains in the realm of the theoretical for now.\nAs for stuff that\u2019s actually been announced, Microsoft used its showcase yesterday to reveal new, disc-free versions of its Xbox Series X and S consoles, which it hopes will catch on with buyers when available for the upcoming holiday season 2024 (and no, I also can\u2019t believe I\u2019m already writing that phrase). Sony is widely expected to release a PlayStation 5 Pro around the same time; both companies will be hoping these launches pull them out of an industry-wide sales slump for consoles and games alike.\nSo there you go\u2014non-Apple news is still happening!

        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nTAIPEI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Taiwanese chip design giant MediaTek is developing an Arm-based personal computer chip that will run Microsoft's Windows operating system, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nLast month, Microsoft unveiled a new generation of laptops that feature chips designed with Arm Holdings tech, which provide enough horsepower to run the artificial intelligence applications that executives said were the future of consumer computing. The MediaTek chip is geared toward this effort.\nThe software company's plans take aim at Apple which has released its own Arm-based chips for Mac computers for roughly four years. And Microsoft's decision to optimize Windows for Arm could threaten Intel's longstanding dominance in the PC market.\nMediaTek and Microsoft declined to comment.\nMediaTek's Taiwan-listed shares closed up 2.4% on Wednesday, outperforming the broader index's 1.2% gain.\nThe MediaTek PC chip is set to launch late next year after Qualcomm's exclusive deal to supply chips for laptops expires, two of the people said. The chip is based on Arm's ready-made designs, which can significantly speed development because less design work is needed using ready-made, tested chip components.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Microsoft has approved MediaTek's PC chip for the Copilot+ Windows program.\nExecutives at Arm have said one of its customers used the ready-made components to build a chip in roughly nine months for a design that is already complete, which MediaTek's is not. For experienced chip design businesses, advanced chips typically take considerably more than a year to construct and test, depending on the complexity.\nIn 2016, Microsoft tapped Qualcomm to spearhead moving the Windows operating system to Arm's underlying processor architecture, which has long powered smartphones and their small batteries. Microsoft granted Qualcomm an exclusivity arrangement to develop Arm-based Windows-compatible chips until 2024, Reuters reported last year.\nBecause the Qualcomm exclusivity arrangement with Microsoft is expiring, other designers have opted to build chips to help power Microsoft's latest push to use Arm designs. For decades, Windows machines have relied on chip architecture made by Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\nNvidia and AMD are working on Arm designs for Windows machines, Reuters reported last year. The Nvidia effort for its PC chip involves help from MediaTek, according to a person familiar with the matter. The MediaTek effort for a PC chip is separate from its collaboration with Nvidia, two of the people said.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- The US is opening antitrust investigations into two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp., over their dominance of the rapidly emerging field of artificial intelligence, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHunter Biden Convicted of Gun Charges by Jury in Delaware\nApple Hits Record After Introducing \u2018AI for the Rest of Us\u2019\nMusk to Ban Apple Devices If OpenAI Is Integrated Into OS\nFed\u2019s Higher-for-Longer Stance Hits Firms That Expected Rate Cut\nStocks Rise as Solid Treasury Sale Spurs CPI Bets: Markets Wrap\nMicrosoft has poured more than $13 billion into its partnership with OpenAI, tapping the startup\u2019s generative-AI technology for the Bing search service, Edge internet browser and Windows. Nvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker, has acknowledged allocating its chips to customers it deems most likely to use them quickly, prompting concerns that it has too much power over the market for cutting-edge AI semiconductors.\nThe country\u2019s two antitrust agencies also agreed to divide responsibility over AI. The Federal Trade Commission will handle the inquiry into Microsoft\u2019s ties with OpenAI, while the Justice Department will probe Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI chips, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing inter-agency negotiations. The DOJ will retain oversight of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, the people said.\nThe agencies reached the deal in the last few days after more than six months of negotiations, the people said. The agreement gives each agency authority to open an antitrust probe into the conduct of the respective companies and their recent deals.\nThe FTC has also opened a probe into whether Microsoft failed to properly notify the antitrust agencies about its deal with Inflection AI, according to the people. In March, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hired much of Inflection\u2019s staff. The agency can levy fines if it determines Microsoft violated the law about reporting transactions.\nA Microsoft spokeswoman said the company has not been contacted by the FTC regarding OpenAI.\n\u201cOur agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe take our legal obligations to report transactions seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations.\u201d\nThe DOJ, FTC, OpenAI, Google and Nvidia all declined to comment. The New York Times reported the FTC-DOJ agreement earlier.\nThe Justice Department and FTC jointly enforce US antitrust laws and work together to coordinate which agency will investigate mergers and anticompetitive conduct through a process internally known as clearance. High-profile matters, such as those involving Google, have previously caused bitter clearance disputes between the agencies.\nThe deal was negotiated directly between Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter and FTC Chair Lina Khan, the people said. The two met in person this week on the sidelines of a conference in Washington.\nThe Justice Department had initially proposed splitting up the cases by company, according to the people, taking for itself all antitrust issues related to Microsoft and giving the FTC anything related to Nvidia, the people said. The FTC has previous history with Nvidia, having overseen recent mergers and suing to stop the company from buying Arm Ltd. in December 2021. Nvidia then walked away from that deal.\nThe DOJ\u2019s proposal tracks with past practice. With the exception of Microsoft\u2019s recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Justice has overseen the company since 1993 and has deep familiarity with the search and browser markets owing to its recent cases against Google.\nThe FTC disagreed with that division of authority, arguing that it has the more relevant experience to take on Microsoft and that its consumer protection mandate means it\u2019s in a better position to challenge potentially problematic conduct by AI startups.\nThe commission has been in the beginning stages of a probe into the cloud computing market, seeking public comments last year. As part of that inquiry, online rivals and others complained about both Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, the No. 1 and No. 2 cloud companies respectively, which control more than 55% of the market.\nThe agency also sought information from OpenAI last year as part of a probe into whether the company engaged in unfair or deceptive practices that caused \u201creputational harm\u201d to consumers.\nIn January, the FTC opened an inquiry into Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI investment as well as deals by Google and Amazon to invest in rival AI-startup Anthropic. The five-member agency didn\u2019t inform the Justice Department before announcing that study, according to the people, which heightened tensions between the two agencies.\nLast week, the Justice Department held a public workshop on competition in AI at Stanford University, featuring dozens of companies across the industry. While Nvidia was rarely mentioned by name, companies have said the scarcity of high-powered chips needed to train AI foundation models was significantly impacting the industry.\nNvidia\u2019s leaders have openly acknowledged they allocate the supply of chips and other products to customers. They decide who gets what on the basis of whether or not the would-be recipient is able to immediately put those products to work in a data center that\u2019s ready to go. This is a mechanism to ensure that data center operators don\u2019t hoard chips, Nvidia has said.\nThe chip industry has long endured periods when there isn\u2019t enough supply to meet demand, only to ramp up production and wind up with more chips than buyers. Recently Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk said he\u2019d diverted some of the Nvidia chips he\u2019d ordered from Tesla to other companies he controls because the electric carmaker doesn\u2019t have the space to immediately put them to work.\nOverall Nvidia has said that it\u2019s struggled to get enough supply from its manufacturing partners to meet the rapid surge in demand that it\u2019s received. While that supply is improving, it\u2019s likely to continue to fall short.\nThe European Union also looked at Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI but ultimately decided against a formal probe. The UK\u2019s competition watchdog has also said it would examine the partnership but separately decided last month that a Microsoft deal with French AI company Mistral AI doesn\u2019t qualify for an investigation.\n--With assistance from Jackie Davalos and Davey Alba.\n(Updates with additional details beginning in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks\nFood Companies Hope You Won\u2019t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers\nChina\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\nTesla Shareholders Face the $56 Billion Question\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

He returned to Microsoft in 2019 as Xbox's chief marketing officer.\nEarlier this month, Microsoft held its annual Xbox Games Showcase, where it unveiled new all-digital consoles and trailers for games including the new \"Call of Duty\" title as it looks to spark consumer enthusiasm amid broader spending weakness in the industry.\nWest's departure comes amid a broader restructuring in Xbox's marketing department, where a central gaming marketing team will be formed and a number of other marketing teams will be moved around.\n\"Going forward, the Gaming Leadership Team and I have decided to place marketing closer to the businesses they support,\" Spencer said in the memo.\nMicrosoft also shut down multiple gaming studios in May, including Arkane Austin and consolidated teams, in a cost cutting move.\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n"

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent stock split lowered the price of each individual share after the high-flying stock reached beyond $1,000 and ever since that split a little more than a week ago, the shares have advanced about 12%. This momentum has helped the chip designer reach an enormous milestone. Nvidia just passed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company with a market value topping $3.33 trillion as of market close on Tuesday -- that's compared to the rival software giant's $3.31 trillion market capitalization.\nThere's been a good reason for Nvidia's standout performance in recent times: its dominance in the billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The company holds an 80% share\u00a0and this has helped earnings -- and clearly share price -- to soar. After the enormous gain, and as Nvidia steps ahead of Microsoft, the question now is: Is it too late to invest in this AI chip giant? Let's find out.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) once were best known for powering video games and this helped Nvidia remain financially successful over time. But the AI boom marked a turning point for the company as potential customers realized how particularly well-suited Nvidia's GPUs were to crucial AI tasks. This is thanks to the GPU's ability to process many jobs simultaneously, making this chip ideal for things like the training and inferencing of AI models.\nBut Nvidia hasn't stopped with the GPU and instead created a broad range of products and services -- such as enterprise software -- to support AI customers along the development path. And this has resulted in triple-digit increases in revenue and profit in recent quarters. For example, in the past quarter, Nvidia's revenue reached a new record high of $26 billion -- and revenue linked to AI customers made up a whopping 86% percent of that.\nAs mentioned above, all of this boosted the stock price and prompted Nvidia to announce a 10-for-1 stock split. The goal? To bring the stock to a level that would make it easier for employees and investors to access it. From the announcement in late May to the actual operation earlier this month, Nvidia shares climbed nearly 30%, and they've continued to add to gains.\nNow, let's return to our question. Since Nvidia has climbed to a value above technology powerhouse Microsoft's, is it too late to get in on the stock? A look at valuation shows us that Nvidia is considerably more expensive than it was only a month ago. Today, the stock trades for more than 51x forward earnings estimates compared with about 30 in May.\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nSo does this mean you should hold off on buying this skyrocketing stock? Not necessarily. Yes, Nvidia is more expensive than it was a few weeks ago, but the stock is worth the premium for two reasons: its current leadership in the high-growth AI chip market, and most importantly, the steps it's taking to remain in that position.\nNvidia has committed to updating its GPUs annually, recently saying that after the launch of its new Blackwell architecture and chip later this year, \"other Blackwells\" will follow. This means that even if rivals release new chips, Nvidia, already in the lead, should remain ahead in terms of product performance.\nOn top of this, it's important to remember two other things. First, Nvidia already has secured its reputation as an expert in the AI chip market, and demand for its products and services is surpassing supply -- so it's already in a position of strength. And the innovation I just mentioned could keep this going. Second, the AI growth story is in its early days, with today's $200 billion AI market expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. As a result, Nvidia's AI growth may have a lot farther to go.\nAll of this means that today, even with Nvidia soaring past Microsoft, the investment opportunity is far from over -- and Nvidia still is a top stock to buy and hold for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

With roughly 800,000 shares, CEO Satya Nadella is one of the company's biggest shareholders. His stake is worth a cool $339 million.\nBut there may be another person who owns more Microsoft stock than Nadella. In fact, there may be two larger shareholders.\nAccording to Microsoft's latest proxy filing with the SEC, there's only one company insider besides Nadella that owns more than 500,000 shares. That's Brad Smith, the company's vice chair and president. According to Microsoft, Smith \"leads a team of roughly 2,000 business, legal and corporate affairs professionals located in 54 countries and operating in more than 120 nations.\" His total ownership equates to 554,587 shares worth roughly $235 million.\nOnly one other person comes even close to Smith's ownership level, and that's CFO Amy Hood. She owns a total of 484,692 shares when including deferred compensation.\nThere is a twist to this story, however. The SEC only requires company insiders and those that own more than 5% of a company's stock to disclose their stakes publicly. Therefore, there's a chance that the largest owners of Microsoft stock today include former CEO Steve Ballmer. As of his last disclosure, Ballmer owned a massive stake of 333 million shares. Today, that would be worth around $140 billion, though it is impossible to know how many shares he still has. That's because he is no longer required to disclose his stake publicly.\nWhat about Bill Gates? He left the company in early 2021. As with Ballmer, he also owns less than 5% of the company's shares, so it's unclear exactly what his remaining stake is. But as of his last disclosure in 2021, Gates owned roughly 103 million shares, which today would be worth around $42 billion. The rest of his holdings were donated to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which still retains a stake of around 36 million shares.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The European Union is escalating its scrutiny of the artificial intelligence industry, including taking a fresh look into Microsoft's multibillion-dollar partnership with OpenAI, a top EU official said Friday.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, started reviewing the deal last year to see whether it broke EU merger rules but dropped it after concluding Microsoft hadn't gained control of OpenAI, Margrethe Vestager, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for competition policy, said in a speech.\n\u201cMicrosoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI over the years,\u201d she said \u201cBut we have to make sure that partnerships like this do not become a disguise for one partner getting a controlling influence over the other.\u201d\nShe signalled that the commission would take another tack to examine the deal, and the industry more broadly. It's using the bloc's antitrust rules, which target abusive behavior by companies that have a dominant market position.\nThe commission sent information requests in March to big AI players including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and TikTok, reviewed those replies and is \u201cnow sending a follow-up request for information on the agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI,\u201d Vestager said.\nThe EU wants \u201cto understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competitors,\u201d she said.\nA Microsoft spokesman said, \u201cWe appreciate the European Commission\u2019s thorough review and its conclusion that Microsoft\u2019s investment and partnership with OpenAI does not give Microsoft control over the company. We stand ready to respond to any additional questions the European Commission may have.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the Commission\u2019s goal of keeping the AI industry competitive and innovative, and look forward to continuing our constructive dialogue,\u201d an OpenAI said in a statement, adding that the company welcomes the conclusions of the investigation.\nThe stepped-up scrutiny highlights how European Union regulators have been pacesetters for the global push to rein in big tech companies, including the major AI players. The EU's led the field with its AI Act, which is set to take effect soon and is the world\u2019s first comprehensive set of regulations for AI.\nVestager said the bloc was also concerned about consumer choices for foundation models, which is the technology that underpins generative AI systems like chatbots.\nShe said EU regulators have sent information requests \u201cto better understand the effects of Google\u2019s arrangement with Samsung\" to pre-install Gemini Nano on some devices from the South Korean tech company. Gemini Nano is the smallest version of Google's Gemini AI foundation model.\n\"And we have a number of other preliminary antitrust investigations ongoing into various practices in AI-related markets,\" she added.\nThe commission is also examining so-called \u201cacqui-hires,\u201d where a company buys another one mainly for its talent, such as Microsoft's hiring of Inflection AI's founder Mustafa Suleyman, and other top staff.\n\u201cWe will make sure these practices don\u2019t slip through our merger control rules if they basically lead to a concentration,\u201d she said.\n"

        "Text": "By Noel Randewich and Ankika Biswas\n(Reuters) - Nvidia became the world's most valuable company on Tuesday, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft as its high-end processors play a central role in a scramble to dominate artificial intelligence technology.\nShares of the chipmaker climbed 3.5% to $135.58, lifting its market capitalization to $3.335 trillion, just days after overtaking iPhone maker Apple to become the second most valuable company.\nMicrosoft's stock market value was $3.317 trillion as its shares dipped 0.45%.\nApple's stock slipped over 1%, leaving its value at $3.286 trillion.\nNvidia's stunning surge in market value over the past year has become emblematic of a Wall Street frenzy driven by optimism about emerging AI technology.\nWhile Nvidia's rally has lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs, some investors worry that unbridled optimism about AI could evaporate if signs emerge of a slowdown in spending on the technology.\n\"It's Nvidia's market; we're all just trading in it,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers.\nNvidia has also become by far the most traded company on Wall Street, with daily turnover recently averaging $50 billion, compared to around $10 billion each for Apple, Microsoft and Tesla, according to LSEG data. The chipmaker now accounts for about 16% of all trading in S&P 500 companies.\nNvidia's stock has nearly tripled so far this year, compared with a rise of about 19% in Microsoft shares, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors outpacing supply.\nTech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet are competing to build out their AI computing capabilities and add the technology to their products and services.\nAn insatiable appetite for Nvidia's AI processors, viewed as far superior to competitors' offerings, has left them in tight supply, and many investors view Nvidia as the greatest winner to date from surging AI development.\n\"Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly, but a small misstep is likely to cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful,\" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York.\nTuesday's gain lifted Nvidia's stock to a record high and added over $110 billion to its market capitalization, equivalent to the entire value of Lockheed Martin .\nThe company's market value expanded from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just nine months in February, while taking just over three months to hit $3 trillion in June.\nSince its blowout forecast about a year ago, the company has consistently breezed past Wall Street's lofty expectations for revenue and profit, with demand for its graphics processors far outstripping supply as companies rush to embed AI applications.\nNvidia executives said in May that demand for its Blackwell AI chips could exceed supply \"well into next year.\"\nSharp increases in analysts' expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have outpaced its stellar stock gains, resulting in a fall in the stock's earnings valuation.\nNvidia recently traded at 44 times expected earnings, down from over 84 about a year ago, LSEG data showed.\nIncreasing the appeal for its highly valued stock among individual investors, Nvidia last week split its stock 10-for-one.\n(Reporting by Shristi Achar, Medha Singh and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru, and by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Suzanne McGee and Stephen Culp in New York; Editing by Anil D'Silva, Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

That would value the company at nearly $5 trillion.\nDaniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said: \u201cWe believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\u201d\nHe added that Nvidia\u2019s chips should be seen as \u201cthe new gold or oil\u201d as companies adopt AI.\nNvidia, Microsoft and Apple have been vying for the title of world\u2019s most valuable company for weeks. Last Wednesday,\nApple briefly overtook Microsoft to claim the title after unveiling updates to its iPhone software that will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI).\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has been propelled higher after investing in ChatGPI-maker OpenAI and incorporating AI features into Windows.\nNvidia executives have cashed in on the company\u2019s huge stock rally. Bloomberg reported that they have sold about 770,000 shares this year totalling more than $700m.

        "Author": "  Orianna Rosa Royle ",
        "Text": "Since joining Microsoft in 1992, Satya Nadella has not only impressed those he\u2019s worked for, landing him promotion after promotion until he took the helm 10 years ago\u2014he\u2019s also attracted the admiration of his peers while doing it.\nNow, his fellow CEOs look up to him more than any other Fortune 500 boss, including Doug McMillon of Walmart, which topped the 70th edition of the recently released Fortune 500 list.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why.\nMicrosoft has featured every year on the Fortune 500 since the list was broadened in 1995\u2014and that's no easy feat.\nMany other legacy businesses on the list have dwindled in relevance and watched their position slowly slide down the rankings.\nMicrosft has experienced the opposite, however: The tech giant has steadily climbed the rankings, from 34th place to 13th, since Nadella started steering its ship.\nDespite continuous disruption in the tech industry, Microsoft\u2019s market cap has ballooned from well under $400 billion when Steve Ballmer stepped down, to over $3.16 trillion today. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s revenue has nearly tripled in the past 10 years.\nWhy? Because Nadella knows that businesses that don\u2019t adapt die.\nInstead of resting on its laurels, Nadella has pushed Microsoft to innovate: Bold acquisitions, including LinkedIn and GitHub, paid off, as did its shift into the cloud. Now, Microsoft is futureproofing by investing big in AI.\nAs the CEO told Fortune in our latest cover story: \u201cWhen the paradigm shifts, do you have something to contribute? Because there is no God-given right to exist if you don\u2019t have anything relevant.\u201d\nWhen Nadella took Microsoft\u2019s reigns, his first order of business was changing (or rather, calming) the company culture.\nIt's a far cry from Silicon Valley's unofficial motto of \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d, but encouraging employees to take a breather (even if just mentally) has clearly had a positive impact on Microsoft.\nThe exec was born in India to a Sanskrit scholar mother, who taught him how to be mindful. Every morning, he reminds himself what he\u2019s thankful for and credits that with helping him stay at his a-game.\nFollowing this mindset, the cool, calm, and collected CEO got his senior leadership team on the zen bandwagon by asking them to read Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg, a book about leading using compassion and understanding rather than competition and judgment.\nAccording to an account from the book From Incremental to Exponential, Nadella made it clear that outdated and aggressive top-down behaviors were no longer welcome.\nInstead, he strove to create a comfortable environment where even the lowest-ranked employee felt safe to share their concerns or ideas. At the same time, employees who previously operated with a \u201cknow-it-all\u201d worldview, were told to become \u201clearn it-alls.\u201d\n\u201cIf you take two kids at school, one of them has more innate capability but is a know-it-all. The other person has less innate capability but is a learn-it-all. The learn-it-all does better than the know-it-all,\u201d Nadella said back in 2019 on the podcast Hello Monday as he explained his \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d philosophy. \u201cIt\u2019s about each of us confronting our fixed mindset.\u201d\nBecause of that culture switch, change can be seen in the products themselves.\nNow that developers are asked for feedback on what they\u2019d like to see from the company, Microsoft\u2019s cloud is growing at significant pace. Analysts estimate Azure, which was about half as big as Amazon Web Services five years ago, is now three-quarters its size.\n\u201cAzure is beholden to [developers]; they are the customer, and they will keep using it if they find it helpful and delightful,\u201d Nadella told Fortune.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Watch These Key Stock Price Levels in Each Tech Behemoth\nMarlena Sloss / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAs Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple jostle for the mantle of the world\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalization, watch out for these key chart levels.\nMonitor if buyers can defend an uptrend line in Nvidia shares around $87 during periods of profit taking.\nA breakdown below a key uptrend line in Microsoft shares could act as a catalyst for a decline to two prior record highs around $350.\nThe measuring principle projects a price target in Apple shares of $228 following the stock's breakout from a channel pattern.\n\nAs Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) continue to jostle for the mantle of the world\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalization, we take a look at the weekly chart of each tech behemoth and use technical analysis to identify important chart levels to watch out for.\nSince bottoming out just below the 200-day moving average (MA) in October last year, Nvidia shares have continued to trend sharply higher, with investors promptly buying any minor dips. In saying that, the stock appears stretched to the upside, given it trades around 56% above a multi-month uptrend line and the relative strength index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions with a reading over the 70 threshold.\nDuring periods of profit-taking, monitor if buyers can defend the uptrend line, currently sitting at around $87. A breakdown below this level could see the shares test the top of a prior consolidation area near $50.\nSimilar to Nvidia, Microsoft shares have continued to trend strongly upwards since finding support around the 200-day MA in October last year. However, a key difference is that the Microsoft chart indicate less overbought conditions. The price trades within close proximity to an uptrend line extending back to the October low, with the RSI indicator giving a reading below 70. Although the lower RSI suggests the shares have room to move higher it also indicates the stock has less momentum than Nvidia.\nLooking ahead, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on how price responds to the uptrend line. A failure to hold this key technical indicator could act as a catalyst for a decline to two prior record highs in the stock around $350.\nApple shares traded within a narrow 12-month channel before staging a volume-backed breakout earlier this month after unveiling Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker\u2019s personalized artificial intelligence (AI) to be installed on its devices. Although, the RSI indicator has recently moved into overbought territory, the stock has ample room to continue moving higher given its extended consolidation before the breakout.\nInvestors can project a potential price target using the measuring principle. To do this, calculate the distance between the channel\u2019s lower and upper trendlines and add that amount to the breakout point. For example, adding $31 to the $197 breakout point forecasts a price target of $228.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Nvidia and Microsoft Will Make Up Over 40% of This Popular ETF. Here's Why This Alternative ETF Could Be a Better Option.",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The three largest tech companies right now (as measured by market cap) are 1. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), 2. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and 3. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), with each valued relatively close to the other, and all three valued over $3.25 trillion. Not surprisingly, these stocks are the top three holdings of the popular State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK), which tracks the S&P Technology Select Sector index.\nThe holdings in the fund are rebalanced quarterly to account for changing valuations, and that has created a situation. In an unusual quirk, the top two holdings in this exchange-traded fund (ETF) (Microsoft and Apple) now account for the bulk of its portfolio, far outstripping its third-largest holding (Nvidia). The reason why is that the index has a rule that caps holdings with over 5% allocations so that the top two cannot exceed 50% of the index's combined portfolio. There is another rule in effect saying that once the 50% allocation is breached, no other stock in the portfolio (including No. 3) can exceed 4.5% of the index. It sounds complicated because these investing rules often are. Suffice it to say the rules exist for some useful reason, but they are creating an unforeseen situation because of some unusually strong stock performance by these three stocks.\nThese rules have resulted in Microsoft and Apple each representing over 20% of the index at the moment, while the No. 3 holding (Nvidia) represents less than 6%. However, Nvidia's market cap exceeded Apple's on the day chosen to determine the index's next quarterly rebalancing, So the chipmaker will jump up to represent over 20% of the index when the rebalancing happens while Apple's weighting is expected to drop to around 4.5%.\nThis will cause the $71 billion ETF to buy a lot of Nvidia shares (at elevated prices) while subsequently dumping a bunch of Apple shares (also at elevated prices). That's not necessarily a smart investing move to make right now, but rules are rules.\nAn ETF dominated by Microsoft and Nvidia, two of the companies most benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI), doesn't seem like a bad idea on the surface.\nNvidia has been the biggest AI winner thus far with its graphic processing units (GPUs) being the choice for the infrastructure needed for AI model training and inference. The company isn't the only producer of GPUs, but programmers have long been trained on Nvidia's Cuda software platform, which has led it to become the de facto GPU leader in the space, with a wide moat. As a result, its first-quarter revenue surged 262% to $26 billion.\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has been an early adopter of AI through its large investment and partnership with OpenAI. The company's Azure cloud computing business has been the biggest beneficiary so far, as customers build their own AI solutions using its Azure platform. Microsoft has also benefited from AI in other areas, including the adoption of its AI assistant Copilot. Its developer platform GitHub grew revenue by 45% year over year last quarter with more companies embracing its GitHub Copilot. And Microsoft 365 saw revenue jump 14% helped by the early success of Copilot in that platform.\nAs Nvidia and Microsoft stocks perform, so will the ETF given the large weighting in these names.\nHowever, the dramatic weighting shift between Nvidia and Apple shows the risk associated with the ETF. It also missed out on some of Nvidia's earlier gains because of its allocation rules. Meanwhile, one poor quarterly showing from Nvidia could dramatically knock down its weighting. It seems these rules intended to benefit shareholders might actually be hurting them.\nGiven these issues, I think there is a better alternative for investors who like the idea of an ETF with very large positions in Nvidia and Microsoft. It could be a better choice in the long run than the State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF.\nOne great option for investors is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT). Like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF, it has large positions in Nvidia and Microsoft. But its top three positions are more balanced.\nAt the end of May, Microsoft was its largest position at 16.7%, followed by Apple at 15.9%, and Nvidia at 14%. Given Nvidia's strong June performance so far, it could very well be its top position currently.\nOther holdings have much smaller weightings, including Broadcom at 4.2%, Advanced Micro Devices at 1.9%, and Qualcomm at 1.6%.\nThe Vanguard ETF has been a strong performer, averaging a 20.3% annual return over the past decade. It has a comparable average return to the State Street fund. And because the Vanguard ETF does not have the same rebalancing quirk, I think it is the better option for investors looking for some nice tech exposure with heavy weightings toward AI leaders Nvidia and Microsoft without certain buying and selling rules that force some questionable stock transactions.\nBefore you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  SARAH PARVINI and MATT O'BRIEN ",
        "Text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Center for Investigative Reporting said Thursday it has sued ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its closest business partner, Microsoft, marking a new front in the news industry's fight against unauthorized use of its content on artificial intelligence platforms.\nThe nonprofit, which produces Mother Jones and Reveal, said that OpenAI used its content without permission and without offering compensation, violating copyrights on the organization\u2019s journalism. The lawsuit, filed in a New York federal court, describes OpenAI's business as \u201cbuilt on the exploitation of copyrighted works\u201d and focuses on how AI-generated summaries of articles threaten publishers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s immensely dangerous,\u201d Monika Bauerlein, the nonprofit's CEO, told The Associated Press. \u201cOur existence relies on users finding our work valuable and deciding to support it.\"\nBauerlein said that \u201cwhen people can no longer develop that relationship with our work, when they no longer encounter Mother Jones or Reveal, then their relationship is with the AI tool.\u201d\nThat, she said, could \u201ccut the entire foundation of our existence as an independent newsroom out from under us\" while also threatening the future of other news organizations.\nThe lawsuit is the latest against OpenAI and Microsoft to land at Manhattan\u2019s federal court, where the companies are already battling a series of other copyright lawsuits from The New York Times, other media outlets and bestselling authors such as John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and George R.R. Martin. The companies also face a separate case in San Francisco\u2019s federal court brought by authors including comedian Sarah Silverman.\nSome news organizations have chosen to collaborate rather than fight with OpenAI by signing deals to get compensated for sharing news content that can be used to train its AI systems. The latest to do so is Time, which announced Thursday that OpenAI will get access to its \u201cextensive archives from the last 101 years.\u201d\nOpenAI didn\u2019t respond directly to the lawsuit Thursday but said in a statement that it is \u201cworking collaboratively with the news industry and partnering with global news publishers to display their content in our products like ChatGPT, including summaries, quotes, and attribution, to drive traffic back to the original articles.\u201d Microsoft didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nOpenAI and other major AI developers don\u2019t typically disclose their data sources but have argued that taking troves of publicly accessible online text, images and other media to train their AI systems is protected by the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine of American copyright law. CIR's lawsuit says a dataset that OpenAI has acknowledged using to build an earlier version of its chatbot technology contained thousands of links to the website of Mother Jones, a 48-year-old print magazine that's been publishing online since 1993. But the text used for AI training was usually missing information about a story's author, title or copyright notice.\nLast summer, more than 4,000 writers signed a letter to the CEOs of OpenAI and other tech companies accusing them of exploitative practices in building chatbots.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a free resource for these AI companies to ingest and make money on,\u201d Bauerlein said of news media. \u201cThey pay for office space, they pay for electricity, they pay salaries for their workers. Why would the content that they ingest be the only thing that they don\u2019t (pay for)?\u201d\nThe AP is among the news organizations that have made licensing deals over the past year with OpenAI; others include The Wall Street Journal and New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France\u2019s Le Monde newspaper and the London-based Financial Times.\nMother Jones and CIR were both founded in the 1970s and merged earlier this year. Both are based in San Francisco, as is OpenAI.\nThe lawsuit from CIR, also known for its Reveal podcast and radio show, outlines the expense of producing investigative journalism and warns that losing control of copyrighted content will result in less revenue and even fewer reporters to tell important stories in \u201ctoday\u2019s paltry media landscape.\u201d\n\u201cWith fewer investigative news stories told, the cost to democracy will be enormous,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\u2014\u2014\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\u2014\u2014\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.\n"

And that's why you see them surpassing 3 trillion, surpassing Apple for market cap. But I believe Nvidia could be the most valuable company in the world, when we look out over the coming years.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the FTC will look into OpenAI and Microsoft.\nAlthough the chatbot firm is officially a non-profit, it has a for-profit subsidiary that is heavily backed by the Windows maker.\nRegulators have previously expressed a range of concerns around AI, including the advantage that Big Tech has in its access to data used to train software models.\nWatchdogs are also worried about what the technology could do to the market for creative work.\nThe FTC is already looking into claims OpenAI flouted consumer protection laws, and has ordered several Big Tech players to reveal details on their partnerships.\nIt shares responsibility for enforcing competition laws with the DoJ, but the two try to avoid duplicating investigative efforts.\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Institutions' substantial holdings in Microsoft implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership\n Insiders have sold recently \nIf you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 73% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nLast week\u2019s 4.4% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 30%.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Microsoft.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nMicrosoft already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Microsoft, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Microsoft is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Microsoft Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. \nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Microsoft better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Microsoft  you should be aware of.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

        "Title": "How Nvidia Could Help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft Stocks Soar Even More",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's been a great time to own shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). All three stocks delivered strong gains last year and are up by double-digit percentages so far in 2024.\nBut it's been a spectacular time to own shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023 and has vaulted more than 140% higher year to date.\nYou've probably heard the adage that \"success begets success.\" I think we'll see this proved in a convincing manner, with one company's success translating to success for others. Here's how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft stocks soar even more.\nTo understand how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, we first need to know something important about the three companies. Their cloud units are key growth drivers.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue jumped 28.4% year over year. This business generated nearly 20% of the company's total revenue growth despite making up less than 12% of total revenue.\nIt was a similar story for Amazon. Revenue for the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit increased 17% year over year in the first quarter, almost 39% of total revenue growth. AWS was an even bigger driver of Amazon's earnings growth.\nWhat about Microsoft? Its cloud business delivered revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter (which ended March 31) of 23% -- roughly 73% of total revenue growth.\nAnything that drives more customers to the cloud will directly help sales and earnings growth for Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. And over the long term, that should translate to increasing stock prices for each company.\nThis is where Nvidia comes into the picture. Its technology is helping all three giant cloud service providers to attract more customers and more business from existing customers.\nNvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress explained how the company is helping cloud service providers grow in its first-quarter earnings call. She said that organizations that use Nvidia's GPUs are able to train their large language models (LLMs) more quickly and more cost-effectively than with other chips. They can also deploy those models at the lowest cost with Nvidia's GPUs, Kress said.\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft enjoy exceptional returns on investment when they use Nvidia's AI technology. Kress said that cloud providers can earn $5 in hosting revenue with Nvidia's GPUs over four years for every $1 invested in the company's AI infrastructure.\nThese big cloud service providers also have ample motivation to adopt new technology introduced by Nvidia. In his company's first-quarter call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of organizations being able to train AI models quickly.\nFor example, the company's forthcoming Blackwell GPU architecture enables training that is four times faster than with its wildly popular H100 GPUs. The new platform supports 30 times faster AI inference. It's not surprising that Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are among the early buyers of Blackwell -- even before it ships later this year.\nHaven't Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft developed their own AI chips? Could Nvidia's top customers become its rivals over time? Yes and yes.\nHuang was asked about this by an analyst in the first-quarter call. He responded by pointing out how Nvidia's technology differs from the custom chips the big cloud service providers offer. He believes that the scope, versatility, and low total cost of ownership of Nvidia's accelerated computing architecture; its pervasiveness across all types of computers, and the company's AI factories stand out as key competitive advantages.\nFor now, Nvidia and its big cloud customers enjoy a symbiotic relationship. Nvidia's sales grow as it launches new and improved AI technology. Alphabet's, Amazon's, and Microsoft's sales grow as they use Nvidia's latest products to attract customers. It's a win-win proposition for all four companies -- and their investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "On Tuesday, June 18, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) passed Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company for the very first time. As of this writing, Nvidia stock is up more than 200% in the past year and is now worth over $3.3 trillion.\nNow that its stock is the world's most valuable (based on market cap), many investors likely are wondering if they should sell or continue holding. Some who are on the sidelines might even wonder if it's too late to buy. Perhaps history can be a guide to making these decisions.\nWhen it comes to the most valuable stock listed on a U.S. exchange, there have been four other companies that have worn the crown over the last 30 years: General Electric, which is now GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE), Microsoft, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). And investors might be pleasantly surprised by what happened to these stocks after reaching the top.\nOn Sept. 15, 1998, Microsoft passed General Electric to become the most valuable stock for the first time. According to data from the nonprofit American Business History Center, General Electric had been the top company without interruption for several years.\nFor its part, Microsoft sat by itself at the top of the leaderboard for a couple of years. Moreover, the stock more than doubled less than two years after it initially passed General Electric.\nThis is the first lesson from history: Once a company reaches the top, it tends to stay at the top for multiple years. That was the case for General Electric and Microsoft.\nAnd it was also the case for ExxonMobil and Apple. Therefore, if it follows the historical pattern, Nvidia stock will also likely enjoy a prolonged period at the top.\nOnce a company initially becomes the most valuable, history shows the stock price usually hasn't peaked yet. For example, ExxonMobil topped General Electric in February 2005. From there, the oil company's stock would rise another 60% over the next couple of years and 75% over the following decade.\nApple passed ExxonMobil in August 2011. In the five years leading up to taking the top spot, the stock was up around 500%, which is spectacular. Many investors likely thought they had missed the boat. But the stock didn't stop there: It doubled again over the subsequent five years.\nTherefore, if history is any guide, Nvidia stock could enjoy multiple years at the top and continue increasing in value.\nPerhaps the most surprising thing from history is that the previous most valuable stocks outperformed the S&P 500 for the next five years after they reached the top.\nCompany\nFive-Year Performance After Becoming the Most Valuable Stock\nComparable Performance of the S&P 500\nPercentage Points of Alpha\nMicrosoft\n5%\n(2%)\n7\nExxonMobil\n11%\n(8%)\n19\nApple\n102%\n86%\n16\nNvidia\n?\n?\n?\nReturn data according to YCharts. Chart by author. *Alpha refers to a stock's performance relative to a benchmark (in this case, the S&P 500) and is designated in terms of percentage-point difference.\nIt's important to zoom out and consider why this is true. It's because a company doesn't just become the world's most valuable for no reason. Something good must be happening with the business. And whatever trends are in the company's favor tend to last for multiple years, at least.\nFor Microsoft, it rode the PC revolution to take the top spot. ExxonMobil benefited from an extreme and prolonged spike in oil prices. And Apple was at the front of the smartphone trend. These were material drivers of each business that played out over years, not days.\nNvidia is benefiting from the surging adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Even if there's a lot of over-the-top hype with this trend, important things are happening in AI, and many businesses are likely to continue experimenting with the technology's application in the coming years. This means that business could stay good for Nvidia, leading to more market-beating gains.\nAs an investor who places a strong emphasis on value, the valuation of Nvidia stock personally makes me quite nervous. The market cap is over $3 trillion, and it trades at an extreme price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 42. In the history of the stock market, there has never been a company this big that sported a valuation this high. For perspective, Nvidia's valuation is currently triple the valuation of Microsoft in the second-place spot.\nMy discomfort with the valuation aside, I can't deny that history says Nvidia stock hasn't peaked yet. It could stay at the top for multiple years. And it could outperform the S&P 500 from here as the AI trend continues to play out.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jason Collins ",
        "Text": "When it comes to the world's richest people, Microsoft founder Bill Gates is often found near the top of that list, and he achieved that by doing one simple thing: staying frugal. Here's how Gates ensured Microsoft's successful future and his own financial success.\nBill Gates, also known as William Henry Gates III, is a striking example of how frugality can lead to immense wealth. As one of the world's richest individuals and co-founder of the powerhouse software company Microsoft, Gates\u2019 net worth in 2024 is a staggering $128 billion, currently placing him in 7th position on Forbes\u2019 list.\nDon't Miss:\nAre you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average?\nRight from the beginning, when Gates and Paul Allen signed that fateful Altair deal in 1975, Microsoft experienced a successful trajectory that continues to this day. Statista revealed that in the second financial quarter of 2024, the software company brought in over $62 billion in revenue and boasts over 1.2 billion users globally. This success comes with hard work and careful financial management.\nAs a billionaire, Gates endeavors to be as financially conservative as possible and practices frugal living. Gates has adhered to this principle for years, and during an interview back in 1998, Gates said, \"I wanted to have enough money in the bank to pay a year's worth of payroll, even if we didn't get any payments coming in, and I'm true to that almost the whole time.\" Gates has now established an emergency fund for Microsoft to ensure the company's financial stability during challenging times. For example, Gates revealed that one of his significant financial regrets for the company was missing out on competing with Apple after the release of the first iPhone, however, Gates learned from this mistake.\nDuring an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, Gates elaborated on this emergency fund and how he built it. He told the host, \"I always had to be careful that we wouldn't hire too many people,\" and added, \"I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, What if we don't get paid? Will I be able to meet the payroll?\"\nTrending: Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nGates's frugality extends beyond his business practices and into his personal life. One of his habits involves avoiding spending money on expensive clothing and spending money cautiously. According to reports, Gates purchased his Porsche automobile only after he knew Microsoft was successful. For Gates, being frugal doesn't just mean hoarding your money, but using it for the betterment of others, much like Dave Ramsey's philosophy of serving others. His Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has donated billions of dollars, is a testament to this.\nIn addition to being frugal, Gates has other surprisingly simple habits that have helped him build a successful company and gain wealth. One of the habits Gates makes sure he carries out daily is reading. Gates reveals that he is constantly reading and aims to read at least 50 books per year by reading at least one hour per day, often including headlines from The Economist and The Wall Street Journal. According to reports, Gates has a massive library of 2,100 square feet. Another habit that Gate follows is following a routine and avoiding procrastinating.\nGates enjoys schedules and routines so much that his day is organized into five-minute intervals with fixed slots.He does this to avoid getting stuck on a task for too long, to avoid distractions, and to ensure that he does not procrastinate. The final habit that Gates believes in is giving credit where credit is due, and in the world of business, this is a refreshing change.\nRead Next:\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\nHow much money will a $200,000 annuity pay out each month?

        "Title": "Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett\u2019s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 302\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is not only the top hedge fund stock pick but it is also the most valuable technology company in the world. Its key role in the technology industry also enables it to keep a keen eye on new technologies, the latest of which is AI. Under its CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has successfully diversified from personal to enterprise computing and moved forward from a rather disastrous foray into consumer electronics. Enterprise computing also enables it to fully utilize AI through initiatives such as the new CoPilot AI platform, which can be used for a myriad of use cases such as evaluating code. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s role as Windows' developer provides it with a unique opportunity to leverage AI internally as well, and success with AI commercialization by convincing businesses to use the technology will be key factors for its success.\nMar Vista Investment mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2024 investor letter and shared:\nMicrosoft continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure- as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft's solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA\u00a0and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be in a race over the next year to hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion thanks to surging enthusiasm over the capabilities of artificial intelligence, according to analysts at Wedbush.\nAt the end of trading on Friday, software titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s market value had stood at $3.29 trillion. The market cap of iPhone-maker Apple's, meanwhile, has reached $3.26 trillion, just outpacing AI-darling Nvidia's valuation of $3.24 trillion.\nIn a note to clients on Sunday, the Wedbush analysts laid out the case for optimism surrounding each company.\nFor Microsoft, the analysts argued that AI will help the firm monetize its \"massive\" base of installed enterprise users over the coming years. Microsoft, which has previously backed ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has outlined plans to bring AI into a number of fields across the business world with its Copilot offering.\nDespite recently being widely considered to be a laggard in the AI race, Apple unveiled a string of AI-powered enhancements to its products at its annual developers conference last week that the Wedbush analysts said could trigger a \"super cycle\" in iPhone sales.\nFinally, the Wedbush analysts said Nvidia's AI-optimized chips are \"in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector\" as an increasing number of businesses embrace the nascent technology.\nAlthough they flagged that AI could disrupt near-term sales cycles in some tech stocks, the analysts added the \"massive\" expected wave of expenditures will not only fuel a new \"industrial revolution\" in the tech industry but also underpin a broader market rally \"well in 2025.\"\n\"In a nutshell, we believe this tech bull market has legs that will ultimately broaden out to the rest of software, consumer tech, cyber security, semis, and infrastructure over the next 12 to 18 months,\" the Wedbush analysts said.\nRelated Articles\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia in race to hit $4 trillion market cap - Wedbush\nAnalysis-French election worries rekindle market memories of UK budget rout\nStanChart loses bid to cut US sanctions breach claims from UK lawsuit\n"

        "Author": "  Lionel Lim ",
        "Text": "In April, Microsoft announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in G42, the United Arab Emirates' leading AI company, one of many investments in AI startups and companies around the world.\nMicrosoft's U.S. investment followed a November 2023 report from The New York Times on G42's ties to Chinese companies, including the U.S.-sanctioned company Huawei. Weeks later, G42 announced that it was cutting ties with its Chinese suppliers, with CEO Peng Xiao telling the Financial Times that he had to choose between the U.S. and China. \"We cannot work with both sides,\" he told the newspaper at the time.\nIn April, Microsoft said its investment was made after \"close consultation with both the UAE and U.S. governments.\"\nOn Monday, one White House official explained why the U.S. government was interested in the deal.\nAt a Council of Foreign Relations event, White House technology advisor Tarun Chhabra called the Microsoft-G42 tie-up a \"positive development,\" precisely because it pushed out Huawei. Washington wants to see \"trusted digital infrastructure\" in countries that has a strong U.S. military or economic presence, Chhabra said, and so Washington has an interest in encouraging places to stop working with the blacklisted Chinese tech company.\nThe U.S. has for years pushed allies to cut Huawei out of their telecoms networks. U.S. officials allege that Huawei has ties to China's military, and that using Huawei devices leaves customers open to Chinese espionage. (Huawei has long denied these allegations). U.S. allies in Europe and within the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence group have pledged to remove Huawei equipment from their networks.\nWashington's focus is now shifting to the Middle East. The region has a \"very high conviction of the coming capabilities of AI,\" Chhabra said, which means countries want access to advanced technology. That means Washington is paying close attention to how governments and companies in the region will safeguard U.S. technologies, Chhabra explained.\n\"The effort to work with Microsoft as an alternative to Huawei is generally a positive development and one that we want to encourage,\" Chhabra said.\nG42 is an AI-focused holding company founded in 2018. The firm's chairman and controlling shareholder is Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE\u2019s national security adviser.\nThe Emirati firm has business agreements with several top U.S. AI companies, including ChatGPT developer OpenAI.\nG42 used to have extensive links to Chinese companies like TikTok-parent ByteDance and biotech firm BGI Geonomics. But the firm is now divesting those stakes in exchange for assured access to U.S. technologies that power AI, such as Nvidia's chips, Bloomberg reported in April.\nThe AI developer told Bloomberg at the time that G42's investment decisions stemmed from a wish to partner with the most sophisticated AI technology companies in the world\u2014the ones in the U.S.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Investing.com \u2013 The battle between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the title of the world's highest market capitalization has been ongoing since early January, when the iPhone maker ceded the crown to the company founded by Bill Gates, only to reclaim it on June 12. A few days later, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined the race, and with the help of artificial intelligence, managed to occupy the top spot for market cap worldwide, albeit for a single session.\nAfter all this confusion, order has been restored and as of June 21, the ranking is:\nMicrosoft: $3.312 trillion Apple: $3.215 trillion Nvidia: $3.214 trillion\nDespite the absolute gap of almost $100 billion between the first and the third, at the exorbitant levels of these three US tech giants, the difference is actually minimal, to the point that the ranking could change again from one session to the next.\nBeyond its historic and updated offering of software and digital services, one of Microsoft's strengths is that it was among the first to believe in the potential of Artificial Intelligence, heavily investing in OpenAI, a company that in the last six months has more than doubled its annualized revenue, rising to $3.4 billion from $1.6 billion at the end of 2023.\nApple's growth over the years has been long and relentless, with its stock always overcoming temporary corrections and continuing to hit new all-time highs. The Cupertino company that revolutionized the communication world with the iPhone, has become much more than a smartphone manufacturer over the years and has successfully ridden the wave of artificial intelligence by integrating it seamlessly into its iOS operating system.\nThe days when Nvidia was considered only a gaming company are long gone. Its revenues in the first quarter of 2024 rose by 265% compared to the same period last year, and its stock has soared by 170% in the last six months. In the semiconductor market, Nvidia is the absolute queen, and companies, including Microsoft and Apple, compete to secure its essential chips for training the language models that underpin generative artificial intelligence.\nIn short, all three companies have what it takes to remain where they are, but which of the three is favored at the moment?\nHere is the ranking based on the target price set by analysts:\nSource: InvestingPro\nAmong the three, analysts interviewed by InvestingPro show the most belief in Microsoft's potential. The target price is set at $480 per share, 7.7% higher than the $419.7 closing price on June 20.\nIn the case of Apple, analysts estimate a target price slightly lower by 1.5% compared to the current value.\nFinally, Nvidia could lose the most with a target price of $126.75, 3.1% less than the price on June 20.

The core of the legal dispute is the infringement of ParTec patents relating to the dynamic modular system architecture (dMSA) that ParTec developed and uses worldwide in the construction of powerful leading-edge AI-supercomputers. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, an injunction against the use of the patented technology as well as license fees and compensation for damages.\nEnd of Inside Information\nInformation and Explanation of the Issuer to this announcement:\nExplanatory part:\nParTec AG and BF exaQC AG hold a total of approximately 150 patents and patent applications worldwide. One of the most important patents is ParTec's dMSA patent, US Patent 10,142,156. The dynamic Modular System Architecture (dMSA) approach is a unique selling point of ParTec AG. It has proven itself in particular for the complex requirements of massive computing power in artificial intelligence such as AI training and inference and is fundamental for the dynamic interaction of CPUs and GPUs and other processors in supercomputers.\nThe importance of ParTec AG's patents is demonstrated by their use in world-leading, modern European supercomputers such as Leonardo in Bologna, JUWELS and JUPITER in J\u00fclich or Meluxina in Luxembourg, all of which were built on the basis of dMSA and are internationally regarded as pioneering. In addition, ParTec AG is already in negotiations with a well-known American chip manufacturer for the licensing of patents, as well as in contact with US authorities for use in the world\u2018s largest exaFlop Supercomputer under construction. In the past ParTec also licensed the patents in a deal worth millions in Europe for the construction of modular supercomputers.\n\"Microsoft is infringing our intellectual property with its wave of AI supercomputers as part of their cloud computing platform Azure. We have therefore decided to file a lawsuit in Texas, USA,\" explains Bernhard Frohwitter, CEO of ParTec AG and BF exaQC AG.\nLeading US law firm Susman Godfrey L.L.P. is representing the ParTec and BF exaQC in this litigation, led by partner Justin Nelson.\nAbout ParTec AG:\nParTec AG specializes in the development and manufacture of modular High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems and Quantum Computers (QC) as well as accompanying system software. Its offering also includes consulting and support services in all areas of the development, construction, and operation of these advanced systems.

        "Author": "  Brody Ford ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc.\u2019s new Chief Executive Officer Sridhar Ramaswamy is looking for deals in artificial intelligence to stay competitive with peers like closely held Databricks Inc. and the cloud computing giants.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBehind \u2018Suicide Squad,\u2019 the Year\u2019s Biggest Video-Game Flop\nReal Estate Investors Are Wiped Out in Bets Fueled by Wall Street Loans\nBillionaire-Friendly Modi Humbled by Indians Who Make $4 a Day\nVietnam Tycoon Sentenced to Death Faces New Charges: Media\nA Struggling Business Park Deals a Blow to Singapore's Regional Hub Ambitions\nThe data analytics provider was in talks to acquire startup Reka AI for more than $1 billion, but the discussions fizzled without a deal. Snowflake released its own large language model, Arctic, in April, and lets customers use LLMs from other companies like OpenAI on its platform. In May, Snowflake announced it would hire about 35 employees from AI-oriented startup TruEra, which last raised $25 million in 2022.\n\u201cWe will be on the lookout for acquisitions opportunistically,\u201d Ramaswamy said in an interview, adding that Snowflake will also work to hire top AI talent. \u201cThe number of people, in my opinion, that can train truly world-class foundation models right now is vanishingly small \u2014 I would say like a couple hundred people.\u201d\nRamaswamy, a former Google executive and co-founder of search startup Neeva, became Snowflake\u2019s CEO earlier this year. His chief task is to resuscitate revenue growth, which has been buffeted by tight corporate technology budgets. One part of the effort has been to invest in AI.\nStill, investors have soured on Snowflake since sales growth rates have dropped from 69% in the year ended January 2023 to an estimated 24% in the current fiscal year, which ends in January 2025. The shares have plunged 31% this year, closing Monday at $136.93 in New York.\nCompetition with Databricks in certain areas means Snowflake needs to improve some functions, such as the ability to easily use data stored in different places, Ramaswamy said. Databricks has said sales of its data warehousing product, which goes head-to-head with Snowflake, jumped 200% in the previous year, ending 2023 at a $250 million annual revenue run rate.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the business of storing data and getting insights from it, we\u2019re just a much easier and more pleasant way to do it as opposed to needing to stitch together multiple services in order to do the same thing,\u201d Ramaswamy said when asked about competition with Databricks.\nAt Snowflake\u2019s annual customer conference Tuesday, the company announced products to help users access and analyze data stored in more places. It is also expanding support for Iceberg, a data storage method first created by Netflix Inc., which has become more popular in recent years. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of leaning into it very heavily because we think it\u2019s what customers want,\u201d Ramaswamy said.\nInvestors are primarily focused on Snowflake\u2019s relevance in AI and competitive positioning against Databricks and cloud infrastructure giants like Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Amazon Web Services, Brad Zelnick, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote before the conference. \u201cWe believe it will be important for management to address some of these topics and rightly or wrongly perceived threats head on.\u201d\nAs for competition with the cloud providers, Ramaswamy said Snowflake\u2019s products are better than comparable ones from Microsoft and Amazon, though their tools are \u201cgoing to get better and so we need to keep improving our core product as well.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nSam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Meta Platforms vs. Microsoft",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) have enjoyed varying fortunes on the stock market in the past year.\nMeta stock has jumped 82% in the past year as compared to the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's return of 37%. Microsoft, meanwhile, has gained just 29%. That seems a bit surprising as Microsoft kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) wave by partnering with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and has been quick to deploy AI applications across its portfolio.\nMeta has also been integrating AI tools into its family of social media apps and is driving tangible gains for advertisers who are using AI to create, manage, and optimize their ad campaigns. Here's a closer look at the AI prospects of both Meta and Microsoft and which one of these two is worth buying right now.\nThe biggest AI-related revenue opportunity for Meta Platforms lies in the digital advertising market. According to a survey by software-as-a-service provider Kaltura, 69% of marketing departments are paying for AI tools already and another 29% are considering deploying the technology soon.\nNot surprisingly, Grand View Research estimates that the adoption of AI in the marketing space could increase at an annual rate of nearly 27% through the end of the decade, generating annual revenue surpassing $82 billion at the end of the forecast period. Meta Platforms offers AI tools to advertisers so they can target the relevant audience and drive greater returns on the ad dollars they spend.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Meta's April earnings conference call that the revenue generated by its Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns \"has more than doubled since last year.\" Additionally, Meta's AI tools are helping advertisers automate some of the steps in the ad campaign creation process.\nThe good part is that Meta is witnessing an improvement in the adoption of these AI-focused tools by advertisers, which explains why its ad impressions and revenue are increasing nicely. In the first quarter of 2024, Meta's ad impressions were up 20% compared to the year-ago period. There was a 6% year-over-year increase in the average price per ad. As a result, the company's ad revenue increased nearly 27% year over year to $35.6 billion.\nMeta's overall revenue was up by a similar figure to $36.4 billion. Given that the ad business accounts for almost all of Meta's top line, the growing adoption of AI in the digital ad market bodes well for the company's future. Meta claims that AI is helping drive a 32% increase in returns on the ad dollar spent by advertisers. So, it won't be surprising to see more advertisers turning to the company's offerings, especially considering that its family of apps has a daily active user base of 3.24 billion.\nWhat's more, catalysts such as AI are expected to drive stronger annual bottom-line growth of 30% for the next five years. That would be a nice acceleration over the 11% earnings growth Meta has clocked in the past five years. So, this tech stock could deliver more upside thanks to AI, which won't be surprising. Deutsche Bank predicts that the company could gain a bigger share of the digital ad market because of this technology.\nMicrosoft stock may have underperformed the broader tech sector in the past year, but the company is a solid bet on the proliferation of AI. From cloud computing to personal computers (PCs) to gaming, Microsoft has multiple AI-related catalysts that could accelerate its growth in the long run.\nFor instance, the company's cloud computing market share has started improving thanks to AI. In the first quarter of 2024, Microsoft's cloud market share stood at 25%, up by 2 percentage points from the year-ago period. CEO Satya Nadella credited this improvement to AI when discussing the company's fiscal 2024 third-quarter results in April:\nAzure again took share as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from Nvidia, AMD, as well as our own first-party silicon. Our AI innovation continues to build on our strategic partnership with OpenAI; more than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI service.\nIt is worth noting that the number of $100 million-plus deals for Microsoft's Azure cloud platform increased a whopping 80% on a year-over-year basis in the previous quarter. Additionally, the number of $10 million-plus deals doubled from the year-ago period. All this bodes well for Microsoft as Fortune Business Insights estimates that the market for cloud-based AI services could grow from $60 billion in 2023 to $398 billion in 2030.\nMicrosoft is already capitalizing on this lucrative opportunity as its Azure cloud revenue was up 31% year over year in the previous quarter, with AI accounting for 7 percentage points of that growth.\nMeanwhile, the emergence of AI-enabled PCs presents another monetization opportunity for Microsoft. The company's Copilot chatbot is now available on 225 million PCs. The company is offering various subscription plans targeted toward personal users (for $20 a month per user), business users, and enterprise customers (both $30 a month per user). The good part is that customers are willing to pay for a Copilot subscription, with the number of GitHub developers on a Copilot subscription increasing 35% quarter over quarter in fiscal Q3 to 1.8 million.\nAnalysts are expecting Copilot to generate at least $10 billion in annual revenue by next year, but it won't be surprising to see that milestone arriving earlier as the market for AI assistants is expected to see almost 33% annual growth over the next five years, generating annual revenue of $61 billion in 2029 from this year's estimate of $15 billion, as per Mordor Intelligence.\nNot surprisingly, Microsoft's earnings growth is forecast to accelerate, thanks to the multibillion-dollar AI opportunities discussed above.\nThough Microsoft has underperformed Meta in the past year, it remains the more expensive stock. Microsoft trades at 13.5 times sales and 37 times trailing earnings. Meta, on the other hand, has a price-to-sales ratio of 9 and trailing earnings multiple of 27.\nIt is also worth noting that Meta is growing at a faster pace than Microsoft right now, as the latter's revenue was up 17% in the previous quarter to $62 billion and earnings jumped 20% year over year. As a reminder, Meta's revenue was up 27% in the previous quarter, while its earnings more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $4.71 per share.\nSo, Meta looks like the better bet of these two AI stocks based on its current growth rates and valuation. However, Microsoft seems the more diversified bet of the two, which is why investors who are willing to look past its rich valuation can consider buying shares of this tech giant as well.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 6th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Israel Englander\u00a0is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund\u2019s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg\u2019s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium\u2019s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander\u2019s imposition of \u201ctight guardrails\u201d to limit losses. \u00a0To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. \u00a0A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d\nThe FT report said Englander\u2019s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,\u00a0 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\nBillionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Stake Value:\u00a0$1,176,438,300\nMicrosoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is strongly positioned to benefit from the AI revolution sweeping across both software and hardware industries. The stock has a new growth catalyst in the form of AI PCs. Piper Sandler analysts Brent Bracelin, Hannah Rudoff and J.R. Herrera \u00a0recently said in a note that Copilot Plus PCs could \u201cspark a long-anticipated PC upgrade cycle.\u201d They have a $465 price target with an Overweight rating on the stock.\nDuring the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0revenue jumped 17% year over year to $61.85 billion, while its adjusted EPS saw growth of 20%. \u00a0Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0Intelligent Cloud revenue growth came in at 21% on a YoY basis. \u00a0Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cloud market share also grew to 25%, and the company is slowly but surely catching up to Amazon, which has about 31% market share. Analysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to the company\u2019s integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0earnings to grow 12.50% next year. Based on the growth catalysts mentioned above, the stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels.

        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains the stock market\u2019s most valuable company, worth $3.15 trillion. That\u2019s a mind-boggling number. But how long will it hold onto the top spot of trillion-dollar stocks?\nBoth Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fight for the second sport with both worth about $3 trillion. Apple is No. 2 as of this writing, but that was flip-flopping last week as the chipmaker surged to surpass the consumer tech giant briefly.\nOnly six companies out of the thousands that trade on the market are worth $1 trillion or more. Several are within shouting distance of the threshold. Below are three stocks that could be the next trillion-dollar stocks to buy.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\nAt a market valuation of $418 million, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is less than halfway to the goal. Yet, it is well within the realm of possibility for the credit card processor to reach a $1 trillion valuation.\nOver the past decade, Mastercard stock has appreciated at a 17.5% compounded annual rate. That suggests that if it continues at that pace, Mastercard could cross the finish line within five years. And we\u2019re not talking about some tech stocks (all six existing trillion-dollar stocks are technology stocks). This is a mature, rather mundane business of processing payment transactions, which underscores the health and strength of Mastercard.\nA bet on Mastercard becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2035 is a bet on the long-term growth in U.S. consumer spending and an ever-expanding U.S. economy. Both seem like even-money bets.\nNot that it will be a straight shot. A recession could slow its growth. Total household non-housing debt stands at a record $4.87 trillion. Overall, Mastercard stock seems an easy pick for hitting a trillion-dollar valuation.\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nHealth insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is an even likelier candidate for achieving a $1 trillion valuation than Mastercard. The 10-year stock return for UNH stock is higher than that of the payments processor, at over 500%. That means it could cross the threshold sooner than Mastercard. Its growth could accelerate.\nThe healthcare industry has been under enormous pressure due to the pandemic, inflation and labor shortages. Industry analysts at McKinsey say the tide is turning, especially in the managed care population. Patients who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare represents \u201cone of the most substantial opportunities for payers.\u201d\nUnitedHealth is seeing robust growth in Medicare Advantage revenue, which grew almost 3% in the first quarter to $7.7 billion from the year-ago period. It was up sequentially from the fourth quarter as well. Medicaid revenue, however, was down sharply year-over-year. The insurer also saw a slight improvement in Medicare supplemental revenue compared to last year.\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s revenue rose $8 billion in the quarter to almost $100 billion. Although it reported a net loss of $1.53 per share, that was wholly due to selling its Brazilian sale and the impact of a cyberattack it suffered. Look for UnitedHealth\u2019s performance to improve as these one-time costs move into the rearview mirror and it expands into new lines of business.\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\nAt over $574 billion, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is already more than halfway there. The stock of the financial industry giant is up over 17% in 2024 and 42% higher over the last 12 months. At these growth rates, it could achieve trillion-dollar status in no time.\nHowever, its 10-year growth rate is substantially lower than that of either Mastercard or UnitedHealth, so investors should not expect that pace to continue. Still, there seems little doubt the country\u2019s biggest bank will reach that valuation.\nIt is already benefiting from the Federal Reserve\u2019s higher-for-longer interest rate policies. Higher rates boost JPMorgan\u2019s net interest income (NII), which surged 19% last year to $24.2 billion as the Fed raised rates an unprecedented 11 times between 2022 and 2023. NII was up another 11% in the first quarter of 2024.\nFed bank presidents, however, recently expressed doubts about any rate cuts coming soon.\u00a0They want sustained progress on inflation, not just a one-quarter improvement. The May jobs report showed that 272,000 new jobs were created, well ahead of expectations of 180,000 new jobs. That puts the prospects for a rate cut even more in doubt.\nLast year, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck called JPMorgan an \u201cunderappreciated rate play\u201d and said she saw the bank becoming a trillion-dollar stock. Her timeline, though, was 12 years down the road, maybe eight if it cut costs or increased the rate of revenue growth. JPM might not cross the threshold faster than some other companies, but it seems clear the bank will eventually be worth $1 trillion.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has told more than a dozen state agencies and public universities in Texas that Russian state-sponsored hackers accessed emails between them and the software giant.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBiden Struggles to Contain Mounting Pressure to Drop Out of Race\nHouse Democrats Consider Demanding Biden Withdraw From Race\nChina Can End Russia\u2019s War in Ukraine With One Phone Call, Finland Says\nKamala Harris Is Having a Surprise Resurgence as Biden\u2019s Campaign Unravels\nUS Allies Say China Is Developing Attack Drones for Russia\nThe attackers were able to gain access to the communications through a breach of Microsoft, disclosed in January, in which they stole emails from some of the company\u2019s executives. The agencies that Microsoft warned of exposure in the attack include the Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Workforce Commission, Texas Department of Motor Vehicles, Texas General Land Office and the Texas State Securities Board, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss it.\nMicrosoft has blamed a hacking group it calls Midnight Blizzard, which is tied to Russian intelligence services, for the attack.\nThe state and Microsoft are still examining the effect of the breach. An official with the Texas cybersecurity agency, Steve Pier, acknowledged on Friday the exposure of state emails, but said that so far they appear to be only routine administrative communications.\nNews of the Texas agencies being impacted by the Microsoft hack offers a fuller view of the range of the compromise, and it raises concerns about a US adversary potentially accessing sensitive information about employees, financial matters or critical infrastructure in one of the country\u2019s most populous and economically important states.\n\u201cTo be clear, the state of Texas was not breached. Microsoft was breached, which has involved some state of Texas emails,\u201d Pier, of the Texas Department of Information Resources, said in a statement. He said his agency first heard about the exposures from Microsoft this week and is still assessing the number of affected entities.\nMicrosoft declined to say which customers were receiving notices about the attack. \u201cWe will continue to coordinate, support and assist our customers in taking mitigating measures,\u201d a company spokesperson said Friday.\nMicrosoft told the General Land Office on Monday that the hackers got hold of 11 of its emails to the technology giant, according to Kimberly Hubbard, a spokesperson for the Texas agency, who said the messages were mostly about technical support.\n\u201cThere was nothing in those emails that contained sensitive or confidential information or information that a threat actor could leverage to attack us,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cWe have not seen any signs of system access or subsequent attacks to our network related to this Microsoft incident.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Workforce Commission, Sarah Fischer, said Microsoft told the agency on Wednesday that its \u201cemail systems were impacted\u201d but didn\u2019t say what the hackers may have accessed.\nRepresentatives of the Department of Transportation and Securities Board didn\u2019t respond Friday to requests for comment. A Department of Motor Vehicles spokesperson declined to comment.\nIn January, Microsoft announced that hackers had stolen senior leaders\u2019 emails that they were using to try to break into customers\u2019 communications, including those of government agencies. The company this week told additional customers that their emails were accessed by the hackers, and began providing previously notified clients with details of what was taken.\nThe company pinned the breach on a group that US and UK authorities have said is part of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. Midnight Blizzard is also referred to as APT 29 and Cozy Bear.\nIt remains unclear how many other Microsoft clients were exposed. In April, US federal agencies were ordered to analyze emails, reset compromised credentials and work to secure Microsoft cloud accounts amid concerns that the hackers may have accessed correspondence.\nThe fallout from the breach is coming into fuller view as the Redmond, Washington-based company is facing a series of high-profile and damaging security failures that have drawn strong condemnation from the US government.\nIn April, a government review board issued a scathing report that criticized Microsoft for having an \u201cinadequate\u201d security culture and cited Midnight Blizzard as evidence that the company hadn\u2019t yet fixed the problem.

        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Microsoft violated European Union antitrust rules with \u201cpossibly abusive\u201d practices by tying its Teams messaging and videoconferencing app to its widely used business software, the bloc said.\nThe European Commission said Monday it informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that the U.S. tech giant has been \u201crestricting competition\u201d by bundling Teams with core office productivity applications such as Office 365 and Microsoft 365.\nThe commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said it suspects Microsoft might have granted Teams a \u201cdistribution advantage\u201d by not giving customers a choice on whether to have Teams when they purchased the software. The advantage might have been widened by limits on the ability of rival messaging apps to work with Microsoft software, it said.\n\u201cWe are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president for competition policy, said in a statement.\n\u201cAnd preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets.\u201d\nThe commission took aim at Microsoft a day after accusing Apple of breaching the bloc's new digital competition rulebook, in a flurry of regulatory action underlining Brussels' leading role as a watchdog for Big Tech companies.\nMicrosoft made some changes last year in an effort to head off an penalty, including offering the software packages without Teams for European customers. But the commission said Tuesday the changes are not enough to address its concerns and that it needs to do more to \"restore competition.\"\n\u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2018s remaining concerns.\u201d Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a prepared statement.\nIn April, the company also gave customers worldwide the option to get Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams. The two software suites include programs like Word, Excel and Outlook.\nMicrosoft now has a chance to respond to the accusations, formally known as a statement of objections, before the commission makes its final decision. The company could face a fine worth up to 10% of its annual global revenue, or be forced to carry out \u201cremedies\" to satisfy the competition concerns.\nThe commission opened its investigation in July 2023 after rival Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint with Brussels. Alfaview, which makes videoconferencing software, also filed a separate complaint.\nSlack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, had alleged that Microsoft abused its market dominance to eliminate competition \u2014 in violation of EU laws.\n\u201cThe Statement of Objections issued today by the European Commission is a win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft\u2019s practices with Teams have harmed competition,\u201d Salesforce President Sabastian Niles said. \u201cWe appreciate the Commission\u2019s thorough investigation of Slack\u2019s complaint and urge the Commission to move towards a swift, binding, and effective remedy that restores free and fair choice and promotes competition, interoperability, and innovation in the digital ecosystem.\u201d\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) business has been on a roll. Importantly, its Azure cloud business jumped by 31% year over year in the most recent quarter. Sales from its suite of Office products also jumped by double digits. Personal computing-related devices and services also increased by 17%.\nThat helps explain why Microsoft shares have jumped by more than 30% over the past year. The move higher has brought the company's market capitalization to over $3 trillion. But one Wall Street analyst already sees the $4 trillion mark on the horizon.\nNew Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu just initiated coverage on the tech giant with a \"buy\" rating and a $570 price target. That stock price would represent a gain of 33% from recent levels and give Microsoft a market cap of more than $4.2 trillion.\nFerragu noted that a key part of Microsoft's success has been monetizing its cloud business, which has helped drive profitability higher. He expects more of the same to continue driving the stock higher. But now Microsoft has an added catalyst, too.\nMicrosoft quickly partnered with OpenAI when that company set off the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ferragu thinks the company is in a good position with its Copilot AI offering. He thinks AI alone \"could boost growth by several points every year, and for many years.\"\nMicrosoft's strong legacy business makes it a stock that most investors should want to hold. But that strength, and the potential for future profits from AI, make it a fairly expensive one, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the mid-30s. That makes it a good candidate to buy in stages over time, increasing ownership as the market cycles.\nBut it is likely that eventually, Ferragu will be right, and Microsoft will one day be a $4 trillion company.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

It\u2019s more than evident now that just a handful of technology companies account for most of the gains in the market, thanks to the AI-fueled rally that is favoring only those companies that are leading in the AI arms race. Barclays analyst Venu Krishna recently said in a report that \u201cBig Tech\u201d has \u00a0\u201clargely carried the broader U.S. equity market through 1Q24 earnings results.\u201d Krishna said that Q1 results showed the \u201congoing dominance\u201d of Big Tech over earnings revisions and margin upside.\n\u201cThis makes it difficult to argue for a broadening of overweight allocations,\u201d Krishna added. The analyst said this dominance comes at the expense of other sectors as funds cut their exposure to cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and discretionary to go overweight on tech.\nBillionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s New AI Fund\nBillionaires and VCs are now planning to create their own AI-focused funds to attract money from investors and tap into the unprecedented opportunities unlocked by AI. Bloomberg recently reported that Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management is planning to raise about $1 billion to make a new AI-focused hedge fund. The fund will bet \u201con and against\u201d companies in AI hardware and semiconductor industries. The report said that billionaire Cohen will be overseeing the fund along with Eric Sanchez.

The firm set a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT).\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working.

While the adoption of GenAI remains in its early stages, Microsoft has disclosed positive initial data points with 53,000 Azure AI customers as of its December quarter up from 18,000 in the prior quarter, 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers (up 30% sequentially) and more than 230,000 organizations who have used AI capabilities in the power platform (up 80% sequentially).

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "American tech giant Microsoft has come under the spotlight amid rising geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, as US lawmakers questioned the company over its ties to the world's second largest economy.\nBrad Smith, Microsoft president since 2015, disclosed that China only accounted for around 1.5 per cent of its global revenue, but said there are reasons for the company to stay even as the size of its mainland-based engineering team has been reduced.\nThe reasons for Microsoft to continue its China operations were \"to protect American information and trade secrets of American companies who are doing business in China\" and to \"ensure that [it is] always learning from what's going on in the rest of the world\", Smith said last week during congressional testimony over computer hacks last year that were linked to China.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Smith told the hearings that the words were \"not [his] statement\".\nSmith said there were areas in China deemed by Microsoft as \"appropriate and important\" to participate in, but that he did not use the words in the quote.\nHowever, the quote and Smith's visit to China were widely reported by local media as Beijing seeks to lure more foreign investment in the country.\n\"It's been increasingly hard for American companies to operate in China given the rising geopolitical tension between the two countries,\" said Thomas Liu, founder and CEO of the consultancy Policy Nexus. \"But in the long run, China and the US will benefit from cooperating with each other rather than a conflict.\"\nEven while maintaining its presence on the mainland, Microsoft has been reducing its China-based engineering team. Smith confirmed that the company is offering to relocate 700 to 800 employees from it China operations overseas. The Post reported in May that some local staff, including those from the Azure cloud computing unit, were offered new work locations such as the US, Australia and Ireland.\nPeople walk near a company logo at a Microsoft office building in Beijing, China, 05 August 2020.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 25, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Vistra Energy Corp. VST, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT and Macy's M.\nWith just a few trading days left, Wall Street has been on a remarkable rally, buoyed by a surge in technology stocks. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze, hopes of rate cuts, optimism over a resilient economy, improving corporate earnings and the rising share of the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been driving the space. Notably, the technology sector is the clear leader of the 2024 market rally so far.\nThe Nasdaq Composite emerged as an outperformer, gaining 17.8%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial have risen 14.6% and 3.9%, respectively. The strong trend is likely to continue in the second half as well.\nLet\u2019s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:\nThe AI boom will continue to fuel the rally in the broad market, with companies investing huge sums in the technology sector and beyond. The expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh growth opportunities. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030.\nAI is bolstering electricity demand, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. A simple ChatGPT task uses 10 times the energy a normal Google search does. So, data centers with a capacity of 30 megawatts are boosting capacity to handle 300 megawatts of power. This has made the traditional utilities sector of the market most appealing. Though technology seems to have become expensive, utilities remain an untapped area.\nInvestors seeking to make the most of the next leg in the AI industrial revolution should consider utility stocks. Vistra Energy Corp., having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the best-performing stocks of the first half. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 47 cents for this year over the past month, with an estimated growth rate of 13.7%. Vistra Energy has a Growth Score of B, indicating that it is poised for more growth. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is the biggest engine of growth for the technology sector and the S&P 500 as a whole. It now accounts for 31% of weightage in the S&P 500. The three stocks \u2014 NVIDIA, Apple and Microsoft \u2014 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group are in a race to become the world\u2019s most valuable company and hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion on surging enthusiasm over AI capabilities.\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of building AI into its products and services. Its success is largely attributed to its leadership in developing advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally catching up following the launch of the brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence at its recent Worldwide Developers Conference. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into AI in a bid to turbocharge its growth, particularly its cloud computing services, and is now reaping the fruits. About 65% of Fortune 500 companies are using the Azure service that delivers OpenAI's technology to businesses. Demand for generative AI will continue to fuel Microsoft's cloud business.\nApple and Microsoft have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.\nThe S&P 500 is on track to record its best first-half performance during an election year since 1976, as well as the second-best performance in an election year in its history, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The index has achieved multiple records and gained at least 500 points in the first six months. The index topped the 5,500 level for the first time last week after hitting the 5,400 threshold earlier this month and 5,300 last month, underscoring strong confidence. It broke the milestones of 5,100 and 5,200 in February.\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on the stock market. An analyst at Stifel expects the S&P 500 to reach the 6,000 mark before the end of 2024, up from just below 5,500, as investors keep piling in. This month, an analyst at Goldman boosted the year-end target price for the S&P 500 Index to 5,600 from 5,200 for the third time, citing an optimistic outlook for earnings growth and the U.S. economy.\nMeanwhile, Evercore ISI, one of the prominent bear analysts, turned bullish and raised its year-end S&P 500 price target from 4,750 to 6,000 \u2014 a new high on Wall Street. The analyst stated that the \"AI revolution is in the early innings\" and should lead to continued strength in earnings growth. Evercore ISI forecasts S&P 500 EPS growth of 8% and 5% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nMarket veteran Ed Yardeni expects the bull market to roar further until the end of this decade, with the S&P 500 on track to hit 6,000 by the end of 2025 and 8,000 by the end of the decade. Tom Lee, the founder of Fundstrat, expects that the S&P 500 could hit 15,000 by the end of this decade.\nIn the latest FOMC meeting, U.S. policymakers penciled in one rate cut for this year and foresee four cuts for 2025. The Fed altered language in its statement, noting there has been \u201cmodest further progress toward the committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective.\u201d Previously, the statement pointed to a \u201clack\u201d of further progress.\nLow rates reduce the cost of borrowing, which is often needed to finance the expansion of companies, thereby driving growth. This can positively impact sectors like real estate, consumer discretionary and financial services, which are typically sensitive to interest rate changes.\nIn real estate, lower rates can boost housing market activity by making mortgages more affordable. For consumer discretionary sectors, reduced borrowing costs can lead to increased consumer spending. In the financial sector, while lower rates can compress net interest margins for banks, they can also encourage lending and potentially lead to increased consumer and business loan activity.\nAs a result, investors could bet on any of these sectors to magnify gains for the rest of the year. In particular, the most beaten-down stocks of the first half could outperform in the second half. One exciting option could be Macy's, which sells a range of merchandise, such as apparel and accessories for men, women, and kids, cosmetics; home furnishings, and other consumer goods under the Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury brands.\nThe stock is down about 9% so far this year but has the potential to move higher in the second half of the year, given its Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. Additionally, Macy's saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending January 2025).\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 4, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices AMD, NVIDIA NVDA, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe fight for AI supremacy between Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA is escalating, with both launching new chips at Computex 2024.\nAMD is playing catch-up to NVIDIA's dominance in the AI space, which has been riding on strong spending as the digital transformation (DX) of enterprises continues. Per IDC estimates, worldwide spending on DX is forecast to reach roughly $4 trillion in 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2% between 2022 and 2027.\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. Generative AI (GenAI) software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\nThis massive splurge by enterprises presents significant growth opportunities for both chipmakers.\nBoth AMD and NVIDIA are now focusing on the faster launch of AI-enabled chips to stay ahead of the competition.\nAt Computex 2024, AMD unveiled its Instinct accelerator roadmap that includes the new Instinct MI325X accelerator, which is planned to be available in fourth-quarter 2024. Instinct MI325X accelerator features 288GB of ultra-fast HBM3E memory that extends AMD's GenAI performance footprint.\nThe next-generation CDNA 4 architecture, expected in 2025, will power the AMD Instinct MI350 Series. It is expected to drive up to 35X better AI inference performance compared to the AMD Instinct MI300 Series with AMD CDNA 3. The CDNA \"Next\" architecture will power MI400 series accelerators planned for 2026.\nAMD unveiled the fifth generation of EPYC server processors (Turin) that leverage the Zen 5 core. It further expanded its portfolio with the launch of the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\nAt Computex, Microsoft, HP, Lenovo and Asus unveiled new PCs powered by third-gen AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors and AMD Ryzen 9000 Series desktop processors.\nNVIDIA recently expanded its portfolio with the announcement of the next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin, which will leverage HBM4. This follows the March announcement of Blackwell, which is currently in production and is expected to ship to customers later this year.\nThe most valuable chip company now plans to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline. NVIDIA also announced a plethora of new tools and software models at Computex 2024.\nNVIDIA's yearly launch decision reflects the ongoing competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and its urgency to maintain its dominant position, which is not only threatened by AMD and Intel but also by initiatives taken by Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\nMicrosoft's Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes. The Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like large language model training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors.\nAlphabet's Google has introduced the Axion central processing unit (CPU) to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are its first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\nMeta followed Google to introduce the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta's AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\nNVIDIA has returned a whopping 121.4% year to date, outperforming AMD, Microsoft and Alphabet's growth of 13.2%, 10.4% and 23.5%, respectively.\nNVDA is enjoying dominance in the AI-space thanks to its next-generation chips with high computing power that have been the top choice for enterprises. However, AMD, with its latest products, seems well-equipped to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market over the long haul.\nNVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of A, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. A Momentum Score of B makes NVDA an attractive pick for investors. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nHowever, investors should wait for a better entry point for AMD, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the modest growth prospect in the near term. Moreover, AMD is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 40.11X compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry's 32.92X and NVIDIA's 38.12X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.
