        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone launch event on Monday, Sept. 9, at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.\nCEO Tim Cook is expected to headline the keynote, which will reportedly include the debut of the iPhone 16 lineup, the 10th anniversary edition of the Apple Watch, and updated AirPods.\nThat\u2019s a lot of hardware, but Wall Street isn\u2019t banking on new iPhones or special edition Apple Watches to move the company\u2019s stock price. Instead, all eyes will be on Apple\u2019s generative AI-powered Apple Intelligence platform.\nApple Intelligence is the company\u2019s big swing at bringing generative AI capabilities to consumers\u2019 iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Wall Street wasn\u2019t very keen on how long it took Apple to announce its AI initiative, waiting impatiently as Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted their own AI services for enterprises and consumers.\nBut investors changed their tune when Apple showed off Apple Intelligence at its WWDC developer conference in June, sending the company\u2019s stock price up around 15% and putting it ahead of Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Google for year-to-date performance.\nApple is setting up Apple Intelligence as one of the main selling points for its latest phones, as its software will only run on last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro or newer phones. And analysts are banking on that exclusivity to reinvigorate iPhone sales.\n\u201cApple Intelligence remains the key to unlocking pent-up iPhone demand and accelerating replacement cycle, and we expect Apple's\u2026 event to heavily feature AI integration on the new iPhone 16,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note.\nBut Apple Intelligence could prove to be something more important than a catalyst for iPhone sales. It will also serve as a make-or-break moment for generative AI in the eyes of everyday consumers.\nTake one look at Apple\u2019s invitation for its Sept. 9 show, and it\u2019s clear the company is going all in on AI. From the \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d tagline to the multicolor Apple logo meant to evoke Siri\u2019s revamped look, the company is sending the message that this show will be an AI showcase.\nApple is pouring AI into its software products with features that summarize text message threads, surface priority emails in the Mail app, provide an improved Siri experience, and enable access to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nApple is also including AI staples like writing tools to help gussy up your emails and documents by proofreading your text or reworking it to sound more professional or concise. The company is also expecting developers to jump on board the AI train, building out new apps that take advantage of the technology through Apple\u2019s devices.\n\u201cWe estimate this could result in incremental Services high margin growth annually of $10 billion for Apple as this all kicks in and will be the start of a new multi-pronged AI revenue stream that is both hardware and software driven,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note.\n\u201cWe believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front,\u201d Ives added. And with that, a $30 to $40 per share bump \u2014 pushing the company\u2019s market cap to the $4 trillion mark.\nApple isn\u2019t the only company to bring generative AI to its smartphone line. Samsung has Galaxy AI software, combining its own AI with some of Google\u2019s AI smarts. Google also offers its own Gemini AI platform via its new Pixel 9 line of devices, including its Pixel 9 Pro Fold foldable phone.\nApple, however, has done a far better job explaining its AI offerings than either of its competitors. It made the software seem like a must-have for users during its June developer conference, explaining how it integrates across the company\u2019s various apps and services in a way that Samsung and Google haven\u2019t been able to by making AI seem more personal.\nBut Apple is going to have to do more than that to get people excited about its AI efforts. I\u2019ve been using Apple\u2019s beta software on my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and while I appreciate its ability to summarize long text message threads between friends \u2014 no one likes having to sift through 40 messages to find out what they\u2019re doing for dinner \u2014 and find the priority email feature in Mail helpful, it\u2019s difficult to say whether that will be enough to spark consumer interest in the technology.\nApple will also need to take great care to ensure that its Apple Intelligence is accurate and not prone to the kinds of hallucinations that have led to criticisms of AI software like Google\u2019s AI Overview, which famously told people to add glue to their pizza and to eat rocks.\nAbove all, Apple will need to ensure that Apple Intelligence is something that consumers actually want to use and not a feature the company had to shoehorn into its portfolio to placate investors fearing Apple would miss the boat on the next tech hype train.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Tech giant Apple has reportedly stepped back from participating in OpenAI's anticipated $6.5bn funding round, the Wall Street Journal has reported.\nThe decision comes amid a period of executive turnover at the artificial intelligence startup, which has seen several key figures depart.\nConcurrently, other tech companies such as Microsoft and NVIDIA are reportedly in discussions to contribute to the funding effort.\nMicrosoft previously invested close to $13bn in OpenAI and is speculated to commit an additional $1bn.\nThe publication noted that OpenAI, the entity behind the widely discussed ChatGPT, could reach a valuation exceeding $100bn due to the intense interest in AI across various industries.\nThe strategic imperative for companies to invest heavily in AI to maintain market competitiveness has propelled this valuation surge.\nFounded as a non-profit, OpenAI established a for-profit arm in 2019, though the non-profit board maintained significant influence over decisions.\nRecently, OpenAI announced that the company is considering a shift to a for-profit benefit corporation, which could diminish the non-profit's control and appeal to a broader investor base.\nThe non-profit arm is expected to retain a minority stake in the for-profit entity.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman is anticipated to receive equity in the for-profit branch, potentially valued at $150bn post-restructuring, as the company seeks to remove the cap on investor returns.\nThe proposed restructuring is still being finalised with legal and shareholder consultations, and the timeline for completion is currently uncertain\nAmidst these strategic changes, the recent C-suite departures is said to have cast uncertainty on OpenAI's future direction.\nRecently, OpenAI introduced its latest series of AI models with advanced reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems.\nThese models are engineered to deliberate more extensively on queries, enabling them to tackle more challenging problems across various domains.\n\"Apple reportedly withdraws from OpenAI funding round\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "Apple has received a warning from the European Union to make its iPhone and iPad operating systems (OS) compatible with rival technologies or face potential fines under the Digital Markets Act (DMA).\nThe EU\u2019s regulators have mandated that Apple comply with new regulations requiring full OS functionality with other technologies within six months.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Brussels-based authority's announcement stops short of a formal investigation but signals the EU's intent to force Apple to redesign its services, allowing competitors access to the iPhone's and iPad's operating systems.\nApple, headquartered in Cupertino, California, said it offers developers ways to request more interoperability with its operating systems, emphasising user security protection.\nThe company argued that compromising the security measures integrated into its systems over time would endanger European consumers.\nThe DMA's objectives include granting developers access to crucial Apple features, such as Siri voice commands and the payment chip.\nEU executive vice-president in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager said: \u201cToday is the first time we use specification proceedings under the DMA to guide Apple towards effective compliance with its interoperability obligations through constructive dialogue.\n\u201cWe are focused on ensuring fair and open digital markets. Effective interoperability, for example with smartphones and their operating systems, plays an important role in this. This process will provide clarity for developers, third parties and Apple.\n\u201cWe will continue our dialogue with Apple and consult third parties to ensure that the proposed measures work in practice and meet the needs of businesses.\u201d\nIf Apple fails to comply with the DMA, the EU may initiate a formal investigation, which could result in fines of up to 10% of Apple's global annual sales.\nIn addition to this warning, Apple is already under scrutiny in a parallel investigation concerning its App Store policies for developers, which could also incur significant penalties.\nEarlier this month, Apple unveiled the iPhone 16, hoping to attract customers with modest hardware improvements and forthcoming AI technology.\nIn June 2024, the US tech giant announced that certain features would be withheld from the EU market due to the DMA's stipulations on operating system compatibility with third-party applications.\n\"Apple faces EU compliance demand for iPhone OS \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

The base iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now come with the same programmable Action button found on last year's iPhone 15 Pro line.\nBoth the base iPhone 16s and the iPhone 16 Pros also get new dedicated touch-sensitive camera buttons that you can click to launch the camera app. You can then click again to take a photo or click and hold to take video.\nA light press on the button brings up a new overlay that allows you to access controls like zoom. Third-party apps like Snapchat are also taking advantage of the camera button to quickly share your shots.\nOverall, the $799 iPhone 16 and $899 iPhone 16 Plus look similar to last year's models, save for the way their rear cameras are arranged. They're now stacked vertically to allow for spatial photos for use with the Apple Vision Pro headset.\nInside, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get Apple's new 3-nanometer A18 chip, which includes a 2x faster neural engine. Apple says the A18's central processing unit is up to 30% faster than the one found in the iPhone 15 line and includes a 5-core GPU, which helps run Apple Intelligence, games, and camera features. Apple says the new chip will also improve the phone's battery life.\nThe iPhone 16s will also come equipped with computational photography software to create a 2x telephoto option that simulates an optical zoom via the standard wide-angle lens. The ultra-wide lens, meanwhile, gets upgraded to 48 megapixels.\nApple further says it's bringing visual intelligence to the camera app that allows you to take a photo of something like a restaurant to get reviews of the place or take a shot of a flyer for a concert and immediately add the info to your calendar. If you see a bike in person that you'd like to buy, you can capture a photo of it and then get a quick Google link to purchase it.\nThis sounds similar to Google's existing Circle to Search feature for Android phones.

The bigger displays come courtesy of thinner bezels that make the phone look more like a single sheet of glass from the front.\nBoth Pro phones come with Apple's new A18 Pro chip, offering better performance than the A18 found in the iPhone 16s. The processor's CPU is 15% faster than the A17 Pro and uses 20% less power.\nThe Pro and Pro Max also get more powerful 48-megapixel fusion cameras and 48-megapixel ultra-wide cameras. The Pro gets a new 5x optical zoom to match the Pro Max's capabilities. The iPhone 15 Pro only offered 3x zoom.\nLike the iPhone 16s, the Pros get the same camera controls via the new dedicated camera button, and later this year Apple will add a two-step shutter that locks onto a subject via a software update. You'll also now be able to shoot video in 4K 120 frames per second for slick slo-mo videos.

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. introduced the latest version of its flagship device, the iPhone 16, betting it can entice consumers with modest hardware upgrades and AI technology that\u2019s still on the horizon.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis\nHousing\u2019s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race\nFor Tenants, AI-Powered Screening Can Be a New Barrier to Housing\nAfter a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates\nChicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook unveiled the smartphone \u2014 alongside new watches and AirPods earbuds \u2014 at an event Monday that was infused with the promise of artificial intelligence. The iPhone 16 was built for AI \u201cfrom the ground up,\u201d he said, though the capabilities will only be gradually added to the device via software updates.\nListen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nIt\u2019s a gambit for the tech titan, which has been racing to develop a suite of tools called Apple Intelligence. Though Apple has been touting the technology since its developers conference in June, the software won\u2019t be included in the initial versions of the new iPhones. They\u2019re set to go on sale Friday, with the product reaching stores on Sept. 20.\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Apple software chief Craig Federighi said during the presentation. The first set of tools will be released as part of a beta test in October, he said, \u201cwith more features rolling out in the months to come.\u201d\nAs part of the event, Apple unveiled a version of its smartwatch with a bigger screen and the ability to detect sleep apnea. And it touted new software that can turn AirPods into hearing aids.\nThe iPhone debut was the centerpiece of the presentation, though the company only made relatively minor changes to the device\u2019s look and hardware features. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will be available in new colors and get a customizable Action button that had only been available on higher-end models. There\u2019s also a more powerful chip and new Camera Control button that lets users snap pictures and access camera functions.\nNew Pro models, meanwhile, will get slightly larger displays and thinner borders. They will run an A18 Pro processor with an upgraded neural engine \u2014 the part of the chip designed to handle AI tasks. The phones have more powerful camera components and video features, letting them capture higher-resolution photos and more cinematic slow-motion clips.\nApple is playing catch-up in the world of generative artificial intelligence, where tech peers like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp. have made strides. Monday\u2019s presentation was partly a pitch to consumers \u2014 and Wall Street \u2014 that Apple should be taken seriously in AI.\nBut the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s AI technology is still in early stages. The Apple Intelligence tools have faced numerous delays, and many key features won\u2019t arrive until next year. For now, the technology is focused on summarizing messages and notifications, rather than matching the gee-whiz capabilities of rival systems.\nApple shares slipped more than 1.5% during the event, though they rebounded later. That kind of ho-hum reaction is fairly typical during Apple presentations. Most new features are reported ahead of time, and there were few surprises during Monday\u2019s presentation.\nAI was a major theme of the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. local time. The company hopes to use the Apple Intelligence software to entice consumers to buy upgraded devices, since customers will need a recent iPhone to handle the capabilities.\nApple Intelligence will include an upgraded Siri digital assistant and the ability to create custom emoji with text prompts. The event\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d theme was a reference to the look of Siri\u2019s new interface.\nBut much of the technology won\u2019t be ready right away, potentially limiting its impact on iPhone sales. Even when Apple Intelligence debuts in October, it will be a beta test \u2014 an early version for more adventurous consumers.\nThat \u201cindicates a lot of the features are still being fine-tuned for release and not ready for prime time,\u201d eMarketer analyst Gadjo Sevilla said in a note. \u201cThe focus on security and privacy is a likely reason for feature delays.\u201d\nThe entry-level iPhone will continue to start at $799, with the Plus model selling for $899. The iPhone 16 Pro is $999, while the larger Pro Max version is $1,199.\nApple Watch\nThe new Apple Watch \u2014 the Series 10 edition \u2014 has 30% more screen area, even with a thinner design. The sleep apnea feature will be available in more than 150 regions, the company said.\nThe new watch is about 10% thinner than the Series 9 version. It also comes in a new titanium chassis that\u2019s lighter than aluminum models. The device starts at $399 and will be released Sept. 20. A new version of the higher-end Ultra version also was announced, and it goes on sale that day for $799.\nThe event included an updated version of the standard $129 AirPods, which shrinks the size of the case and adds a USB-C charger. A $179 version also will be available \u2014 a midrange product \u2014 with noise cancellation. That used to only be available on the higher-end AirPods Pro.\nThe company introduced a new line of $549 AirPods Max headphones in fresh colors, also with USB-C charging. Like the other products, the devices will be released on Sept. 20. Apple didn\u2019t debut a new version of its AirPods Pro, but introduced features such as a hearing test and the ability to act as a hearing aid. Those capabilities will be offered as a software update this fall.\nEvent Timing\nThe iPhone debut is usually Apple\u2019s most important announcement of the year.

        "Author": "  Michael Grothaus ",
        "Text": "iOS 18 has introduced many awesome new software features for the iPhone, particularly when it comes to productivity and privacy. Yet the best new software feature Apple has released this year isn\u2019t for the iPhone. It\u2019s for the Mac, and it\u2019s called iPhone Mirroring. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s so extraordinary. Plus, some tips on putting it to use.\nMost Read from Fast Company\nWhen Hurricane Helene hit, this disaster-proof Florida neighborhood kept the lights on\nHousing market shift: Here\u2019s where homebuyers are gaining power fast\nCandy and snack recall, FDA update: List of products that may be contaminated with salmonella\niPhone Mirroring is a new feature in macOS Sequoia that allows you to use your iPhone on your Mac. When you launch the new iPhone Mirroring app on your Mac, your Mac will automatically connect to your iPhone and display a digital twin version of it on your desktop.\nYou can interact with this digital twin of your iPhone using your Mac\u2019s keyboard, mouse, and trackpad. In other words, you can fully interact with your iPhone without even taking it out of your pocket.\nOnce your iPhone\u2019s digital twin is displayed on your Mac\u2019s desktop, you can do virtually anything with it that you can do on the iPhone itself. You can swipe through the iPhone\u2019s home screens, launch any app on your iPhone, and then use that iPhone app right on your Mac\u2019s desktop. This digital twin looks exactly like your real iPhone\u2014down to the arrangement of its apps, widgets, and wallpaper background.\niPhone Mirroring feels like magic. It is fluid and responsive and now gives you a way to use apps that are exclusive to the iPhone right on your Mac. For example, if you have a favorite messenger app that doesn\u2019t have a Mac counterpart, you can launch the iPhone Mirroring app on your Mac, open the messaging app in your iPhone\u2019s digital twin, and then use your Mac\u2019s keyboard to type out a reply to the last message you received.\nBut iPhone Mirroring goes even further. When you get a notification on your iPhone, that notification will appear in the Notification Center on your Mac. This means that if you are working at your desk, you no longer need to check your iPhone to see your notifications\u2014they\u2019ll appear instantly on your computer.\nThere are several situations in which iPhone Mirroring can come in handy. The first is when you are working at home and want to quickly use an app on your iPhone but you don\u2019t have it nearby. Instead of hunting down your iPhone (perhaps it\u2019s in your bedroom, charging) you can just launch iPhone Mirroring and do what you need to do.\nAnother great use case is when you are working in a public space like a coffee shop. Thieves love coffee shops because people often have their laptops and phones on the tabletop. It\u2019s relatively easy for an experienced thief to snatch our iPhone, especially when we are distracted by whatever we are working on on our MacBook. But now, you can now just leave your iPhone securely stored in your pocket the whole time, and if you do need to access information on it, you can simply launch its digital twin on your Mac.\nAnd yet another great use case is coming later this year. In a future software update, iPhone Mirroring will allow you to drag and drop files like documents, movies, and photos between your Mac and iPhone. For example, say you want to save a PDF copy of your boarding pass to your iPhone. Now you can just launch iPhone Mirroring on your Mac and drag the PDF from your Mac\u2019s desktop onto the digital twin of your iPhone and the file will instantly be added to your real iPhone. No more needing to email files to yourself.\niPhone Mirroring is one of those rare software features that makes you sit up and say \u201cwow\u201d when you use it for the first time\u2014and it\u2019s a feature that every Mac user should take advantage of.\niPhone Mirroring requires an Apple Silicon Mac or an Intel-based Mac with a T2 security chip running macOS Sequoia, as well as an iPhone running iOS 18.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

        "Title": "Apple begins testing AI software designed to bring a smarter Siri to the iPhone 16",
        "Author": "  MICHAEL LIEDTKE ",
        "Text": "Apple is giving more people the chance to test a software update that will implant artificial intelligence into its virtual assistant Siri and automate a variety of tedious tasks on the latest iPhone coming out Friday.\nThe free update was made available Thursday to an audience that has signed up to test Apple's software before it's released to all iPhone owners next month. As of Thursday, only two premium iPhones that came out last year contain the souped-up processor required to power the AI features included in the update, but that will change Friday when four new iPhone 16 models reach store shelves.\nAll the iPhone 16 models, with starting prices ranging from $800 to $1,200, are equipped to handle the new technology, which the company is marketing as \u201cApple Intelligence.\u201d That branding is part of an effort to distinguish the iPhone\u2019s AI from similar technology already available in smartphones released earlier this year by Samsung and Google.\nThe AI features are being promoted as one of the main reasons to buy an iPhone 16, so releasing a test version of the software powering the technology now may prod more consumers to splurge on one of the new models as soon as possible\nThe AI technology is coming out in U.S. English only for now, but will expand into localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. in December. Apple plans to expand into other languages and countries next year. The testing of the AI software is beginning just a few days after Apple released its latest mobile operating system, iOS 18, to all its earlier iPhones.\nOnce the iOS 18.1 upgrade is installed, the often bumbling Siri is supposed to become more conversational, versatile and colorful, with a glowing light that will rotate around the iPhone's screen as it responds to requests. While Apple is promising Siri will be able to perform more tasks and be less prone to becoming confused, it won't be able to interact with other apps installed on the iPhone until another software update comes out at a still-unspecified date.\nOther AI features in the software update will handle a variety of writing and proofreading tasks, summarize the content of emails and other documents. The AI also will provide a variety of editing tools to alter the appearance of photos and make it easier to find old pictures.\nBut the initial update doesn't include other AI tricks still to come, such as the ability to create customized emojis on the fly or conjure other fanciful imagery upon request. Apple also plans to eventually enable its AI suite to get a helping hand from OpenAI's ChatGPT when users want it.\nBesides the new iPhone model, Apple's AI features also will work last year's iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max because they have the special computer chip that's required. The update will also bring the ability to record spatial video on those two iPhone 15 models that can be watched on Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro headset.\nBut the AI won't work on hundreds of millions of other iPhones that are still in use, a drawback that investors are betting will juice Apple's recently slumping sales of the ubiquitous device.\nThat expectation is the main reason that Apple's stock price has climbed by more than 15% since the company previewed its AI strategy in June, creating $500 billion in shareholder wealth. Some analysts believe the demand for new iPhones could propel Apple's market value above $4 trillion for the first time within the next year.\n"

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. fans lined up at stores around the world for the new iPhone 16, shrugging off the fact that the device\u2019s signature feature \u2014 a new suite of AI tools \u2014 won\u2019t arrive until later.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes\nWaiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\nExclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\nNY\u2019s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\nThe company saw significant lines and waiting times at several major Apple retail stores globally, indicating a potentially strong start for the product. The company introduced the iPhone 16 lineup in almost 60 countries on Friday, including the US, China, India, Australia and South Korea.\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook greeted crowds at the company\u2019s location on Fifth Avenue in New York alongside Apple\u2019s head of retail, Deirdre O\u2019Brien. The store was outfitted with lights to mimic the new glowing interface of the Siri digital assistant. Other Apple outlets, including in Los Angeles, Australia and China, had notable lines of people picking up preordered phones or showing up without a reservation.\nThe device won\u2019t come installed with Apple Intelligence \u2014 the much-anticipated AI software that the company has been touting since June. That means users will have to download the software features over time as they become available during the coming weeks and months.\nThat\u2019s put Apple in a tricky spot. It\u2019s already marketing the AI features heavily, but some consumers may be wary about buying the new phones if they can\u2019t enjoy the benefits right away.\nGiven the strong initial buzz \u2014 even if it\u2019s driven in part by Apple die-hards who line up every year \u2014 the marketing tactic may be working.\nIn terms of its look and feel, the new iPhone isn\u2019t a major leap from prior models. A touch-sensitive Camera Control button, which makes it easier to take pictures and video, is the most notable change.\nEven so, Wall Street remains bullish that Apple can accelerate growth during the all-important holiday season. Analysts estimate that revenue will increase 8% in the December quarter \u2014 the best showing for that period since the end of calendar 2021.\nThe new lineup includes two standard models \u2014 the 16 and 16 Plus \u2014 as well as the higher-end Pro and Pro Max. Preorders of the devices began last week, ahead of shipments to stores and customers getting underway Friday.\nThe initial units going on sale will run the iOS 18 operating system, but Apple Intelligence will require an over-the-air update to the iOS 18.1 software, which is launching in October. Apple has outfitted its retail stores with machines called \u201cPresto\u201d that will allow the company to load up Apple Intelligence and other iOS updates in the future. That will let Apple skip the usual scenario where iPhones are sold with outdated software.\nApple Intelligence was announced in June at the company\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference and has been available in a limited beta test for developers over the past several weeks.\nOn Thursday, Apple released a public beta version of the software \u2014 one aimed at a wider audience \u2014 though most customers won\u2019t access it until the suite of features is released in its final form next month. Additional capabilities won\u2019t be ready until later, part of a staggered launch that will stretch into next year.\nWhen the technology titan introduced the iPhone 16 line, it said that the devices were the first to be built \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d for Apple Intelligence. But some iPhones from last year \u2014 the 15 Pro and Pro Max \u2014 will be able to support the features as well.\nThe look of the new phones is little changed from the iPhone 12 design from 2020. But they feature noticeable battery-life improvements and camera advancements \u2014 beyond the new button. Prices start at $799 for the standard iPhone, ranging up to $1,199 for the Pro Max. Even with modest hardware updates, the new phones could attract owners of much older models or switchers from Android devices.\nIn past years, consumers ordering phones from Apple\u2019s online store have seen major shipping delays \u2014 a sign that supply wasn\u2019t meeting demand. That\u2019s been less of an issue this year, either because orders are slower or Apple just has more phones on hand.\nNew orders of the regular iPhone 16 models will be delivered by early October, while the Pro versions will arrive around the middle of the month.\nApple also unveiled lower-end AirPods this month and updated watches. The new earbuds \u2014 dubbed AirPods 4 \u2014 are available in $129 and $179 versions, with the latter model including noise cancellation. That feature had previously been reserved for the upscale AirPods Pro, which cost $249.\nApple\u2019s latest smartwatches, meanwhile, don\u2019t offer a major reason to upgrade. The new Series 10 has a larger display and thinner design, but otherwise looks similar to the Series 9. The company\u2019s only change to the higher-end Ultra model, meanwhile, is a black color option. Still, the products could attract customers who have older Apple Watches or are new to the category.\nRead this next: Apple\u2019s $3.4 Trillion Value Is Just One Way It Can Set the Rules\nThe iPhone, watches and AirPods won\u2019t be the last new Apple products of 2024. The company also is planning a major Mac computer overhaul later this year.\nApple will bring its AI-focused M4 processor from the iPad to the MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktop. It\u2019s also preparing the most significant overhaul to the Mac mini in the product\u2019s two-decade history, complete with a smaller design and new chips.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Activision and Blizzard\u2019s Corporate Warcraft\nThis Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lineups hit the market on Sept. 20, and they bring a handful of updates that, if you\u2019re using an older iPhone, make them worth the upgrade. There\u2019s a new camera button, improved camera performance, bigger screens on the Pro models, and better battery life all around.\nI\u2019ve spent some time using both the iPhone 16, starting at $799, and the iPhone 16 Pro, starting at $999. If you\u2019re coming from an outdated iPhone, you\u2019ll appreciate the new phones\u2019 refinements. But the biggest upgrade to Apple\u2019s newest iPhones is the company\u2019s Apple Intelligence platform.\nAvailable as a software update in October \u2014 no, it\u2019s not launching alongside the phones \u2014 Apple Intelligence will bring a series of AI-powered features to the iPhone including a smarter Siri, AI-based writing tools for summarizing and rewriting your messages to fit a specific tone, and the option to summarize your notifications so you don\u2019t have to read through 57 unrelated texts to find out what time you and your friends are getting dinner tonight.\nTo use Apple Intelligence, however, you\u2019ll need to have either an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, or iPhone 16 Pro. If you\u2019ve got an iPhone 15, you\u2019re out of luck. Apple says the base 15 simply isn\u2019t powerful enough to run the Apple Intelligence software.\nApple is positioning Apple Intelligence as its next revolutionary product. And while it\u2019s too early to say whether that\u2019s true or not, after using a beta version of the software, I can say its new capabilities are certainly welcome additions to the iPhone.\nI can\u2019t say Apple Intelligence is the kind of thing that\u2019s worth upgrading your iPhone for just yet, but taken as a whole, the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro lines provide the right kind of improvements that make them solid updates.\nLet\u2019s talk about what\u2019s new to the iPhone 16 lineup. First is the new Camera Control button. A new way to launch and, well, control the camera, the Camera Control button is found on the lower right side of both iPhone 16s and iPhone 16 Pros.\nPress the button and you\u2019ll instantly launch the iPhone\u2019s Camera app. Gently double-press the button and it\u2019ll pull up the app\u2019s camera exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles, and tone options. Lightly tap the button again to dive deeper into each setting. Sure, you can already launch the camera app by swiping right or tapping the camera button from the iPhone\u2019s lock screen, but Camera Control makes it feel like you\u2019re using an old-school point-and-shoot camera. Man, referring to it like that makes me feel old.\nStill, it\u2019s true. Being able to take photos and shoot videos by pressing or pressing and holding the Camera Control button does make capturing your subjects as easy as using an old, dedicated camera. You don\u2019t have to move your finger around the screen to change the zoom level or adjust the exposure, losing your framing and risking dropping your iPhone. Is it the sole reason to upgrade? No, but it\u2019s a helpful addition to the iPhone.\nOn the camera front, Apple\u2019s new styles feature allows you to adjust the look of your shot from stark black and white to luminous, adjusting various sections of the photo rather than simply blanketing it with a filter. The result is a camera option that genuinely makes your shots look far more interesting and lively than they otherwise would. It\u2019s an excellent enhancement to the camera app, and one you\u2019ll want to try out as soon as you get the chance.\nApple has also added a new Audio Mix editing mode for your videos that is meant to improve the voice of the person in your shot versus the ambient sound around you. There\u2019s a standard mode that leaves all of the audio levels the same, an in-frame option that focuses more on the subject in the shot and reduces the background levels, as well as studio and cinematic modes.\nIt\u2019s downright impressive how much of a difference the modes make to your video, and swapping between each while editing your piece lets you see which is better for your project. If you\u2019re in a crowded place and want to get a video of your friends and family, the in-frame mode is the choice for you. And because you adjust the audio style while editing rather than while shooting your video, you don\u2019t have to worry that you recorded it in the wrong mode and risk ruining your video when you take it.\nAll four iPhones also get new cameras. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now feature 48-megapixel ultra-wide cameras that can capture macro photography images and provide better low-light shots. Apple also says the phones offer the equivalent of a 2x optical zoom thanks to their 48-megapixel Fusion cameras.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro now comes with a 5x telephoto camera to make the 5x camera on the Pro Max, and both Pro phones get new 48-megapixel Fusion cameras and 48-megapixel ultra-wide cameras. All of that works out to some incremental changes for the iPhones' cameras. Overall, the ability to take macro photos using the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus and the addition of 5x telephoto zoom to the iPhone 16 Pro are the best upgrades of the lot.\nIn the future, Apple will also add a feature called visual intelligence to the iPhone that will allow users to point their phones' cameras at real-world objects and get information on them. One example Apple has offered is snapping a shot of a restaurant and quickly getting its hours and user reviews. But that won\u2019t land until later this year.\nIn addition to updated cameras, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max get new larger displays. The iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s screen goes from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches, while the Pro Max\u2019s goes from 6.7 to 6.9 inches. Apple did this by slightly increasing the size of the phones and slimming down their bezels, making them look more like a single piece of glass up front.\nIt\u2019s not an enormous increase in screen size, but when you\u2019re streaming movies or scrolling Reddit, any extra space is an improvement. Apple\u2019s always-on display also makes a comeback on the Pro and Pro Max, but it\u2019s still not available on the 16 or 16 Plus, which is a bummer.\nApple did, however, bring the Action Button over to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. Previously only available on the Pros, the Action Button is a customizable button on the left side of the iPhone that you can set to do things like launch the voice recorder, magnifier, or, my favorite, the flashlight.\nIn terms of power, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get Apple\u2019s new A18 chip, while the Pro and Pro Max get the A18 Pro processor. You won\u2019t run into any slowdown with either chip whether you\u2019re playing games or just browsing TikTok or Instagram, and they\u2019re both designed to run Apple Intelligence.\nAs for battery life, I got through my entire work day with the iPhone 16, then streamed the Mets game, and the battery still had a 19% charge at about 10:30 at night. As for the Pro, I used it for email and Slack, perusing social media apps, and ordering from Dunkin, and still had 71% battery life after about 7 hours of use.\nThe latest iPhones bring speedier chips, larger displays on the Pros, improved cameras, and a new camera button. If, however, you just bought an iPhone 15 or 15 Pro or even have an iPhone 14, you can still hold off.\nI can\u2019t say whether Apple Intelligence is worth upgrading to a new phone because it\u2019s not ready for prime time yet. And since it\u2019s still in beta, Apple could change or add or remove features before it releases the software.\nAll other things considered, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro are what you\u2019d expect from Apple. Great phones that are incrementally better than their predecessors. We\u2019ll have to wait until Apple Intelligence comes out to know if it pushes the phones beyond that.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Built for Apple Intelligence with the all-new A18 chip, both models feature Camera Control, powerful upgrades to the advanced camera system, the Action button to quickly access useful features, and a big boost in battery life\nCUPERTINO, Calif., September 09, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced iPhone\u00ae 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, built for Apple Intelligence\u2122, the easy-to-use personal intelligence system that understands personal context to deliver intelligence that is helpful and relevant while protecting user privacy. The iPhone 16 lineup also introduces Camera Control, which brings new ways to capture memories, and will help users quickly access visual intelligence to learn about objects or places around them faster than ever before. The powerful camera system features a 48MP Fusion camera with a 2x Telephoto option, giving users two cameras in one, while a new Ultra Wide camera enables macro photography. Next-generation Photographic Styles help users personalize their images, and spatial photo and video capture allows users to relive life\u2019s precious memories with remarkable depth on Apple Vision Pro\u2122. The new A18 chip delivers a huge leap in performance and efficiency, enabling demanding AAA games, as well as a big boost in battery life.\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will be available in five bold colors: black, white, pink, teal, and ultramarine. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 13, with availability beginning Friday, September 20.\n\"iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus mark the beginning of a new era for iPhone with Apple Intelligence delivering powerful, personal, and private experiences to our users,\" said Kaiann Drance, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. \"With new ways to discover the world around you and capture memories using Camera Control; a 48MP Fusion camera that gives you two optical-quality cameras in one; a big boost in battery life; and powerful, efficient performance thanks to the A18 chip, this is the perfect time for customers to upgrade or make the switch to iPhone.\"\nBuilt for Apple Intelligence\nApple Intelligence on the iPhone 16 lineup harnesses the power of Apple silicon and Apple-built generative models to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. Apple Intelligence maintains the privacy and security of user data with Private Cloud Compute. This groundbreaking approach provides the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers \u2014 an extraordinary step forward for privacy in artificial intelligence. Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update, with the first set of features rolling out next month in U.S. English for most regions around the world.\nApple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing. With systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages\u00ae, and third-party apps. In the Notes and Phone apps, users can also record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to recall key points.\nApple Intelligence helps users prioritize with summarized notifications, along with Priority Messages in Mail, a feature that understands the content of emails and surfaces time-sensitive messages. Across a user\u2019s inbox, summaries convey the most important information of each email instead of previewing the first few lines.\nSiri\u00ae becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience and gets a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active. With richer language-understanding capabilities, communicating with Siri is more natural and flexible. Siri follows along when users stumble over their words, and maintains context from one request to the next. Users can type to Siri at any time, and switch fluidly between text and voice as they accelerate everyday tasks. Siri also now has extensive product knowledge to answer thousands of questions about features on iPhone and other Apple devices.\nAdditional Apple Intelligence features will roll out later this year and in the months following, including Image Playground, which allows users to create playful images in moments. Emoji will be taken to an entirely new level with the ability to create original Genmoji\u2122 by simply typing a description, or by selecting a photo of a friend or family member. Siri will be able to draw on a user\u2019s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. It will also gain onscreen awareness to understand and take action with users\u2019 content, as well as take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. And while using iOS 18 features like Siri and Writing Tools, users will be able to easily access ChatGPT from OpenAI.\nA Beautiful New Design with Industry-Leading Durability\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are beautiful and built to last. iPhone holds its value longer than any other smartphone thanks to its industry-leading durability, including the strong back glass, a water- and dust-resistant design, regular software updates, and the latest-generation Ceramic Shield\u00ae with an advanced formulation that is 50 percent tougher than the first generation and 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone.1 The internal design of iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus has been reengineered to allow for an even larger battery and to better dissipate heat, while making battery service easier. With the new internal design and advanced power management of iOS 18, the batteries are optimized to offer a big boost in battery life. Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes, the Super Retina XDR\u00ae display with OLED technology and the Dynamic Island\u00ae offers an exceptional viewing experience.2\nThe Action button comes to iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, allowing users to easily access a variety of functions with just a press. Users can quickly open the camera, flashlight, or controls; switch between Ring and Silent; recognize music with Shazam\u00ae; activate Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or use Shortcuts for more options. The Action button can also access in-app functionality, like helping a user unlock and lock their car with FordPass.3\nIntroducing Camera Control\nCamera Control \u2014 a result of thoughtful hardware and software integration \u2014 elevates the camera experience on the iPhone 16 lineup. It is packed with innovation, including a tactile switch that powers the click experience, a high-precision force sensor that enables the light press gesture, and a capacitive sensor that allows for touch interactions. Camera Control can quickly launch the camera, take a photo, and start video recording so users don\u2019t miss the moment. A new camera preview helps users frame the shot and adjust other control options \u2014 such as zoom, exposure, or depth of field \u2014 to compose a stunning photo or video by sliding their finger on the Camera Control. Additionally, developers will be able to bring Camera Control to third-party apps such as Snapchat.\nLater this year, Camera Control will unlock visual intelligence to help users learn about objects and places faster than ever before. Users can click and hold Camera Control to pull up the hours or ratings for a restaurant they pass, add an event from a flyer to their calendar, quickly identify a dog by breed, and more. Camera Control will also serve as a gateway into third-party tools with specific domain expertise, like when users want to search on Google to find where they can buy an item, or to benefit from ChatGPT\u2019s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.\nNew Camera Experiences\nThe powerful new camera system helps users capture both everyday moments and cherished memories like never before. The 48MP Fusion camera enables a 2x optical-quality Telephoto option, which is like having two cameras in one, so users can get closer to the subject to easily frame a photo. In addition to wider-angle shots, the new 12MP Ultra Wide camera with autofocus enables macro photography. The Ultra Wide camera also gathers up to 2.6x more light for higher image quality. Additionally, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now take spatial photos and videos to help users relive memories with remarkable depth on Apple Vision Pro.\nNext-generation Photographic Styles help users express their creativity and customize their photos by locally adjusting color, highlights, and shadows in real time. Styles also have a deeper understanding of skin undertones, so users can personalize how they appear in photos. Unlike filters, which often use a one-size-fits-all approach by adding a color to an entire scene, adjustments are applied to specific colors of a selected style. A wider set of styles offers more creative options for editing a photo\u2019s aesthetic, and styles can be rendered during live preview, applied after a photo is taken, or even reversed later.\nVideo can now be captured in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods\u00ae, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system. Both iPhone models introduce creative new ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix \u2014 allowing users to adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.\nPowered by Apple Intelligence, users can search for specific photos in the Photos app using natural language, and search for specific moments in video clips. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo without altering the subject.\nA18: Next-Level Performance and Mobile Gaming\nA18 delivers a huge leap in performance and power efficiency, and is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology to further accelerate Apple Intelligence. An upgraded 16-core Neural Engine is optimized for large generative models and runs ML models up to 2x faster than the A16 Bionic chip.\nThe 6-core CPU is 30 percent faster than the A16 Bionic chip and faster than all the competition. It is also more power efficient and can run the same workload with 30 percent less power than A16 Bionic. The 5-core GPU is up to 40 percent faster and 35 percent more efficient than A16 Bionic to power stunning graphics performance for Apple Intelligence, and puts a powerful gaming device in users\u2019 pockets. Now with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, games on iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus more accurately represent the behavior of light with up to 5x higher frame rates than with software-based ray tracing. Both models support the AAA games previously only available on iPhone 15 Pro, as well as new titles like Honor of Kings: World with an ultra graphics mode optimized for the iPhone 16 lineup, coming next year. Game Mode in iOS 18 delivers more consistent frame rates while making AirPods, game controllers, and other wireless accessories incredibly responsive. The efficiency of A18 and the device\u2019s rearchitected internal design deliver up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming while ensuring Apple Intelligence runs efficiently on iPhone.\nExpanded Communication and Safety Capabilities\nThe iPhone 16 lineup features innovative ways to stay connected and provides enhanced safety capabilities for peace of mind. Powered by the same groundbreaking technology as Emergency SOS via satellite, users are able to connect to the nearest satellite to send and receive texts, emoji, and Tapbacks over iMessage\u00ae and SMS while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.4 Messages via satellite in iOS 18 are end-to-end encrypted. Also new with iOS 18, Emergency SOS Live Video allows users to share a live video feed or photos with participating emergency dispatchers during an emergency call.5 Later this fall, Roadside Assistance via satellite \u2014 which connects users to a roadside assistance provider if they have car trouble while off the grid \u2014 expands beyond the U.S. to the U.K.\nBetter for the Environment\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company\u2019s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is prioritizing renewable electricity in manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including the iPhone 16 lineup. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity \u2014 including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.\nTo achieve Apple 2030, the company is also designing products with recycled and renewable materials. iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus feature more than 30 percent recycled content overall, including 85 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure and 80 percent or more recycled steel across multiple components. The battery is made with 100 percent recycled cobalt and \u2014 in a first for iPhone \u2014 over 95 percent recycled lithium.6 The iPhone 16 lineup meets Apple\u2019s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury and PVC. The packaging is entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by next year.\nPricing and Availability\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will be available in ultramarine, teal, pink, white, and black in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities. iPhone 16 starts at $799 (U.S.) or $33.29 (U.S.) per month, and iPhone 16 Plus starts at $899 (U.S.) or $37.45 (U.S.) per month.\nApple offers great ways to save and upgrade to the latest iPhone.

        "Title": "Apple's iPhone 16 faces challenge from Huawei's $2,800 tri-fold phone",
        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -Apple's new iPhone 16 failed to excite investors with long-expected AI features still in test mode even as an industry-first tri-fold phone from Huawei raised the stakes in a battle to dominate the global smartphone market.\nApple's shares fell 1.7% on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. tech giant unveiled its new iPhones that sport hardware-level integration for applications based on artificial intelligence but with limited changes to the external design.\nThe phones will use AI features - dubbed Apple Intelligence - to improve the company's voice assistant Siri as well as enhance the camera.\nThose features will arrive on U.S. iPhones in beta next month, potentially keeping people from upgrading to iPhone 16s soon.\n\"With lots of words like \"later this year\" and \"early next year\", the core Apple message for iPhone 16 was: Next year will be better,\" Needham analyst Laura Martin said in a note.\nApple did not say when it would move beyond the test phase, nor did it announce a partner in China to help power its AI ambitions.\nThe lack of AI features in the new iPhones drew scorn in China, where the government has mandated that generative AI-based chatbots need to be vetted before their public release.\nThe hashtag \"iPhone 16 Chinese version doesn't support AI yet\" attracted 11.33 million views and over 1,500 comments on Weibo.\n\"What's the point of buying it if you can't use AI?\" wrote one Weibo user. Another commented, \"Without AI as the biggest selling point, it should be half price.\"\nApple did not raise prices for the new iPhones, which Wall Street analysts said was a good strategy as consumers are not willing to splurge on big-ticket items. Huawei, which showed off its new Mate XT smartphone hours after the Apple event, has priced the tri-fold device at $2,800.\n\"Production constraints and the high price point mean the new (Huawei) phone will likely not have a huge impact in terms of shipments,\" said Will Wong, senior researcher at consultancy IDC.\n\"But it's telling the consumers that it's still the tech leader and the potential challenge it brings to Apple may be far beyond just market share.\"\nCOMEBACK\nMate XT has already received more than 4 million pre-orders, for which no deposit is required, according to the company's website. It boasts an AI assistant with text summary, translation and editing functions, as well as AI-boosted image editing functions such as trimming unwanted parts of photos.\nHuawei's string of successful smartphone launches in recent months underscores the company's ability to navigate U.S. sanctions and solidifies its position against Apple in China.\nIn contrast, Apple's sales have slowed in the country after seeing strong growth for years, and its ranking in the world's second-largest economy has now dropped from third to sixth place.\nIPhone shipments in China fell by 6.7% in the second quarter of 2024, according to data from Canalys.\nHuawei made a comeback to the high-end smartphone segment last year with the release of a device powered by a domestically made chip, defying U.S. sanctions that have cut off its access to the global chipset supply chain. The launch of the Mate 60 Pro surprised analysts and U.S. officials.\nBoth the Mate XT and iPhone 16 go on sale on Sept. 20.\n($1 = 7.1199 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Casey Hall in Beijing; Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik; Writing by Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by Miyoung Kim, Sonali Paul, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Title": "Apple launches iPhone 16 with Apple Intelligence",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) debuted its iPhone 16 smartphone line during its \"Glowtime\" event at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., on Monday. The phones come in four styles: the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, and the premium iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nThe new phones are Apple's first designed specifically with its Apple Intelligence AI platform in mind and feature more powerful chips that can operate the software. The base iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now come with the same programmable Action button found on last year's iPhone 15 Pro line.\nBoth the base iPhone 16s and the iPhone 16 Pros also get new dedicated touch-sensitive camera buttons that you can click to launch the camera app. You can then click again to take a photo or click and hold to take video.\nA light press on the button brings up a new overlay that allows you to access controls like zoom. Third-party apps like Snapchat are also taking advantage of the camera button to quickly share your shots.\nOverall, the $799 iPhone 16 and $899 iPhone 16 Plus look similar to last year's models, save for the way their rear cameras are arranged. They're now stacked vertically to allow for spatial photos for use with the Apple Vision Pro headset.\nInside, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get Apple's new 3-nanometer A18 chip, which includes a 2x faster neural engine. Apple says the A18's central processing unit is up to 30% faster than the one found in the iPhone 15 line and includes a 5-core GPU, which helps run Apple Intelligence, games, and camera features. Apple says the new chip will also improve the phone's battery life.\nThe iPhone 16s will also come equipped with computational photography software to create a 2x telephoto option that simulates an optical zoom via the standard wide-angle lens. The ultra-wide lens, meanwhile, gets upgraded to 48 megapixels.\nApple further says it's bringing visual intelligence to the camera app that allows you to take a photo of something like a restaurant to get reviews of the place or take a shot of a flyer for a concert and immediately add the info to your calendar. If you see a bike in person that you'd like to buy, you can capture a photo of it and then get a quick Google link to purchase it.\nThis sounds similar to Google's existing Circle to Search feature for Android phones. I'll have to see if it works as well as Google's offering when I get my hands on it.\nThe $999 iPhone 16 Pro and $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max get larger displays this time around, with the Pro's screen jumping from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches and the Pro Max's screen increasing from 6.7 inches to 6.9 inches. The bigger displays come courtesy of thinner bezels that make the phone look more like a single sheet of glass from the front.\nBoth Pro phones come with Apple's new A18 Pro chip, offering better performance than the A18 found in the iPhone 16s. The processor's CPU is 15% faster than the A17 Pro and uses 20% less power.\nThe Pro and Pro Max also get more powerful 48-megapixel fusion cameras and 48-megapixel ultra-wide cameras. The Pro gets a new 5x optical zoom to match the Pro Max's capabilities. The iPhone 15 Pro only offered 3x zoom.\nLike the iPhone 16s, the Pros get the same camera controls via the new dedicated camera button, and later this year Apple will add a two-step shutter that locks onto a subject via a software update. You'll also now be able to shoot video in 4K 120 frames per second for slick slo-mo videos. You can also adjust frames per second after you shoot your videos via the Photos app.\nOn the audio side of things, the Pros get four built-in microphones and spatial audio recording. An Audio Mix feature lets you determine how you want audio to sound in the videos to shoot professional-sounding movies.\nTo illustrate the iPhone 16 Pro's video chops, the company showed off how the features were used to shoot The Weeknd's latest music video.\nAs for Apple Intelligence, Apple says the software will be available as a free software update, with the first features coming as a beta in the US next month. Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish language versions of Apple Intelligence will be available next year.\nApple didn't announce any new features for Apple Intelligence, but did spend time reminding consumers of the capabilities it announced during its WWDC event in June.\nThe company touched on its Private Cloud Compute, which runs server-based AI features without saving any of your data. Apple says its AI-driven writing tools will be deeply integrated into iOS, ranging from first-party apps like Mail to third-party programs like Slack and Goodreads. The company further says Apple Intelligence will allow you to easily search for specific photos and moments in videos.\nSummarization tools will be available across iOS including for texts, work messages, and email. Mail also gets priority emails that alert you to what Apple Intelligence believes are your most important messages.\nSiri is also getting an upgrade, making it easier to chat with the voice assistant or type to ask it questions. Apple says Siri will get even more powerful upgrades in the future.\nBut the fact that Apple Intelligence isn't launching out of the gate with the new iPhones could be a problem for Apple. Wall Street is banking on the feature to drive a new iPhone sales cycle. Any delay in Apple Intelligence's release could put a damper on those hopes.\nApple's iPhone is its most important product and serves as a jumping-off point for customers to engage further with Apple's vast ecosystem of products and services ranging from its AirPods to Apple TV+.\nBut iPhone sales have been flagging as of late. The company posted $39.2 billion in iPhone revenue its third quarter versus $39.6 billion during the same period last year. Part of that has to do with the company's performance in the Greater China region, which saw a roughly $1 billion year-over-year decline in revenue in its latest quarter.\nThat said, the iPhone is still Apple's biggest moneymaker. In 2023, the smartphone made up $200.5 billion of the company's $383.2 billion in overall revenue.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Max A. Cherney, Kenrick  Cai ",
        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney, Kenrick Cai\nCUPERTINO, California (Reuters) -Apple on Monday unveiled its long-awaited, artificial intelligence-boosted iPhone 16 and promised improvements in its Siri personal assistant as it rolled out new software, beginning in test mode next month.\n\"The next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up. It marks the beginning of an exciting new era,\" Chief Executive Tim Cook said at a product launch.\nShares of Apple closed barely changed for the day at $220.91. Apple's event came hours before China's Huawei launches a tri-fold phone, underscoring the competitive challenge the iPhone maker faces. Apple has yet to announce an AI partner in China to power the 16s.\nApple and technology companies around the world are racing to add AI to products, and phones are expected to be among the most important battlegrounds. The Cupertino, California-based company also is betting the AI feature will drive consumers to upgrade amid a slowdown in iPhone sales.\nApple Intelligence, the company's AI software, will be used to improve Siri as well as enhancing features such as understanding and identifying objects captured by the phone camera, executives said.\nA test version of Apple Intelligence will be available in the U.S. version of the English language next month. It will be available for other localized versions of English in December, with versions in languages including Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish next year. Features including improvements to Siri will be rolled out over time, Apple said. It did not say, however, when it would move beyond test.\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will cost the same as models they replace and use a new chip and an aluminum case. A customizable button that can control the camera was one of the most touted hardware features in a format that looks similar to previous models.\nThe higher-end 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max are made from titanium and have more AI capability, such as offering suggestions on how to set up a photo shoot more effectively and audio-editing capabilities aimed at professional-level video production.\nApple's new iPhone chips use the latest version of Arm's architecture that includes specific features to speed AI applications.\n\"Existing iPhone users who have had their device for 3-4 years will definitely be enticed to upgrade, even if some things are rolling out later, as this will future-proof their device for AI,\" said International Data Corp analyst Nabila Popal.\nStill, several analysts described the delays in features as keeping many potential buyers on the sidelines initially.\n\"You might see people wait a little bit to see how these things work out, how well they function, and then they'll start to investigate it. But I don't think we'll see the mad rush that we've seen in years past,\" said TECHnalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell.\nBy comparison, Huawei's website showed on Monday that it had garnered more than 3 million pre-orders for its Z-shaped tri-fold phone ahead of its official unveiling. This underscores Huawei's ability to navigate U.S. sanctions and solidifies its position against Apple in China, where consumers are hankering for more AI features and are willing to pay for them.\nWATCHES AND AIRPODS\nApple also unveiled new Watches and AirPods with health-focused capabilities, as well as hardware-design improvements. Apple highlighted the Watch's ability to discover longer-term health conditions such as sleep apnea as well as detecting and responding to emergencies such as a fall.\nAs it updated AirPods, Apple rolled out hearing-aid features that it has submitted for U.S. regulatory review.\nApple fans globally have been waiting to see the new phones with AI. IPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's $383 billion sales last year.\n\"While Android phones may have some of these features, Apple has packaged them well and will be able to market them far more broadly,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\nChina offers particular challenges to Apple.\n\"Apple fell out of the list of top five smartphone vendors in China in Q2,\" said eMarketer senior technology analyst Gadjo Sevilla. \"It was the first time that China's domestic smartphone firms held all five spots. Since Apple Intelligence still needs to be approved by Beijing for a rollout in China, it will likely not initially be a key driver for adoption in the region.\"\nIn China, Apple aggressively slashed prices earlier this year, prompted by government restrictions and increased domestic competition.\nThe iPhone 16 lineup is the first Apple smartphones designed around these AI features though those are expected also to be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the top-end versions of the previous-generation devices.\nRivals including Alphabet's Google are also showcasing AI features to try to upend Apple's dominance in the high-end smartphone market.\nGoogle, developer of the Android operating system which competes with Apple's iOS, focused its Pixel smartphone rollout event in August on AI features including Gemini Live, which allows users to hold live voice conversations with a digital assistant. Many of the AI features Google announced were also rolled out to the Android-based devices made by manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola.\nIn June, one week after its developer conference, Apple said it would delay the release of AI-powered features in Europe due to European Union tech rules.\nHuawei has scheduled an official announcement of its Mate XT Z-fold phone on Tuesday in China.\n(Reporting by Max Cherney in Cupertino, California, and Kenrick Cai in San Francisco; additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik, Arsheeya Bajwa, Aatrayee Chatterjee, L Unnamalai and Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Michael Grothaus ",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s iOS 18 is packed with new features for the iPhone including new ways to customize your home screen layout, a revamped Control Center, and numerous productivity features. But iOS 18 also includes several privacy and security enhancements to help keep your data more secure. Here\u2019s how to use them.\nMost Read from Fast Company\n8 great free sites for finding remote jobs\nThese are the most expensive housing markets in America, according to Zillow data\n10 signs you\u2019re not fit to lead people\nApple is introducing a completely new app in iOS 18 called Passwords. As its name suggests, Passwords is a dedicated password manager, and it allows iPhone owners to organize and control their passwords like never before.\nThe best thing about the Passwords app is that the user doesn\u2019t have to do anything to set it up. You\u2019ll find all the passwords that were once stored in your iCloud Keychain already imported into the app. From there, Passwords provides several categories that allow users to access the password or login info they are looking for quickly, including:\nAll: This category shows you all your saved passwords. Tap on any password to see all the details about it.\nPasskeys: This category shows you all the passkeys saved to your account. Passkeys are password replacements and allow you to log into a site using your biometrics.\nCodes: This category will show you all the accounts for which you have multifactor authentication codes (known as MFA or 2FA) set up. If you are logging into a website and it asks for your authentication code, just go to this section of the Passwords app to quickly look it up.\nWi-Fi: This category contains all the passwords for the various Wi-Fi networks you have joined.\nSecurity: This category shows you if any of your passwords are weak or have been compromised.\nDeleted: This category contains passwords you have deleted.\nAnother huge benefit of the Passwords app is that it allows you to share your passwords with others by creating shared groups. This is great for families where every member might want login information to a particular streaming service, for example. Passwords now make it easy to share this info.\nIn iOS 18, Apple is finally giving users the ability to lock any app behind Face ID or Touch ID. This means that before the app is allowed to be launched, the person will be asked to verify themselves via their face or fingerprint. Previously, apps could only be locked behind Face ID or Touch ID if developers added the security feature themselves.\nBut why might you want to secure an app behind Face ID or Touch ID? The most obvious use case is if you let someone use your iPhone to make a phone call. If you\u2019ve locked other apps behind Face ID this means the person using your phone can\u2019t snoop around to see what\u2019s saved in your your Notes or Photos app, for example.\nTo lock an app behind Face ID or Touch ID, do the following:\nLong press on the app\u2019s icon.\nTap \u201cRequire Face ID\u201d from the contextual menu (it will say \u201cRequire Touch ID\u201d if you have an iPhone with Touch ID).\nOn the popup that appears, tap \u201cRequire Face/Touch ID.\u201d\nThe next time you attempt to launch the app (or someone else does), it will not open until you\u2019ve authenticated with your biometrics.\nApple is also adding the ability to hide apps that are installed on your iPhone. When an app is hidden, it will not show on any of the iPhone\u2019s home screens. Anyone with access to your phone won\u2019t be able to see that you have the app installed\u2014giving you a greater level of privacy.\nThere are myriad reasons why you might want to hide certain apps. For example, you may want to hide apps that contain personal details about your health, or ones where you write down your daily thoughts. Whatever the reason for hiding an app, Apple makes it easy to do so:\nLong press on the app\u2019s icon.\nTap \u201cRequire Face ID\u201d from the contextual menu (it will say \u201cRequire Touch ID\u201d if you have an iPhone with Touch ID).\nOn the popup that appears, tap \u201cHide and Require Face/Touch ID.\u201d\nIn the next popup, tap \u201cHide App.\u201d\nThe app will now vanish from your home screen. However, you can still access it. You do this by swiping to your App Libary. Tap on the \u201cHidden\u201d folder and then authenticate with your biometrics. All your hidden apps will appear, and you can use them as normal.\nApps may occasionally ask for access to the contacts on your iPhone for various reasons. For example, social media apps can use your contact information to help you find friends. But your contacts also allow companies to build up a social graph around you, which can reveal all kinds of personal details, like who your doctors are.\nBefore iOS 18, you had to give an app access to all your contacts\u2014or none. Now, in iOS 18, there is a middle ground: You can give an app access to only the contacts of your choosing. This allows you to let a messenger app, for example, know who your friends are, but not see the names of any doctors you have saved in your address book.\nIn iOS 18, when an app asks for Contacts access for the first time, you\u2019ll be asked if you want to deny access, allow full access, or select access to contacts of your choosing. But you can also change the type of access you have granted to existing apps in the past. Here\u2019s how:\nOpen the Settings app.\nTap on Privacy & Security.\nTap Contacts.\nYou\u2019ll now see a list of apps that have requested Contacts access. Tap on the app whose access you want to change.\nOn the next screen, choose None, Limited Access, or Full Access.\nIf you choose \u201cLimited Access\u201d a screen will appear asking you to select the specific contacts you want the app to have access to. Tap the name of the contact so a blue checkmark appears next to it.\nTap Done when finished selecting contacts.\nThe app will now have access only to the contacts you have granted it access to.\niOS 18 is now available as a free download. It requires an iPhone XR or later or an iPhone SE (2nd generation) or later.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies \u2014 especially generative AI \u2014 has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company launched the latest model of the iPhone, dubbed iPhone 16, earlier this month. The new phone debuted with a lot of hype around Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) believes will change the way consumers interact with phones altogether. Initial demand figures for the phone paint a confusing picture, but Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has dismissed concerns around slower growth projections, reiterating in a recent investor note that with the introduction of artificial intelligence, a number of camera upgrades and better battery life as part of the iPhone 16, it was possible the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle topped 90 million units on initial launch. Ives further claimed that the launch of the iPhone 16 was the start of an AI driven supercycle, and throughout fiscal 2025, Apple could sell more than 240 million units of the phone.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., fresh off the release of the iPhone 16, is preparing to announce a new low-end phone early next year alongside upgraded iPads.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSingapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World\u2019s Most Unequal Nation\nFrom Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\nWhat Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars?\nFor a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\nThe company is nearing production of an updated iPhone SE \u2014 codenamed V59 \u2014 that will become its new entry-level model, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apple is also aiming to manufacture new iPad Air models and keyboards for release around the same time, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren\u2019t public.\nThe release will mark the first update to the iPhone SE since 2022, when Apple added 5G capability to the device. With the latest model, Apple will move away from the old home button design and transition to an edge-to-edge screen.\nThe SE overhaul will help Apple compete in the low-end smartphone market, where it faces tough competition from Android devices \u2014 especially in China. The current model costs $429, which is hundreds less than the standard iPhone but more expensive than many of its rivals. Modernizing the SE so it looks more like its higher-end siblings should help entice budget-minded shoppers and potentially win back market share lost to brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi.\nThe new SE phone is expected to support Apple Intelligence, an upcoming suite of AI tools that will also work with the iPhone 16 and the high-end versions of last year\u2019s iPhone 15. The new model will resemble the iPhone 14, including the notch cutout at the top. The current SE more closely resembles the iPhone 8, the last standard version to include a home button.\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\nThe new iPad Air models \u2014 codenamed J607 and J637 \u2014 will focus on internal improvements. Apple also is preparing an updated version of its Magic Keyboard accessory, codenamed R307 and R308, for both the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the new Air. These will bring some of the features of the iPad Pro keyboard down-market.\nEarlier this year, Apple updated the Air lineup with an M2 chip and added the 13-inch screen option. A new iPad mini \u2014 codenamed J410 \u2014 is coming too, potentially by the end of 2024.\nA revamped version of the iPad Pro was released at the same time as this year\u2019s iPad Air, but that higher-end device includes an M4 processor that has yet to come to other models. That means an update is less urgent given the chip is already a generation ahead.\nBeyond the new iPhone SE and iPads, Apple is also refreshing its Mac computer lineup. Updated models this year will include a revamped Mac mini as well as updated MacBook Pros and iMacs. They\u2019ll sport the M4 processor and highlight Apple Intelligence features. The M4 chip will come to the MacBook Air, Mac Studio and Mac Pro during 2025.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s most important event of the year takes place Monday, when the company will roll out its latest iPhones and set the stage for a new artificial intelligence platform.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis\nAfter a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates\nChicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025\nUC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus\nThe event kicks off from Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. local time. Apple doesn\u2019t typically hold this event on a Monday, but the earlier timing lets the company get out ahead of an eventful Tuesday: There\u2019s a US presidential debate that day, and the European Commission is slated to announce a decision on whether Apple has to pay $14 billion in taxes stemming from a longstanding agreement with Ireland.\nThe most significant product announcement will be the iPhone 16 line, but the company is also preparing major updates to both the Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Intelligence \u2014 a new suite of AI tools that includes an updated Siri digital assistant \u2014 also will feature prominently. The theme of the event, \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime,\u201d is a reference to Siri\u2019s new interface.\nThe stakes are high for Apple, which looks to prove to both consumers and Wall Street that it\u2019s now a major player in generative artificial intelligence. But the company\u2019s AI technology is still a work in progress. Apple Intelligence has faced numerous delays, and many key features won\u2019t arrive until next year. For now, the technology is focused on summarizing messages and notifications, rather than matching the dazzling interactivity of rival systems.\nEven so, Monday\u2019s updates will breathe new life into products that sit at the heart of the Apple device lineup and generate roughly 60% of the company\u2019s annual revenue. They also drive consumer spending on services, an increasingly vital source of sales. Apple\u2019s finances could use the boost. The company has only just begun to emerge from its longest sales slump in decades.\nHere\u2019s everything that\u2019s expected to be announced at Monday\u2019s presentation:\niPhone\nIn line with the past several years, Apple will introduce four new iPhone models: the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nLike in 2023, the changes to the non-Pro iPhones will be minor. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will look like last year\u2019s versions, including 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen sizes and aluminum cases. They\u2019ll gain faster processors and include a total of 8 gigabytes of memory (up from 6). That memory will help support Apple Intelligence and other features.\nThose lower-end phones will get the same Action button currently featured on the Pro models, as well as vertically stacked rear cameras that support spatial video recording \u2014 the 3D clips that can be viewed with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headsets.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, meanwhile, will retain the iPhone 15 Pro line design save for one noticeable change: the displays. The screen sizes are increasing to 6.3 inches on the smaller model (up from from 6.1 inches) and going to 6.9 inches from 6.7 inches on the Max version. While the changes represent an increase of less than 5% on both models, the shift will come with bezels that are now about a third slimmer. That should make for a sleeker overall look.\nLike the iPhone 15 Pro line, the 16 Pro models will support Apple Intelligence with the inclusion of 8 gigabytes of memory. They\u2019ll also get speedier chips with an enhanced neural engine that Apple will say is optimized for AI.\nBoth of the iPhone 16 Pro models will get camera upgrades as well, including a move to a 48-megapixel lens from a 12-megapixel one for the ultrawide-angle camera. That will match the megapixels of the standard, wide-angle camera on last year\u2019s model. The smaller iPhone 16 Pro will also gain 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, up from 3x, to match the Max version.\nThe most significant camera enhancement coming to both models: a dedicated, touch-sensitive button on the right side of the phone for taking photos and video. This button will be the biggest selling point for the new iPhones, other than AI. It will work similarly to a shutter button on a DSLR camera, allowing a user to lightly press it to focus on a subject and then press harder to take a picture. It will also be capacitive, allowing a user to swipe across it to move between still and video modes and zoom in and out.\nWhile the phones will all look mostly the same as last year, Apple is shaking up its color palette. The Pro models will now come in a gold titanium to replace blue titanium, while the black, white and natural options will still be available. The non-Pro versions will trade in yellow for white and get new shades of green, pink and blue.\nAirPods\nApple is preparing two new AirPods models to replace the entry-level, second-generation earbuds and mid-tier, third-generation model. Both new versions will look similar to the AirPods Pro and include a new case, USB-C charging and improved audio quality.\nApple will distinguish the two models by giving the new mid-tier version a higher-end case with a speaker \u2014 making it easier to locate with Apple\u2019s Find My feature \u2014 as well as noise cancellation to match the AirPods Pro.\nA few weeks ago, Apple discovered a bug in the upcoming AirPods that made the earbuds quickly drain battery life. This issue was determined to be software-related and resolved prior to factories shipping out the products.\nOne major new feature is a bigger push into hearing health. Apple has been working to turn the AirPods into a replacement for hearing aids as well as a device for conducting hearing tests. The company is preparing to announce the enhancements \u2014 codenamed Yodel \u2014 but they\u2019ve suffered some delays and may not be available until later.\nA new version of the AirPods Pro remains in the works, including an upgraded design and improved noise cancellation. It\u2019s due as early as next year.\nAnd Apple has been working on updated AirPods Max headphones that will come in new colors and switch the Lightning connector to USB-C to comply with the latest laws from the European Union. But there\u2019s still plenty of current AirPods Max inventory on hand, suggesting that the update could be coming later.\nApple Watch\nFor the first time in two years, the company is preparing to update all of its Apple Watch models at once. There will be a new low-end Apple Watch SE, a mid-level Series 10 model and an Ultra 3.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra will only get minor tweaks, focusing on internal upgrades rather than outside changes.\nThe biggest upgrade to the Apple Watch line will be with the Series 10 model, which marks the decade anniversary of the product\u2019s introduction in 2014. For the first time since the Series 7, the flagship Apple Watch model will get an updated look.\nThe overall design will be similar to the Apple Watch Series 9, but the company will now offer slightly larger screen-size options and the watch case itself will be noticeably thinner.\nThough new AI features are coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac, don\u2019t expect the watches to get major Apple Intelligence capabilities. Any AI technology will probably be tied specifically to a future health coach service.\nAt the start of the year, Apple was forced to remove blood-oxygen sensing from new watches due to a lawsuit with Masimo Corp. over patents. There\u2019s been no evidence that the feature is returning in time for the latest models, and that may affect whether users want to upgrade their existing watches to versions that won\u2019t have the function.\nA major new health feature is coming, though: sleep apnea detection, which will build on the existing sleep tracking. This feature will attempt to determine if a wearer has sleep apnea and then suggest further testing with a medical professional. While Apple has been preparing to announce it, the enhancement may not be available on day one of the new model going on sale.\nOn the other hand, while Apple aimed to bring hypertension \u2014 or high blood pressure \u2014 detection to the Apple Watch this year, signs point to that feature being delayed and no longer in the cards for an immediate release.\nOther Products\nApple is working on transitioning its entire Mac line to M4 chips, starting with the MacBook Pro, Mac mini and iMac. But any Mac upgrades are likely to come at a follow-up launch \u2014 no earlier than October \u2014 rather than at the September event.\nWhile the company has been working on an update to the Apple TV set-top box for as early as this year, no new model has come to fruition and stable inventory of the device suggests a new version isn\u2019t on the immediate horizon.\nA new iPhone SE with an OLED display, edge-to-edge screen and no home button is in advanced testing, but a release isn\u2019t planned until next year. A fresh AirTag is also in development, though Apple isn\u2019t planning a release until next year either.\nThere are also new iPads in the works, including an upgraded mini version. They\u2019re on deck for Apple\u2019s October event alongside the M4 Macs.\nSign up for the Power On newsletter to get the inside scoop from Mark Gurman on all things Apple and consumer tech.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\nThe Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following\nLearning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot\n\u2018They Have Stolen Our Business\u2019: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design\u200b. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets \u2013 over 20% \u2013 to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Just a few weeks after launching the new iPhone with Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features heavily marketed by the tech giant, a new Apple event is likely to take place in October that would unveil the newest versions of the MacBook Pro, iMac, and the Mac Mini. The new computers would also come pre-loaded with Apple Intelligence and are expected to rival AI workloads of PCs announced by Apple rival Microsoft in the last few months. Apple had debuted Apple Intelligence back in June, the first step of the tech giant into the world of generative AI.\nMorgan Stanley recently reiterated an Overweight rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a $273 price target. In an investor note, the advisory noted that Apple iPhone 16 lead times were improving but were still tracking lower year-over-year. However, lead times as a proxy for demand this early had little predictive power, contended the analysts at Morgan Stanley, who argued that the trajectory of lead times in the next 10 days was more important. First two-week lead times were directionally predictive of next 12 month shipments at the model level, but not for December quarter iPhone build revisions or total iPhone shipments, added the analysts.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

The model helps the company to better compete with industry leaders Samsung, Xiaomi and others in the mid-range smartphone market.\nApple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nThe iPhone SE is generally considered the cheapest model from the iPhone series with prices starting from $429.\nThe new iPad Air models \u2014 codenamed J607 and J637 \u2014 will focus on internal improvements, the report said, adding that the company is also preparing an updated version of its Magic Keyboard accessory, codenamed R307 and R308, for both the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the new Air.\nThe new SE phone is expected to support the company's AI software, Apple Intelligence, the report added.\nEarly in September, Apple unveiled its long-awaited AI powered iPhone 16 models which promised improvements in its Siri personal assistant as well as enhancing features such as understanding and identifying objects captured by the phone camera.\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters on Monday, Sept. 9. The company is widely expected to debut four new iPhones, along with the tenth-anniversary edition of the Apple Watch and new AirPods.\nIn addition to hardware, the showcase will focus heavily on the rollout of Apple\u2019s Apple Intelligence AI platform for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The company\u2019s fall event is easily one of its most important of the year and helps set the tone for Apple\u2019s year ahead, and I'll be on the ground in Cupertino bringing you all of the latest news.\nHere\u2019s what to expect from Apple\u2019s \u201cGlowtime\u201d show.\nApple Intelligence will bring a host of new capabilities to Apple\u2019s product lines, including summarizing long text message threads, prioritizing and summarizing emails, and a much-needed upgrade for Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will release Apple Intelligence as part of a software update in October, rather than alongside the company\u2019s latest iPhones, to give developers more time to test out and build apps for the platform. Other Apple Intelligence features may not land on users\u2019 iPhones until early 2025.\nThe hope for the Glowtime event is that Apple will provide an update on when the software will be available and dig into any additional capabilities it has to offer.\nApple Intelligence could be one of the most consequential launches for Apple in years. The software will only run on the iPhone 15 Pro and newer models, giving investors hope that it will spur a new iPhone sales cycle. And with people holding onto their phones longer, Wall Street will welcome any means of getting users to upgrade sooner than later with open arms.\nApple\u2019s next-generation iPhone, likely called the iPhone 16, will reportedly get relatively modest hardware upgrades. If Apple follows the same strategy it has during previous releases, the base iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will get the A17 Pro chip found in last year's iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max phones, while the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will get new, more powerful processors.\nThere's also the possibility that Apple will bring new chips to all four iPhone models. According to a report by MacRumors, citing Haitong International Securities\u2019 analyst Jeff Pu, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will get an improved A18 processor, while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will get the company's A18 Pro.\nThe A18 chip has been developed using SoftBank-owned Arm's (ARM) latest newest V9 chip design to underpin AI features, the Financial Times newspaper reported on Saturday.\nMacRumors also said the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lines will get new capacitive \u201cCapture\u201d buttons that could be used as physical camera buttons to, well, capture photos. The button will live on the right side of the phones below the volume buttons. Non-Pro iPhone 16 models will also get the programmable Action button previously only available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will also get larger displays, jumping from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches for the Pro and 6.7 to 6.9 inches for the Pro Max without increasing the phones\u2019 sizes thanks to slimmer bezels, reported Gurman.\nThe new iPhones are also expected to bring feature camera improvements, including enhanced optical zoom capabilities on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nDon\u2019t expect too much more from the iPhone 16 line, though. Apple is more focused on making Apple Intelligence a success than making major changes to the iPhone's hardware. Next year\u2019s models, however, could get a far thinner design, creating something akin to an iPhone Air, according to Gurman.\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the debut of the first Apple Watch, and according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will mark the occasion by giving the watch a fresh makeover.\nThe 41-millimeter version of the Apple Watch will reportedly get a new 45-mm display, while the existing 45-mm option will get a larger 49-mm screen. According to Gurman, Apple was looking to add blood pressure and sleep apnea detection features to the new watches but won't be able to this year due to a mixture of technical issues and Apple's ongoing legal battle over its blood oxygen sensor.\nApple will also debut an updated version of the Apple Watch Ultra, though it will largely remain the same outside of a new chip.\nFinally, be on the lookout for upgraded versions of Apple\u2019s entry-level and mid-range AirPods, Gurman reported. The earbuds will get updated designs and features, including active noise cancellation for the mid-range version while costing the same as the current models: $129 for the base versions and $169 for the mid-range versions. Don\u2019t expect interchangeable silicon tips like those found on the AirPods Pro, though. Those will continue to be exclusive to the company\u2019s pricier models.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the \u201cwedge\u201d in the market.\n\u201cThe biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That\u2019s beginning to go away. It\u2019s almost to the fact that no one\u2019s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that\u2019s worrisome.\u201d\nHyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China \u201cjoining the party\u201d will be two key tailwinds for the market.\nAnswering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.\n\u201cWe have a lot of components of a soft landing. I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,\u201d Hyzy added.\nFor this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nMore and more Wall Street analysts are starting to realize that the much-hyped demand for iPhone 16 might never be realized and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in a different world now.\nLead times for the iPhone 16 are shorter than in recent years, according to investment firms. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Erik Woodring points out that while supply has improved and there are some signs of strong demand, it\u2019s wise to remain cautious. As of September 24, average lead times in the U.S. for the iPhone 16 stand at 15.2 days, down from 25.7 days for the iPhone 15 last year and 18 days for the iPhone 14 in 2022.\nGlobally, the trend is similar, with average lead times for the iPhone 16 at 16.3 days, compared to 28.5 days for the iPhone 15. UBS analysts echo these findings, noting that typically, wait times for high-end models like the Pro and Pro Max increase as demand stabilizes. However, this year, wait times for the iPhone 16 haven\u2019t shown the same uptick as in previous launches.\nUBS suspects demand might stay below expectations until the rollout of iOS 18.2 in November, which will introduce more AI features. The update, iOS 18.1, is set for mid-October and will showcase some of these features. While it\u2019s early to draw firm conclusions from lead times, Woodring suggests the outlook for iPhone builds leans more negative than positive, despite reports of strong initial demand from some regions like India.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\nHowever, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) gained but detracted from relative performance due to our underweight. While the company\u2019s overall and iPhone revenues declined year over year, the unveiling of an upgraded iPad Pro and iPad Air boosted investor sentiment. In particular, the introduction of generative AI features allayed concerns that Apple was not keeping pace with competitors.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Quote\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.Apple Intelligence will be first available in U.S. English and will be expanded quickly to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.K. in December. Additional language support \u2013 Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish will be available next year.Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, becomes more natural, contextually aware and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests.\u00a0The new writing tool helps users rewrite, proofread, and summarize text everywhere, including mail, notes, pages and third-party apps.\u00a0Photo features get enhancement as the Movie feature now allows users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description. The new Clean Up tool identifies and removes distracting objects in the background of a photo without altering the subject.Apple has integrated ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space with Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.Although Apple\u2019s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged its strong growth driver. In the fiscal third quarter, Services revenues grew 14.1% year over year to $24.21 billion and accounted for 28.2% of sales.Apple expects the September-end quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as the June-end quarter on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\nThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nApple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 29.43X compared with the sector\u2019s 24.76X and higher than the median of 27.68X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple shares have returned 23.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s appreciation of 23.9%.\n\u00a0\nApple\u2019s AI push is attractive for growth-oriented investors.

        "Text": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 line hits store shelves on Sept. 20, and while the new phones get some impressive hardware upgrades, their biggest selling point isn\u2019t the Pros' larger displays or the lineup\u2019s Camera Control button. It\u2019s the generative AI-powered Apple Intelligence software platform.\nAnd while Apple Intelligence won\u2019t launch alongside the new phones \u2014 it\u2019ll begin to roll out as a software update for US English users in October \u2014 it\u2019s clear that Apple (AAPL) is throwing all of its weight behind the technology as the catalyst to reaccelerate iPhone sales, which have flagged in recent quarters.\nApple CEO Tim Cook pointed to the iPhone 16 lineup as the first built \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d for Apple Intelligence. Wall Street is similarly banking on Apple Intelligence pushing users to upgrade from their older iPhones, with analysts including Morgan Stanley\u2019s Erik Woodring and Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives saying the platform is key to future iPhone growth.\nWhile the iPhone 16 may benefit from the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, the company is clearly positioning the platform as its software of the future, something it will build on for years to come.\n\u201cThis is a long-term play for Apple,\u201d Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, wrote in a note following Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 launch event on Sept. 9. \u201cAnd while we may not see the bigger impact immediately, Apple Intelligence will eventually change the smartphone user experience completely, like with the first iPhone.\u201d\nDuring the show\u2019s keynote, Apple hit on a number of Apple Intelligence features it says will be coming to iPhones next month. Those include product updates the company showed off during its WWDC event in June, such as generative AI-powered summarizations for text notifications and emails; writing tools to help proofread, punch up, and summarize documents; photo editing tools; and the ability to record and transcribe notes and phone calls.\nIt\u2019s an early look at how Apple is thinking of AI and where it thinks it will benefit consumers the most. We\u2019ve seen similar capabilities from Google and Samsung, but Apple was sure to point out that its first crop of AI offerings is just the beginning of a larger rollout, which will include a reimagined, more capable version of Siri.\nThe goal is to ensure consumers don\u2019t get their hands on the first few AI apps and shrug their shoulders at their limited functionality. After all, the tech industry has promised that generative AI will revolutionize virtually every gadget and piece of software. And if consumers\u2019 first experiences with the technology underwhelm, it could sour their view on Apple\u2019s AI plans.\nAfter all, remember what happened when Apple released its Apple Maps app in 2012 before it was ready for primetime? Users derided its look, and it took years for the software to gain traction.\nPositioning Apple Intelligence\u2019s initial set of features as the first in a series of software updates for iPhone owners gives Apple the latitude to deliver portions of its AI platform piecemeal, ensuring that even if users are put off by early interactions with the software, the company will be able to correct those issues and have more capabilities to market in the future.\nLaunching new features in the future would also give Apple cover if any of the first batch of Apple Intelligence offerings run into hiccups like the kind Google experienced when it rolled out AI Overviews and had to pull it back after it told people to add glue to their pizza.\nOutside of that, slowly launching Apple Intelligence products should keep users from feeling overwhelmed with so many new features at once, which could similarly confuse and turn them off from the experience.\nWhile launching Apple Intelligence over time will help Apple better control its rollout, the company still has to deliver on its already lofty expectations. And while it may not blow people away at the start, the company is setting up Apple Intelligence to be quite an impressive collection of features.\nSiri, in particular, looks like it will finally become the smart assistant we were promised years ago, complete with the ability to understand what\u2019s on your screen and the option to not only speak your requests but type them out as well.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Siri is a new interface that will change how we interact with the world around us \u2014 yet,\u201d Forrester vice president and principal analyst Thomas Husson said in a statement. \u201cHowever, there are clear signs that Siri is finally moving into becoming more of a digital agent leveraging on-device information and personal context to deliver new multimodal experiences and take actions on the user\u2019s behalf.\"\nApple also showed off its new visual intelligence feature, which it says will use the iPhone 16\u2019s new Camera Control functionality to provide information about the world around you similar to Google\u2019s Circle to Search. Point your camera at a restaurant using visual intelligence, and it will pull up ratings and hours; see a pair of shoes you like and point your camera at them to find purchasing options online.\nWhile Apple is playing it safe on its rollout strategy, it\u2019s clear it has bigger ideas in the hopper that could dramatically alter the way we use our phones. The company just has to deliver on those plans.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "When longtime tech sector analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush speaks, investors tend to listen. He's one of the more prominent voices in stock punditry, and more than a few of his calls have proved to be accurate.\nSo the market noticed when Ives waxed bullish on the next phase of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) development, which he believes will be an upgrade \"supercycle\" starting with the just-introduced iPhone 16. The analyst feels that masses of people currently using older iPhone models will be eager to switch to the 16, mostly because of one feature that should produce a surge in demand.\nThat feature is Apple Intelligence, which, as the name strongly implies, is the tech giant's artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Apple Intelligence is to be packed into all iPhones starting with the 16. So far it's been something of a rare bird, with access limited to the high-end iPhone 15 Pro series.\nIves wrote, in a research note on the company, that users of old iPhones won't be able to resist the lure of AI. Brisk sales of AI-stuffed iPhone 16s should result and, as a consequence, developers will create hundreds of AI-powered apps for Apple's iOS. This will make the company an important driver, or the important driver, of AI development in the vast consumer sphere. In turn, this should significantly boost Apple's fundamentals and crank up demand for its stock.\n\"We believe [Wall] Street is starting to slowly recognize that with Apple Intelligence on the doorstep in essence Cupertino will be the gatekeepers of the consumer AI revolution,\" the analyst wrote in late August, just before the iPhone 16's introduction.\nAccording to Ives's research, around 300 million iPhone users have not upgraded their hardware in more than four years (all told, there are 1.5 billion iPhones in this world, according to his estimates, forming the bulk of the 2.2 billion Apple devices in total). Assuming his prediction comes true, the company could indeed see sudden, skyrocketing demand from folks wanting the 16. He put a dollar figure on this, forecasting that Apple stands to reap $30 to $40 per share in monetization opportunities from AI alone.\nLike a host of tech companies, incumbent and upstart alike, Apple is pushing hard to be a first-mover in mass-market AI. For all its size, reach, and power, though, pole position is by no means guaranteed. To cite but one example, Apple's peer/rival Microsoft has developed and deployed Copilot, a suite of AI tools that is being integrated into a wide range of that company's software and services.\nLike the iPhone 16 with Apple Intelligence, Microsoft is baking a version of Copilot into hardware too. In May it introduced a new series of Windows PCs that will have its Copilot+ pre-installed. The AI revolution might end up being spearheaded not by iPhones and iPads but by desk jockeys using Windows PCs -- which are so common in homes and workplaces as to be nearly ubiquitous.\nSo while Ives's enthusiasm is understandable given Apple's big AI lunge, at this point no one should be ready to award the company the gold medal. Generative AI takes some time to get the hang of, and to master, so I don't envision it being a sudden killer app. I also don't get the sense that most consumers are frothing at the mouth to have an AI phone. The tech is still relatively new, and even if many are aware of its potential, they might not find it sufficiently useful and applicable to their lives (at least, not yet).\nThat being said, AI will certainly be a draw to a segment of the iPhone user base and, to some degree, help attract new users. I think this demand is more likely to play out as an initial slow burn before advancing in a long-term rise; ditto for AI's impact on Apple's results and the popularity of its stock. So as a current Apple shareholder I'm encouraged by what AI might be able to do for its future. I'm just not ready to get overly excited about it at this early stage.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone launch event on Monday, Sept. 9, at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.\nCEO Tim Cook is expected to headline the keynote, which will reportedly include the debut of the iPhone 16 lineup, the 10th anniversary edition of the Apple Watch, and updated AirPods.\nThat\u2019s a lot of hardware, but Wall Street isn\u2019t banking on new iPhones or special edition Apple Watches to move the company\u2019s stock price. Instead, all eyes will be on Apple\u2019s generative AI-powered Apple Intelligence platform.\nApple Intelligence is the company\u2019s big swing at bringing generative AI capabilities to consumers\u2019 iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Wall Street wasn\u2019t very keen on how long it took Apple to announce its AI initiative, waiting impatiently as Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted their own AI services for enterprises and consumers.\nBut investors changed their tune when Apple showed off Apple Intelligence at its WWDC developer conference in June, sending the company\u2019s stock price up around 15% and putting it ahead of Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Google for year-to-date performance.\nApple is setting up Apple Intelligence as one of the main selling points for its latest phones, as its software will only run on last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro or newer phones. And analysts are banking on that exclusivity to reinvigorate iPhone sales.\n\u201cApple Intelligence remains the key to unlocking pent-up iPhone demand and accelerating replacement cycle, and we expect Apple's\u2026 event to heavily feature AI integration on the new iPhone 16,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note.\nBut Apple Intelligence could prove to be something more important than a catalyst for iPhone sales. It will also serve as a make-or-break moment for generative AI in the eyes of everyday consumers.\nTake one look at Apple\u2019s invitation for its Sept. 9 show, and it\u2019s clear the company is going all in on AI. From the \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d tagline to the multicolor Apple logo meant to evoke Siri\u2019s revamped look, the company is sending the message that this show will be an AI showcase.\nApple is pouring AI into its software products with features that summarize text message threads, surface priority emails in the Mail app, provide an improved Siri experience, and enable access to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nApple is also including AI staples like writing tools to help gussy up your emails and documents by proofreading your text or reworking it to sound more professional or concise. The company is also expecting developers to jump on board the AI train, building out new apps that take advantage of the technology through Apple\u2019s devices.\n\u201cWe estimate this could result in incremental Services high margin growth annually of $10 billion for Apple as this all kicks in and will be the start of a new multi-pronged AI revenue stream that is both hardware and software driven,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note.\n\u201cWe believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front,\u201d Ives added. And with that, a $30 to $40 per share bump \u2014 pushing the company\u2019s market cap to the $4 trillion mark.\nApple isn\u2019t the only company to bring generative AI to its smartphone line. Samsung has Galaxy AI software, combining its own AI with some of Google\u2019s AI smarts. Google also offers its own Gemini AI platform via its new Pixel 9 line of devices, including its Pixel 9 Pro Fold foldable phone.\nApple, however, has done a far better job explaining its AI offerings than either of its competitors. It made the software seem like a must-have for users during its June developer conference, explaining how it integrates across the company\u2019s various apps and services in a way that Samsung and Google haven\u2019t been able to by making AI seem more personal.\nBut Apple is going to have to do more than that to get people excited about its AI efforts. I\u2019ve been using Apple\u2019s beta software on my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and while I appreciate its ability to summarize long text message threads between friends \u2014 no one likes having to sift through 40 messages to find out what they\u2019re doing for dinner \u2014 and find the priority email feature in Mail helpful, it\u2019s difficult to say whether that will be enough to spark consumer interest in the technology.\nApple will also need to take great care to ensure that its Apple Intelligence is accurate and not prone to the kinds of hallucinations that have led to criticisms of AI software like Google\u2019s AI Overview, which famously told people to add glue to their pizza and to eat rocks.\nAbove all, Apple will need to ensure that Apple Intelligence is something that consumers actually want to use and not a feature the company had to shoehorn into its portfolio to placate investors fearing Apple would miss the boat on the next tech hype train.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  James Brumley, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no denying Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't quite the must-have stock it was when the iPhone was still relatively new. Although it's certainly still one of the market's most respectable prospects, the old spark simply isn't there. It happens.\nHowever, don't let a lack of excitement deter you from stepping into a new position in this name. While the thrill is gone, the upside potential isn't. This company's still got a great deal going for it, even if most investors don't seem to see it or care. Here are the top three reasons to buy Apple stock -- today.\nBy the time it was officially unveiled this on Sept. 9,\u00a0little about Apple's latest iPhone -- the iPhone 16 -- surprised anyone. The basic and the so-called \"plus\" versions of the world's most popular smartphone offer an improved camera and a more functional action button.\nOf course, these updated devices are powered by an A18 processor chip capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) duties directly from the phone itself. (In almost all cases right now, this work is handled in the cloud, slowing down the workflow.)\nThe market's response to the unveiling was ho-hum. Investors already knew not only that the iPhone 16, scheduled to go on sale later this month, would be capable of handling AI work but also that the Apple Intelligence software that will turn a properly equipped iPhone or iPad into a true AI device won't be made available until next month. And even then, it won't be a worldwide launch of everything Apple intends for its AI platform to be.\nEvery day's delay is an opportunity for competing tools like Alphabet's Google Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot to become the AI tool of choice for consumers.\nWhat's largely being underestimated is the continued strength of the Apple brand and users' loyalty to it.\u00a0Bloomberg Intelligence reports that 93% of current owners of Apple devices would buy another Apple device versus only 80% of current users of Android devices. The option to own a true self-contained AI device might just be the upgrade this crowd's been waiting for. And there's little doubt Apple Intelligence will be Apple's typical easy-to-use tech.\nThe right tailwind is certainly in place, too. Technology market research outfit IDC believes the world will see sales of 234.2 million generative-AI-capable smartphones this year, en route to 912 million such devices in 2028. Apple's sure to win at least its fair share of this long-term growth. The slow rollout of Apple Intelligence isn't likely to be a lingering problem.\nWhen the iPhone was still relatively new, it in and of itself was a profit center. And in most regards, it's still a huge source of revenue, making up about half of Apple's sales.\nAs time has marched on, though, the iPhone has become a means to another end. Namely, it's driving demand for digital services, like apps, streaming video, music, and more, now that people have easy access to such offerings at their fingertips. Services are now Apple's second-biggest revenue driver behind the iPhone, in fact, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the company's top line.\nThis obviously still leaves the iPhone as Apple's primary breadwinner. There's a detail worth noting here, however. While devices like the iPhone ultimately account for three-fourths of the company's total business, in that it's a much higher-margin business, services generate nearly 40% of Apple's gross income.\nData source: Apple. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\nThat proportion is only apt to continue swelling, too, as more consumers purchase the new iPhone for its AI capabilities and then end up using other features and offerings of the iOS ecosystem.\nFinally, you may want to take on a new position in Apple stock sooner than later for the simplest of reasons -- it's down from July's peak despite the recent publicity event that introduced a range of improved and updated consumer technologies, such as the aforementioned iPhone 16.\nIt's not quite the norm. More often than not Apple's September events light a fresh fire under the stock. This year, shares started soaring in June in response to early glimpses at the company's long-term AI ambitions. By July, most of what was confirmed this past week was already priced into the stock, and then some. That's why the stock's been sliding since then, continuing to do so after this month's high-profile unveiling.\nThat's not likely to be the case much longer, though.\nSee, despite Apple's late-to-the-party, slow-moving entry into the AI race and the stock's recent pullback, Wall Street remains bullish. The majority of the analyst community still considers the stock a strong buy, with a consensus target price of $247.22. That's about 11% above the stock's present price, which isn't much, but it's certainly a start.\nAs Apple's AI efforts start to prove themselves marketable growth drivers, don't be surprised to see Wall Street begin raising its average price target. Of course, this will blaze a trail for the ticker to move higher as well.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri\u2019s new design features an elegant glowing light around the screen edge when active, and its functionality extends to provide device support and answer detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.In a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.

ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide writing tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\nAlthough Apple\u2019s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company\u2019s strong growth driver. In the fiscal third quarter, Services revenues grew 14.1% year over year to $24.21 billion and accounted for 28.2% of sales.The Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay.

For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.59X compared with the sector\u2019s 26.47X and higher than the median of 27.64X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nApple\u2019s AI push is attractive for growth-oriented investors. The Services business has emerged as AAPL\u2019s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple\u2019s investment profile attractive.However, Apple\u2019s sluggish China business has been a headache.

In this edition...why Apple's AI bet on the iPhone 16 matters to more than just Apple; a once-promising German AI startup pivots away from its own AI models; North Dakota emerges on the frontlines of the AI data center wars. \nApple announced yesterday that its new iPhone 16 will go on sale later this month. The phone is the first to be designed specifically to support the company\u2019s \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d features, including new AI photo editing tools, an improved version of Siri, generative AI writing aids, and the ability to summarize emails and notifications. Access to OpenAI's GPT models through Siri is coming too. It\u2019s all powered by Apple\u2019s new operating system, iOS 18, and inside the phone by Apple\u2019s custom A18 chip which has been designed to support AI workloads.\nMany of these new AI features won\u2019t roll out to customers until later in the year, or even next year. Overall though, the phone represents a big bet that demand for AI features will convince consumers to upgrade, awakening iPhone sales from a somnolent period that has been a drag on Apple\u2019s revenues and its share price. Sales of the iPhone 16 are also poised to be a bellwether for the overall consumer generative AI market. And so far, the strength of that market is far from certain.\nYes, OpenAI and Meta both announced seemingly impressive user numbers last week. OpenAI said 200 million people now use ChatGPT each week. Meta said its AI chatbot had 400 million active monthly users and 185 million weekly users. Those numbers are an indicator that there is a real consumer market for gen AI products.\nBut it's unclear that an upgraded digital assistant and some new gen AI writing and photo editing tools will really be enough to convince people to shell out between $799 and $1,200 (depending on the version) for a new phone, especially when you can already access ChatGPT or Meta\u2019s AI on your existing devices.\nThe real money from gen AI is being made in the enterprise, even as some chief information officers complain they aren\u2019t seeing enough value from gen AI software. OpenAI revealed last week that it now has 1 million paying business customers for its service and that 92% of the Fortune 500 are using OpenAI\u2019s models in some capacity. Meta has said its Llama large language models\u2014which it makes available for free\u2014have been downloaded some 350 million times. That figure is an indicator that developers are trying to build AI applications based on Llama. Moreover, it's evidence that the generative AI boom is still far from petering out. (Meanwhile Anthropic has belatedly entered the enterprise AI space as my colleague Sage Lazarro pointed out in this newsletter on Thursday.)\nOne thing that is apparent from this past week\u2019s news is the extent to which the next big technology platform\u2014AI\u2014is likely to be dominated by the same set of giant tech companies that currently rule the roost: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Apple, alongside AI chip titan Nvidia. There was a brief moment, 18 months ago, when a few of these giants looked vulnerable. ChatGPT, some argued, was poised to be a Google-killer. Apple and Amazon both seemed hopelessly behind in their efforts to build large language models and integrate them into their product lineup.\nBut that moment was vanishingly brief. It is now becoming apparent that while the pecking order of these giants might be scrambled by AI, as a group their preeminence is unlikely to be usurped.\nOpenAI is the closest of any upstart to breaking into this top tier, but even it is completely dependent on the largesse of the tech giants. Its success is largely due to the funding and data center infrastructure Microsoft has provided it. OpenAI seems to be trying to break its dependency on Microsoft\u2014reports are that it is looking to raise billions in new funding in an investment round that could include Apple and Nvidia, as well as Microsoft and a gaggle of Silicon Valley venture capital firms. But the fact OpenAI needs more cash, despite having received a $10 billion commitment from Microsoft a little more than a year ago, is a testament to just how high its current burn rate is and how tricky its path to ever escaping the orbit of its Big Tech patrons will be.\nThis concentration of power should be a concern. As with previous tech platforms, there is a tendency towards monopoly or at least oligopoly. That has costs\u2014in innovation and choice\u2014even if these harms are not always as immediately apparent as higher prices are. In the U.S. and the EU, governments are only now seeking to address the concentration of power inherent in previous platform shifts\u2014to the internet and mobile. Maybe we won\u2019t have to wait as long for regulators to do something about the control these few companies exert over AI\u2019s development. But I\u2019m not holding my breath.\nHere\u2019s more AI news.\nJeremy Kahnjeremy.kahn@fortune.com@jeremyakahn\nBefore we get to the news.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. introduced the latest version of its flagship device, the iPhone 16, betting it can entice consumers with modest hardware upgrades and AI technology that\u2019s still on the horizon.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis\nHousing\u2019s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race\nFor Tenants, AI-Powered Screening Can Be a New Barrier to Housing\nAfter a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates\nChicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook unveiled the smartphone \u2014 alongside new watches and AirPods earbuds \u2014 at an event Monday that was infused with the promise of artificial intelligence. The iPhone 16 was built for AI \u201cfrom the ground up,\u201d he said, though the capabilities will only be gradually added to the device via software updates.\nListen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nIt\u2019s a gambit for the tech titan, which has been racing to develop a suite of tools called Apple Intelligence. Though Apple has been touting the technology since its developers conference in June, the software won\u2019t be included in the initial versions of the new iPhones. They\u2019re set to go on sale Friday, with the product reaching stores on Sept. 20.\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Apple software chief Craig Federighi said during the presentation. The first set of tools will be released as part of a beta test in October, he said, \u201cwith more features rolling out in the months to come.\u201d\nAs part of the event, Apple unveiled a version of its smartwatch with a bigger screen and the ability to detect sleep apnea. And it touted new software that can turn AirPods into hearing aids.\nThe iPhone debut was the centerpiece of the presentation, though the company only made relatively minor changes to the device\u2019s look and hardware features. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will be available in new colors and get a customizable Action button that had only been available on higher-end models. There\u2019s also a more powerful chip and new Camera Control button that lets users snap pictures and access camera functions.\nNew Pro models, meanwhile, will get slightly larger displays and thinner borders. They will run an A18 Pro processor with an upgraded neural engine \u2014 the part of the chip designed to handle AI tasks. The phones have more powerful camera components and video features, letting them capture higher-resolution photos and more cinematic slow-motion clips.\nApple is playing catch-up in the world of generative artificial intelligence, where tech peers like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp. have made strides. Monday\u2019s presentation was partly a pitch to consumers \u2014 and Wall Street \u2014 that Apple should be taken seriously in AI.\nBut the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s AI technology is still in early stages. The Apple Intelligence tools have faced numerous delays, and many key features won\u2019t arrive until next year. For now, the technology is focused on summarizing messages and notifications, rather than matching the gee-whiz capabilities of rival systems.\nApple shares slipped more than 1.5% during the event, though they rebounded later. That kind of ho-hum reaction is fairly typical during Apple presentations. Most new features are reported ahead of time, and there were few surprises during Monday\u2019s presentation.\nAI was a major theme of the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. local time. The company hopes to use the Apple Intelligence software to entice consumers to buy upgraded devices, since customers will need a recent iPhone to handle the capabilities.\nApple Intelligence will include an upgraded Siri digital assistant and the ability to create custom emoji with text prompts. The event\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d theme was a reference to the look of Siri\u2019s new interface.\nBut much of the technology won\u2019t be ready right away, potentially limiting its impact on iPhone sales. Even when Apple Intelligence debuts in October, it will be a beta test \u2014 an early version for more adventurous consumers.\nThat \u201cindicates a lot of the features are still being fine-tuned for release and not ready for prime time,\u201d eMarketer analyst Gadjo Sevilla said in a note. \u201cThe focus on security and privacy is a likely reason for feature delays.\u201d\nThe entry-level iPhone will continue to start at $799, with the Plus model selling for $899. The iPhone 16 Pro is $999, while the larger Pro Max version is $1,199.\nApple Watch\nThe new Apple Watch \u2014 the Series 10 edition \u2014 has 30% more screen area, even with a thinner design. The sleep apnea feature will be available in more than 150 regions, the company said.\nThe new watch is about 10% thinner than the Series 9 version. It also comes in a new titanium chassis that\u2019s lighter than aluminum models. The device starts at $399 and will be released Sept. 20. A new version of the higher-end Ultra version also was announced, and it goes on sale that day for $799.\nThe event included an updated version of the standard $129 AirPods, which shrinks the size of the case and adds a USB-C charger. A $179 version also will be available \u2014 a midrange product \u2014 with noise cancellation. That used to only be available on the higher-end AirPods Pro.\nThe company introduced a new line of $549 AirPods Max headphones in fresh colors, also with USB-C charging. Like the other products, the devices will be released on Sept. 20. Apple didn\u2019t debut a new version of its AirPods Pro, but introduced features such as a hearing test and the ability to act as a hearing aid. Those capabilities will be offered as a software update this fall.\nEvent Timing\nThe iPhone debut is usually Apple\u2019s most important announcement of the year. The device accounts for roughly half of the company\u2019s annual revenue, and it helps fuel additional sales in the form of accessories and services.\nApple doesn\u2019t typically hold its iPhone launch on a Monday, but the earlier timing let the company get out ahead of an eventful Tuesday: A US presidential debate is scheduled for that day, and there should a resolution in a European Commission case over whether Apple has to pay $14 billion in taxes.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\nChina Can Avoid Japan\u2019s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea\u2019s Path\nThe Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single\nUS Oil Boom Turns Kamala Harris Into an Unlikely Fracking Supporter\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a great stock to own since late September 2019. During that five-year stretch, its shares produced a 328% total return. This gain absolutely trounces the broader S&P 500.\nThe momentum has continued this year, as Apple is up 18% (as of Sept. 27). But investors care about what the future holds. Where will this consumer discretionary stock be in five years?\nApple's business model has shifted in the past several years. To be more specific, services have become a bigger contributor to financial success. Offerings like iCloud, Pay, TV+, and the App Store, among others, are a growth engine, posting 14% sales growth in the latest fiscal quarter (Q3 2024, ended June 29).\nEven better, services boast a stellar gross margin of 74%. And they provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for Apple, which is exactly what shareholders want.\nHowever, this remains a hardware company at its core. Sales of physical products represented 72% of overall revenue in Q3. These hardware devices are still key to Apple's success. The iPhone in particular accounted for 46% of Apple's sales last quarter.\nAlthough services are becoming more important, I think five years from now, products, especially the iPhone, will still be the main aspect of the company's financial performance. Consequently, the business will most likely look very similar to how it does today.\nBut artificial intelligence (AI) is set to feature more prominently. Apple just released its 16th lineup of iPhones. And these newer devices will be compatible with Apple Intelligence, the company's new AI-powered software that can help users summarize text, boost their writing skills, and edit photos. The hope is that AI can spur greater demand for new iPhone sales, but this hasn't been the case so far.\nApple might have been a wildly successful investment in the past five years. But I don't believe this will be true over the next five.\nThe reason I think this way partly has to do with the valuation. If you want to buy Apple shares, you'll pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.7. On the one hand, it's easy to argue that such a dominant business deserves a high multiple. After all, Apple possesses one of the world's strongest brands, is incredibly profitable, and is even a top holding for Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway.\nHowever, that P/E ratio is 22% higher than the stock's trailing five-year average. Expectations have outgrown the underlying fundamentals. Paying a premium valuation would make sense only if investors believed that Apple was going to register outsize growth in the years ahead. It's hard to be optimistic in this regard, though.\nCompared to five or 10 years ago, Apple is now a very mature enterprise. There are more than 2.2 billion active devices scattered across the globe. While this figure inches higher each quarter, there are simply fewer opportunities to get these products into more hands, especially the iPhone. Revenue is slated to increase at just a 5.8% yearly rate between fiscal 2023 and 2026.\nAnd even though the iPhone is arguably the single most successful product of all time, newer updates aren't as revolutionary as they once were. This doesn't incentivize consumers to switch to the newest model, which can pressure revenue growth. When it comes to AI, the jury is still out on whether or not people even want or need these new features. It could all prove to be hype.\nThere's a very good chance that the stock could underperform the broader S&P 500 over the next five years. And that's why I don't own shares.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 774% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 169% for the S&P 500.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 30, 2024\nNeil Patel and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "Author": "  GlobalData ",
        "Text": "Apple has received a warning from the European Union to make its iPhone and iPad operating systems (OS) compatible with rival technologies or face potential fines under the Digital Markets Act (DMA).\nThe EU\u2019s regulators have mandated that Apple comply with new regulations requiring full OS functionality with other technologies within six months.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Brussels-based authority's announcement stops short of a formal investigation but signals the EU's intent to force Apple to redesign its services, allowing competitors access to the iPhone's and iPad's operating systems.\nApple, headquartered in Cupertino, California, said it offers developers ways to request more interoperability with its operating systems, emphasising user security protection.\nThe company argued that compromising the security measures integrated into its systems over time would endanger European consumers.\nThe DMA's objectives include granting developers access to crucial Apple features, such as Siri voice commands and the payment chip.\nEU executive vice-president in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager said: \u201cToday is the first time we use specification proceedings under the DMA to guide Apple towards effective compliance with its interoperability obligations through constructive dialogue.\n\u201cWe are focused on ensuring fair and open digital markets. Effective interoperability, for example with smartphones and their operating systems, plays an important role in this. This process will provide clarity for developers, third parties and Apple.\n\u201cWe will continue our dialogue with Apple and consult third parties to ensure that the proposed measures work in practice and meet the needs of businesses.\u201d\nIf Apple fails to comply with the DMA, the EU may initiate a formal investigation, which could result in fines of up to 10% of Apple's global annual sales.\nIn addition to this warning, Apple is already under scrutiny in a parallel investigation concerning its App Store policies for developers, which could also incur significant penalties.\nEarlier this month, Apple unveiled the iPhone 16, hoping to attract customers with modest hardware improvements and forthcoming AI technology.\nIn June 2024, the US tech giant announced that certain features would be withheld from the EU market due to the DMA's stipulations on operating system compatibility with third-party applications.\n\"Apple faces EU compliance demand for iPhone OS \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Ashar Jawad ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ\u2019s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\nWith that said, let\u2019s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\nWe scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American technology company headquartered in California, which is known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related services. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now, with 184 hedge funds holding a stake in the company at the end of Q2 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database.\nThe recently concluded third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was one of the best quarters for the company in a long while, during which it reported a June quarter record revenue of $85.8 billion, up 5% compared to the same period last year. Revenue from products totaled $61.6 billion, representing a 2% year-over-year increase. The growth was aided by the launch of iPad Pro and iPad Air. Services revenue reached an all-time high of $24.2 billion during Q3, up 14% from last year. The company reported a gross margin of 46.3%, which fell within the higher range of guidance for the quarter. EPS was measured at $1.40, beating estimates of $1.35 per share.\nThe company generated $39.3 billion from the sale of iPhones, which accounted for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue for the quarter. However, the figure was down 1% year-over-year. This was likely due to a 6.5% drop in sales from Greater China, where the iPhone faces fierce competition from local manufacturers like Huawei. Mac revenue reached $7 billion, up 2% from last year. The biggest success story for the quarter came from iPad, which registered a 24% revenue growth to a total of $7.2 billion.\nWhile the decline in iPhone sales has created some bearish sentiment around the stock, most investors are bullish on the company in anticipation of the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the new iPhone 16. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\nStreet analysts have maintained a consensus Buy rating on the stock and a share price target of $242.41, representing a 5.89% upside from its current trading level.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at a few announcements.\nUnsurprisingly, the iPhone 16 Pro was a major focal point during the event, with the company unveiling several new features for the model. A few of the notable features include better battery life, AI capabilities (coming later this fall), and the biggest display screen yet.\nImportantly, the iPhone 16 Pro is built for Apple Intelligence, which is the personal intelligence system that helps consumers write, express themselves, and get things done effortlessly. In addition, the iPhone 16\u2019s glass is reportedly two times tougher than any other smartphone glass, providing a durable nature.\nThe company\u2019s iPhone results have been somewhat mixed as of late, delivering both misses and beats over the past year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe new Apple Watch 10 was also unveiled, featuring its biggest and most advanced display yet. The watch also comes with Apple\u2019s first wide-angle OLED Display, making screen reading easier at a glance. Similar to the iPhone, Apple\u2019s Wearable results have been somewhat mixed as of late, exceeding and falling short of expectations over the past year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple\u2019s earnings outlook has shifted bullishly across the board over the last several months, with the trend particularly notable for its current and next fiscal years. The mega-cap giant is forecasted to post 9% EPS growth on 2% higher sales in FY24.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShares trade at elevated valuation multiples, consistent with its history over the years being a high-growth name. Still, the current PEG ratio works out to 2.3X, above the five-year median considerably and suggesting that investors are paying a premium for the earnings growth expected.\nIt\u2019s been no secret that the company\u2019s growth has been stalling, but perhaps recent news surrounding its new lineup of products can reverse the trend. Apple is in the very early innings of its AI offerings, a key aspect to keep in mind when sizing up its long-term prospects.\nAnd despite slowing growth, the company still remains a cash-generating machine, posting $34.1 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest quarter.\nTech titan Apple AAPL unveiled several new products and models in today\u2019s event, kicking off a big September for the company. The biggest highlight of the event for investors is likely the news surrounding the AI offerings inside the iPhone 16 Pro, though it\u2019s critical to note that it won\u2019t initially come loaded with these features.\nA sleeker Apple Watch and new versions of AirPods will also help keep its Wearables segment healthy, which has shown great growth over recent years.\nAll in all, Apple could be seen as a dark horse in the AI race, keeping things relatively quiet compared to many other companies touting their offerings. While the valuation multiples are a bit rich for the current forecasted growth, the stock remains a prime long-term selection for investors\u2019 portfolios given its immense earnings power and cash-rich position.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Caitlyn Moorhead ",
        "Text": "Why is Apple, one of the biggest and most valuable names in technology, now turning its bestselling headphones into lower-cost hearing aids? The answer is that Apple has been steadily expanding its reach into health tech, offering innovative products that enhance the quality of life for users. Though retirees may not be the company\u2019s biggest demographic when comes to new and innovative products, that doesn\u2019t mean seniors don\u2019t want to listen to what\u2019s coming out for hearing devices.\nApple has heard what its customers are asking for, and one of its latest ventures is into the hearing aid market to provide affordable, high-quality hearing solutions. This move is particularly significant for retirees, many of whom are living on fixed incomes and need hearing aids but find them too expensive.\nRead Next: Cutting Expenses for Retirement? Here\u2019s the No. 1 Thing To Get Rid Of First\nFor You: 9 Easy Ways To Build Wealth That Will Last Through Retirement\nAs the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age, this is a great time for Apple to boost its sales in other areas outside of phones and computers. Here\u2019s a look at how Apple is potentially making hearing aids more accessible and how retirees can take full advantage of Apple\u2019s technology.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nApple is getting ready for a full fall push of the \u201cHearing Health\u201d launch. This will include access to features such as its Hearing Test, Hearing Protection and Hearing Aid options through the use of its AirPods Pro 2 along with an iPhone or iPad. Here are some key takeaways.\nApple is claiming this will be an all-in-one hearing health experience, which makes it convenient for its older or hard-of-hearing clientele.\nAny feature included will be available through a software update.\nWith the software update scheduled for the fall, it would instantly turn your AirPods Pro 2 into a medical device and a more accessible and affordable form of hearing aid.\nAs a medical device, this could be the best low-cost option for lower-income people, such as retirees who need hearing aids but may not be able to afford them, according to some audiologists.\nApple\u2019s AirPods Pro 2s cost anywhere from $130 to $200, depending on where you get them and whether they are refurbished, whereas hearing aids can run you upward of $1,000 to $3,500 per device.\nCheck Out: I\u2019m Planning My Retirement: 5 Expenses I Wish I Had Cut Sooner\nApple\u2019s new Hearing Aid feature is designed for mild to moderate hearing loss, which affects many people. This could be ideal for someone who may be on the fence as to whether or not they should invest. The price point of hearing aids is usually the biggest deterrent for buyers, and Apple is working out a win-win situation. Yes, you have to own the AirPods, but these are multifunctional and a decent percentage of people already own them.\nThe time and money that go into finding the right pair of hearing aids is often an obstacle, and this Apple solution seemingly solves that. Essentially, instead of paying, say, $2,000 per hearing aid, you can pay $200 for headphones that can do similar things.\nApple\u2019s Hearing Aid feature comes as part of the company\u2019s broader commitment to making health technology more affordable and widely available. Utilizing the technology embedded in its popular AirPods Pro 2 and iPhone, Apple is providing hearing assistance solutions that cater to mild to moderate hearing loss. Here\u2019s how retirees can take advantage.\nInvest in AirPods Pro 2. These typically retail for a fraction of the cost of traditional hearing aids and will have built-in hearing assistance features that can help improve sound clarity. For retirees who already use Apple products, this can be an easy and cost-effective way to enhance hearing.\nCheck your health insurance discounts. While Apple\u2019s hearing solutions are significantly more affordable, it\u2019s worth checking whether your health insurance provider offers discounts or reimbursements for hearing-related products. Some Medicare Advantage plans, for example, may cover part of the cost of hearing aids or assistive devices.\nLeverage Apple\u2019s accessibility features. Apple\u2019s devices come with a range of built-in accessibility features. By navigating to the accessibility settings on an iPhone or iPad, retirees can fine-tune sound amplification settings to better suit their hearing needs. Features like Live Listen can turn your iPhone into a microphone that transmits sounds directly to your AirPods, making it easier to hear conversations in crowded settings.\nThe bottom line is that Apple\u2019s push into the hearing aid market is a game changer, especially for older adults who need assistance with their hearing but have been priced out of the market. With innovative features, seamless integration into existing products and prices that are far more affordable than traditional hearing aids, Apple is offering a compelling solution for retirees.\nApple\u2019s entrance into this market is a welcome development that could bring better hearing within reach for millions of people. Keep an eye on this evolving space \u2014 Apple is just getting started.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n7 Five Below Items Retirees Need To Buy Before Fall Ends\n6 Strategies Anyone Can Use to Pay Off Debt\nI'm a Debt Expert: Here's How Social Media Warps Our Perceptions of Debt\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Apple Is Making Low-Cost Hearing Aids \u2014 Here\u2019s How Retirees Can Take Advantage\n"

It is already facing a parallel investigation into its App Store rules for developers, which could also lead to hefty penalties.\nEarlier this month, Apple announced the latest version of its flagship device, the iPhone 16, betting it can entice consumers with modest hardware upgrades and AI technology that\u2019s still on the horizon.\nBut in June, the US giant said that certain features \u2014 including Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing \u2014 would be held back from the EU, due to the DMA\u2019s requirements on operating systems to work with third-party apps.\n(Updates with Apple statement in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPalantir\u2019s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank\nFive Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business\nThreats to Local US Election Officials Are Rising, and More Workers Are Quitting\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nIn Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apply (NASDAQ: AAPL) regained its title as the largest company in the world and currently leads second-place Microsoft by about 11%. That's a sizable lead, which may cause some investors to wonder if Apple stock is a buy right now.\nLet's take a look, as the answer may surprise you.\nApple's business isn't difficult to understand. It mostly sells hardware, such as phones, laptops, and tablets. However, it also offers some subscription services.\nWhile the subscription part of the business may be a smaller part, it's really the only part that has performed recently. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ending June 29), sales in its Services division rose 14%. While Mac and iPad sales also grew in Q3, iPad sales significantly shrunk in Q2 and Q1.Besides that, all of its other divisions shrank in Q3, including its largest segment: the iPhone.\nOverall, it has been a hard road selling its hardware over the past few years, but Apple investors are hoping a new technology could spur a round of upgrades.\nApple recently announced its take on artificial intelligence (AI): Apple Intelligence. This feature is due for beta release sometime this fall and is Apple's integration of generative AI into its ecosystem. Although it lags well behind its Android competition in this integration, it will likely still be a hit due to the loyal Apple following.\nTwo factors are at play as to why it could improve Apple's current business state. First, these features will only be available on iPhones 15 Pro and Pro Max or new models. This means that some cheaper models and all of the existing phones will be excluded from Apple Intelligence, which some estimate to be 90% of the iPhone user base. This could drive a massive upgrade cycle when the iPhone 16 launches later this month, which would provide Apple a much-needed sales boost.\nSecond, it's likely that Apple is also playing the subscription game here. Apple's competitors are offering AI tools for free on their devices for a limited time. After a year, a subscription fee will likely follow, which may irk the consumer but will be a huge boost to Apple's recurring revenue if it becomes a must-have feature.\nThese two factors are why Apple has regained its title as the world's largest company, but if this initiative fails, the stock could be in for trouble.\nIf I were to present you with the following information about a stock, would you buy it?\nMetric\nFigure\nLast Quarter Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth\n4.9%\nOne-Year Average Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth\n0.5%\nForward Price-to-Earnings Ratio\n33.3\nData source: YCharts. YOY = Year over Year.\nYou'd probably think that's an expensive stock for hardly any revenue growth, but that's where Apple is trading at. Now, let's compare three more companies.\nMetric\nCompany A\nCompany B\nCompany C\nLast Quarter Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth\n22.1%\n13.6%\n122.4%\nOne-Year Average Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth\n24.3%\n13.4%\n213.8%\nForward Price-to-Earnings Ratio\n24.1\n20.6\n38\nData source: YCharts. YOY = Year over Year.\nAll of those look like far more attractive investments, as A and B are growing much faster and trade at a far lower price tag than Apple. Or, company C is growing at a rapid pace but isn't that much more expensive.\nCompany C is an easy guess: Nvidia. But A and B may be a bit more tricky: Company A is Meta Platforms, and Company B is Alphabet.\nThese two are doing far better than Apple from a business perspective but don't have near the pedigree that Apple stock does. So, does Apple deserve the premium? I'd say no.\nFor Apple's valuation to reach the same levels as Meta or Alphabet, its earnings would need to increase by about 50%. That's a tall task even if Apple's iPhone sales ramp up, and it's likely-to-launch Apple Intelligence subscription does well.\nApple holds a huge premium over its peers but doesn't have much to show for it. As a result, I think there are far better buys in the market than Apple, and investors would be better off looking at one of its peers for an investment right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\nOn September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.\nAccording to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.\nHe believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.\nAs the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.\nMiller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.\nMiller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.\nNow that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company behind the iPhone, is one of the best stocks to buy for the long term. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nIn the FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple\u2019s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. The launch of iPhone 16 and iOS 18 is expected to drive strong financial results for the company for the rest of 2024.\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 10% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. According to the Insider Monkey database,\u00a0 Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\"\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0 ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nInvestors are still digesting the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate cut and charting the path forward. Roger Altman, Evercore founder and senior chairman, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the Fed was not \u201cbehind the curve\u201d but it went with a higher-than-expected rate cut amid labor market concerns.\nAsked if he thinks we are headed toward a soft landing scenario, Altman said yes, as he believes growth is \u201cresilient\u201d and corporate profit outlook is good. Altman said equity markets are headed to have their best year since 1960.\n\u201cIf the landing is finished and the Fed hits its target, Powell will deserve an A and it would be a pretty miraculous achievement,\u201d Altman said.\nWhile the analyst believes currently it\u2019s a \u201cnear perfect\u201d overall environment for the market, he did point to \u201cstorm clouds\u201d gathering over the international stage including the expanding crisis in the Middle East, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and America\u2019s overall fiscal situation.\nFor this article we chose 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nWall Street has started to feel that the high expectations they had with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone might not materialize after all.\nShipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n\u201cWait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,\u201d said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. \u201cOn average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.\u201d\nIn the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they\u2019re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features. However, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon. However, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Brian Heater ",
        "Text": "When Apple unveiled its AI plans at WWDC in June, analysts suggested the feature could put the iPhone 16 on track for another \"supercycle.\" Like the addition of 5G before it, industry watchers believed that Apple Intelligence\u2019s arrival might convince holdouts to bite the bullet and upgrade their device.\nWe\u2019ll have a much better picture when the company reveals the iPhone 16 at tomorrow\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d event in Cupertino. In the meantime, however, it's believed that Apple Intelligence's slow rollout could significantly hamper supercycle potential.\nIn June, Apple showed the world a take on AI firmly in-line with its mission statement of prioritizing user experience. Trained on small models -- instead of the massive black boxes behind services like Google Gemini and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT -- Apple\u2019s play is centered around improving existing experiences through generative AI.\nAs Bloomberg notes today, however, delays could impact the iPhone 16's bottom line. WWDC offered a lot of big promises, but we\u2019re unlikely to see many delivered until 2025. Regional limitations present key roadblocks as well, including in the EU and China -- the latter of which can make or break Apple financials in any given quarter. ChatGPT integration, meanwhile, is also unlikely for launch.\nIn the lead up to WWDC, the industry wondered whether Apple would be able to become a major player with the generative AI competition. But while the developer conference wowed observers with impressive demos, there\u2019s still a lot of catching up to do.\nAt the time of writing, iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max are the only devices approved to run Apple Intelligence. Tomorrow\u2019s event is set to change that, especially as further rumors point to increased uniformity across the iPhone 16 line. The base models are expected to get A18 chips, with the Pros, fittingly, getting an A18 Pros.\nWhile sales are incredibly important to Apple and its shareholders, Apple Intelligence is a massive, multi-faceted undertaking, and rushing it out too early could have a longer term adverse impact on the company's bottom line than a staggered rollout.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/apple-intelligence-delays-could-impede-iphone-16-supercycle/\n"

        "Text": "Apple's artificial intelligence offering, Apple Intelligence, was the star of its annual iPhone event on Monday.\nBut for investors, the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence could pose a problem. While Apple's iPhone 16 hits stores on Sept. 20, the software update required for Apple Intelligence won't be available for US English users until October.\nThe disconnect between the hardware and software may have been one reason why Apple stock didn't move much on the news. Shares of the iPhone maker were down by about 0.9% during the company's \"Glowtime\" presentation in Cupertino, Calif., and they were up less than 1% over the three days since the event.\n\u201cNo huge surprises,\u201d Goldman Sachs senior equity research analyst Michael Ng told Yahoo Finance about the Apple iPhone unveiling. \u201cI think it was straight down the fairway,\u201d he said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on Tuesday.\nNg, who has a Buy rating on Apple, said he's \"constructive\" on the stock and that its performance is par for the course on iPhone rollout days.\nHis team estimated that Apple stock has historically underperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) by 70 basis points on launch days. On Monday, that underperformance hit 100 basis points, which Ng said was \"mostly in line with historic events.\"\nApple stock tends to perform better a month or even two months out from launch days. Last year, shares of Apple were off by 1% a day after the iPhone 15 was announced. 60 days later, the stock was up 6%, according to Bank of America data. In 2019, shares were up 3% the day after Apple revealed the iPhone 11 and gained 20% over the next two months.\n\"We think that there's an underappreciated uplift in their normalized earnings power as more people start to upgrade their iPhones,\" Ng said.\nThe big question for Apple and its shareholders is whether AI will be enough to drive consumers to upgrade their smartphones.\n\"There\u2019s a tremendous amount of debate about whether or not AI is going to be that demand driver,\" Ng said. \"I certainly believe that it is.\"\nNg noted that investors have estimated an iPhone sell-through rate of about 225 million to 230 million units for the year. With some of the new features added, Ng's team sees a run rate closer to 250 million to 260 million units.\nThose estimates are driven not just by Apple Intelligence software but also by hardware changes to the phone itself.\n\"We're going to see several different form factor changes over the next several years,\" Ng said. \"The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have larger screen sizes than the iPhone 15, and the rumors for the next couple of years are that the iPhone 17 will be a thinner device [and] the iPhone 18 has the potential to be a foldable.\"\nOthers think Apple's upgrade cycle may take longer to play out as Apple develops its AI capabilities.\n\"I just think there\u2019s no compelling reason that somebody should run out and buy a new iPhone 16,\" Needham analyst Laura Martin told Yahoo Finance. \"You should wait for the [iPhone] 17 because it\u2019s going to have \u2026 cooler stuff and there will be more gen.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Apple Intelligence AI platform stole the show at the company\u2019s \u201cGlowtime\u201d iPhone event on Monday. But a pair of health features the company unveiled point to Apple\u2019s continued push into the healthcare space and may prove just as important to keeping users around as its AI efforts.\nThe capabilities, sleep apnea detection for the Apple Watch and a hearing aid function for the AirPods Pro 2, aren\u2019t yet ready for consumers \u2014 they still need approval from global health authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \u2014 but Apple expects them to be available in the coming weeks.\nThe tech giant\u2019s deeper moves into health tracking are just the latest in its quest to become a major player in the industry. As far back as 2019, CEO Tim Cook said Apple\u2019s greatest contribution to mankind will be in health.\nSo it makes sense that the company would add features to some of its most popular products, the AirPods Pro 2 and Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2, that address well-known health problems. Apple says that an estimated 1 billion people around the world have sleep apnea, a disorder that causes breathing disruptions while sleeping and can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease, but the majority of those individuals don\u2019t know they have it. In its own study, Apple said that 75% of people diagnosed with hearing loss aren\u2019t getting the necessary support they need for it.\nApple is quick to point out that sleep apnea detection isn\u2019t meant to diagnose the condition, but is to be used as a guide to alert you to potential sleep problems that you can bring to your doctor to discuss further testing. The Apple Watch tracks your sleep by detecting micro-movements via its built-in accelerometer.\nApple says it submitted the largest ever study on sleep apnea technology to the FDA to validate the watch\u2019s detection capabilities. During its testing of 1,500 people, the company says its sleep apnea detection didn\u2019t alert on a single person that didn\u2019t at least show signs of mild sleep apnea and that it hit on about two-thirds of true sleep apnea cases.\nSleep apnea detection requires users to wear their watches for at least 10 nights over a 30-day period. The more you wear it during that time, the better. Apple will display results in a new breathing disturbances tab in the Health app, showing if you\u2019re dealing with any breathing disruptions throughout the night.\nIf you\u2019ve experienced enough sleep disturbances, the Health app will alert you that you\u2019re showing signs of sleep apnea. Your breathing can change for any number of reasons from night to night, whether that\u2019s due to a cold or drinking alcohol. Requiring users to wear their watches for 10 nights should help account for those outlier situations.\nI\u2019ve got sleep apnea and sleep with a CPAP mask every night. But I spent years experiencing awful sleep problems without knowing what the problem was. It took both my former editor and my wife to convince me to go take a sleep test and find out I had an issue. Having the Apple Watch\u2019s alerts would have saved me a lot of time wondering whether I should go to the doctor or not.\nApple\u2019s hearing protection and aid feature for the AirPods Pro 2 is similarly impressive. The option will be available via a software update and include the ability to take a five-minute test to determine if you have a form of hearing loss.\nI tried a brief sample of the test: It lasted less than a minute, during which I had to tap the screen each time I heard a beep in my left ear and then my right. It was kind of like the hearing tests you took in school.\nI didn\u2019t get to test the hearing aid feature itself, but Apple is positioning it as a replacement for over-the-counter hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Users with severe hearing problems will still need purpose-built hearing aids.\nStill, offering a hearing test and over-the-counter-equivalent hearing aid option to consumers could prove to be incredibly helpful to people around the world who otherwise might not realize they even have hearing problems.\nApple\u2019s features also act as another way for the company to both draw new users and keep its existing customers from leaving for competing offerings from Samsung and Google, even if Samsung already offers sleep apnea detection in its own smartwatch.\nThe idea is for Apple to prove that its products are invaluable devices that you shouldn\u2019t be without. And with its latest offerings, it seems to do just that. We\u2019ll see how consumers react when Apple releases updates for sleep apnea detection and hearing protection and aids in the weeks ahead.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The company announced a new entry-level AirPods 4, an AirPods 4 version with active noise cancellation, an upgraded AirPods Pro 2 with built-in hearing aid functions, and new colors for AirPods Max over-the-ear headphones\nThe AirPods Pro 2 includes new hearing protection features, reducing louder, more intermittent noise while still preserving the sound of what you're listening to. Apple says it's also including a new five-minute clinically validated hearing test with the AirPods Pro 2. When you're finished, you'll get your results, which you can then share with your doctor.\nApple says 75% of people diagnosed with hearing loss haven't received the support they need. Apple says the new AirPods Pro will get an over-the-counter hearing aid feature. The company says it expects to get clearance from the FDA for the hearing health functions soon.\nThe AirPods 4 get Apple's H2 chip, spatial audio, and improved acoustics. The company further says that you'll now be able to shake your head yes or no if you get a phone call while using your AirPods to answer or decline the call. The AirPods 4 charging case is also smaller, though it still has 30 hours of battery life, and features a USB C charging port.\nApple's AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation also get a number of new features from the AirPods Pro, including conversation awareness and a wireless charging case, while the AirPods Pro Max get a series of stylish new colors.\nApple's AirPods fall under its Wearables, Home, and Accessories business segment along with its Apple Watch, Apple TV hardware, and Apple-branded third-party accessories. In its most recent quarter, Apple said the segment brought in $8.09 billion in revenue, down slightly from the $8.2 billion it saw in the same quarter last year.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe latest trends in AI stocks reflect optimism about the future of AI technology, with companies like NVIDIA continuing to dominate the space. The stock price of the chipmaker that is famous for selling AI GPUs has surged significantly in the past two years. After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion. Analysts, like those at Bank of America, have increased their price target on the shares to around $1,500, citing the potential of NVIDIA to drive AI growth for years to come. Bank of America analysts believe the conversion of global data centers to AI-accelerated computing could require up to $500 billion annually, with NVIDIA playing a key role in this transformation\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nProminent investment firms appreciate the significance of emerging AI trends. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\nThe AI hype is truly global. Tech giant Amazon recently announced that it would invest \u00a38 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Amazon rivals like Google and Microsoft have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around \u00a32.5 billion to expand AI growth. Experts have stressed that AI is not just a short-term trend but a long-term transformative force. Francisco Bido, a top portfolio manager, recently underlined that AI was not a fad, noting the significant impact it had on both the top and bottom lines of many companies.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company recently launched the latest models of the iPhone with AI features as it seeks to capitalize on growing AI interest in the smartphone business. However, with pre-orders for the new phones down from last year and Chinese firms offering the new models at a discount due to soft demand, it seems like Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that come preloaded on the new iPhones, have not been enough to revive the slowing demand for the Apple phones. Apple Intelligence will be available on new devices in English later this year, with support for other languages coming next year.\nDemand for new Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) phones have slowed in China amid increased competition in the Chinese market, which is the largest smartphone market in the world. Apple is competing with Chinese firms like Huawei for phone supremacy. Last week, Huawei unveiled a Z-shaped trifold phone Mate XT just a few hours after Apple launched the iPhone 16 models. The phone shipments for the former have soared 41% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024, as those for the latter dipped by about two percentage points in the same period.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In another victory for the EU\u2019s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, the same court ruled that Google illegally leveraged its search-engine dominance to give a higher ranking to its own product listings.\nVestager \u2014 who is just weeks away from departing the Brussels-based European Commission after two terms \u2014 made Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google top targets after taking up her role in 2014. The Apple decision was by far the biggest in her decade-long campaign for tax fairness, which has also targeted the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and carmaker Stellantis NV\u2019s Fiat. Vestager has argued that selective tax benefits to big firms are illegal state aid that are banned in the EU.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to show European taxpayers that once in a while, tax justice can be done,\u201d Vestager told reporters in Brussels in response to questions on her Apple win.\nApple\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook previously blasted as \u201ctotal political crap\u201d the EU\u2019s 2016 move to order the firm to pay \u20ac13 billion in back taxes, while the commission\u2019s 2017 fine against Google was leveled for abusing its search dominance to give a higher ranking to its own product listings.

Ireland must now decide what to do with its unwanted windfall.\n\u201cWe are disappointed with today\u2019s decision as previously the general court reviewed the facts and categorically annulled this case,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Reveals 12 Stocks Investors Should Monitor Closely.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current state of the economy, noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play. One economy is struggling with higher interest rates, making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive, while the other seems unaffected by these rates. This division explains why, even after a double rate cut, the stock market, including the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, still experienced declines.\n\"There really are two economies in this country. There's one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it's harder to find a job, and then there's another that says we don't really care about where the rates are. That's how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the Dow dipping 103 points, the S&P declining 29 points, and the Nasdaq shedding 31 points.\"\nJim Cramer highlights that many companies, especially retailers and restaurants serving low-income customers, are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts. While this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors, which initially rose in stock prices before selling off, the tech sector in Silicon Valley remains largely unaffected. Cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates, focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers. Their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations.\n\"There are so many companies I talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they can't make their forecasts because rates are too high. We've been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants, especially those that cater to the less well-off. They needed this double rate cut\u2014believe me. It's great for housing, and it can help the industrials; those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted. That is a very typical action.\nAdditionally, he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes, washing machines, or cars. Unlike housing, which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales, the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the home-buying process. While lower rates can encourage new businesses, many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions.\n\"You see, these tech companies aren't selling homes; they aren't selling washing machines or cars or steel or plastic\u2014things worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store. Housing, of course, needs lower mortgage rates to get sales going. Tech doesn't care about mortgage rates; they just want to create software that reduces some of the friction you encounter in the process of buying a home. Lower rates make it more likely that people start new companies, but most new companies are too small to need major enterprise software. Companies we talk to can see small-cap companies go up, but big enterprise software? Not so much.\"\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve cut rates to help control inflation, which benefits more businesses overall. However, in the tech industry, the focus is on increasing efficiency through automation, often resulting in fewer employees. These tech companies aim to avoid being affected by the Fed's decisions because relying on them would indicate weakness and vulnerability to the economic cycle, which they actively seek to evade.\n\"The Fed wanted to be sure that inflation is contained and going in the right direction, which then allowed them to relent and cut by 50 basis points. Now, more businesses in the East can thrive, but out here, the presumption is that all enterprises are trying to raise margins, often by automating everything that can be automated, which means using fewer people. These tech companies are automators; they never want to be hostage to the Fed. They don't want you to be hostage to the Fed because that would be a sign of weakness\u2014a sign of cyclicality. Oh, they hate cyclicality. Why be hostage to the business cycle if you don't have to?\"\nFinally, Jim Cramer emphasizes that many people see artificial intelligence as a key player in today's market. Companies that leverage AI can improve their profit margins, which boosts earnings even if their overall sales are declining. This means that even without increasing sales, AI can help businesses become more profitable.\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)'s launch of the iPhone 16, both the base and Pro models, will be \u201crelatively strong\u201d this year. However, the rollout could be affected by delays in Apple Intelligence, the new system that will incorporate generative AI. Analyst Toni Sacconaghi maintained an \"outperform\" rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and set a price target of $240.\n\"Bernstein said Apple \u2019s launch of the iPhone 16 base and Pro this year should be \u201crelatively strong/normal\u201d but could be skewed by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence, the system that will use generative AI. Analyst Toni Sacconaghi kept his outperform rating and a price target of $240.\"\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s strong outlook is backed by impressive Q2 2024 earnings, with total revenue of $95 billion, an 11% increase from last year, and a net income of about $23 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth is largely driven by robust iPhone sales, which rose 15% thanks to new model releases and upgrades. The iPhone remains central to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s revenue, with high demand for the iPhone 15 series due to its appealing features for both new and existing customers.\nIn addition, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s services segment, which includes iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store, grew by 20%, reflecting successful ecosystem expansion and higher profit margins. Wearables like the Apple Watch and AirPods are also becoming popular, driven by increased consumer interest in health and fitness.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s planned entry into augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets with a new headset is expected to create new revenue opportunities and strengthen its presence in emerging technologies. Strong brand loyalty and an integrated ecosystem help retain users and encourage repeat purchases. Recent product launches and sustainability efforts, such as aiming for carbon neutrality in its supply chain by 2030, further attract environmentally conscious consumers.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Incremental improvements in camera and screen quality stopped being noticeable \u2014 and certainly weren\u2019t asked for. The yearly chorus of \u201cbest battery ever\u201d stopped hitting as hard when batteries actually kept working after the two-year mark.\nWith its hardware working too well to be replaced, Apple had to lean into other parts of its growing suite of offerings, especially services.\nInvestors hope that artificial intelligence will solve the hardware sales problem for Apple, as they hope the technology will do for a suite of other things. But many still see the current and near-term embodiments of AI as a solution in search of a problem \u2014 cool functionality, perhaps, but with a currently nebulous use case for most businesses, let alone consumers.\nThe two buzzy letters got plenty of attention, but the event\u2019s shared billing of AI and the suite of safety features makes it clear that Apple is keeping its portfolio diverse, AI expectations managed, and focus firmly on the company\u2019s ecosystem and services. As Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote, the new devices \"focus on driving more users to the ecosystem,\u201d and while the phones cost the same (a nod to tamed inflation?), the sat phone feature will become another revenue stream once the free two-year trial ends.\nApple has long been the GOAT in taking challenging technology and putting it into a consumer-friendly wrapper. Computers, MP3 players, tablets, phones, smartwatches, smart TVs, wireless headphones \u2014 it\u2019s an all-time record.\nAI may also be in this category, existing already but for the most part being a B2B conversation. But as Apple well knows, so are an array of decades-old tech products that have never quite made it into the consumer space.\nI had to dig a hole the other day and found a pipe in the way. I look forward to the iPhone 17\u2019s metal detector.\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "Text": "Apple's (AAPL) partnership with India's second-biggest telecoms firm will give the iPhone maker a sorely needed boost in a content market where it lags far behind the likes of Spotify (SPOT) and Walt Disney (DIS).\nThe US technology giant, working to boost revenue globally from services including apps, payments and media, is set to offer free music and video streaming to many of Bharti Airtel's 281 million customers.\nThe deal is likely to greatly expand the user base for Apple TV+ and Apple Music in a country where Apple has long emphasised the manufacturing side of business to diversify its supply chain beyond China.\nApple builds many of its iPhones in India yet its handsets make up just 6% of the country's 690 million smartphones, versus around 2% in 2019, Counterpoint Research data showed.\n\"The move speaks of Apple's ambitions for India,\" said Nitesh Kripalani, former head of Amazon Prime Video in India. \"The strategy is a time-tested method to catapult presence in markets it considers important.\"\nIn the US, Apple has offered Apple Music for free via some Verizon mobile data plans since 2019, and its Apple TV+ will feature in a Comcast streaming bundle from May.\nIn India, Apple Music will become available to premium users of Airtel's Wynk music app, which will eventually close.\nPostpaid Airtel contracts give about 7 million subscribers access to the ad-free version of Wynk but only a small fraction use it, said a telecom industry source who declined to be named as the figures are confidential.\nNeither Apple nor Airtel responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.\n Music battleground\nApple Music is more tailored to the Indian market compared with the mostly English Apple TV+ with content including Bollywood and regional-language songs, though its library is smaller than Spotify's, said Counterpoint co-founder Neil Shah.\nSpotify has some 3 million paid users in India, Gaana has 1.4 million, Wynk 500,000 and Apple Music 200,000, said an Indian music industry source who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to share estimates publicly.\nNeither Spotify nor Gaana responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.\nOverall, only around 7.5 million people paid for audio streaming services in India last year out of about 185 million users of ad-supported and ad-free apps, showed data from industry group FICCI and consultants EY.\nAirtel will pay Apple a per-user fee \"significantly\" lower than the monthly $1.20 charged each for Apple TV+ and Apple Music in India, said the telecom industry source.\nIn return, it will save millions of rupees in licensing as it looks to shut Wynk and use Apple Music to boost revenue and improve customer loyalty, said a second telecom source\n\"Airtel realised its strength is distribution, not content creation,\" said the source on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to discuss the matter.\nVideo streaming\nApple is a small player in Indian video streaming, with Counterpoint estimating it has fewer than 1 million users. Disney+ Hotstar is the market leader with 38 million users, while estimates showed Netflix has around 10 million.\nHinting at the market's potential, Netflix has repeatedly said it targets 100 million users, without fixing a time frame.\nApple TV+ is known for original series such as \"The Morning Show\" and \"Slow Horses\" however rivals including Netflix and Disney feature more Hindi content with Bollywood actors and even regional-language films.\nDisney and Reliance Industries' JioCinema also stream cricket - India's most popular sport - and the two companies are merging their Indian media assets to create the nation's biggest entertainment firm.\nAirtel, which as telecoms provider lags only Reliance Jio by subscribers, plans to offer packages with several months' free access to Apple TV+, said the second telecoms source.\nThough that will get Apple TV+ into more homes, growth could be hindered as its \"offering is still not optimised locally that much,\" said Counterpoint's Shah.\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n"

        "Author": "  Jabin Bastian ",
        "Text": "Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 3.6% in the morning session after Barclays analyst Tim Long highlighted data that tracks global iPhone availability and wait times, suggesting weak demand for the new iPhone 16. The analyst has an Underweight (Sell) rating and a price target of $186.Separately, the major indices declined (Nasdaq down 1.8%, S&P 500 down 0.9%) amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. NBC News reported (citing White House and Defense Department officials) that the U.S. \"has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.\" Lastly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told investors there is no \"preset course\" regarding the pace of future rate cuts. He added in a speech delivered to the National Association for Business Economics, \"Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course.\" While the markets could still be right about more rate cuts in the near term, Powell's comments added uncertainty to both the cadence and magnitude of cuts. Following these updates, the VIX index (or fear gauge) spiked as the reports created more uncertainty, which investors certainly don't like.\n\u00a0\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nApple\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 2 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nApple is up 21.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $224.76 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $234.82 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,003.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n"

        "Author": "  Munsif Vengattil ",
        "Text": "By Munsif Vengattil\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - Extensive damage from a fire at Tata Group's Apple (AAPL) iPhone component plant in southern India could hamper production ahead of a festive season sales surge, an industry watcher and a source said, forcing the U.S. firm's suppliers to arrange critical parts from China or elsewhere.\nThe weekend blaze has caused an indefinite production halt at Tata's Hosur plant in Tamil Nadu, the only Indian supplier of iPhone back panels and some other parts for both contract manufacturer Foxconn in the country and its own iPhone assembly at another plant.\nHong Kong-based Counterpoint Research told Reuters it estimates local sales of 1.5 million units of iPhone 14 and 15 models during the Indian festive season which runs from late October to early November, with Apple struggling to fulfil as much as 15% of that demand due to the fire.\n\"There will be a 10-15% impact on production of older iPhone models from India. Apple could offset that impact by importing more components, and by re-routing more export inventory towards India,\" said Neil Shah, a co-founder of Counterpoint, which has for years tracked Apple's global shipments.\nApart from local sales, Tata, one of India's biggest conglomerates, also exported iPhones to the Netherlands and United States as well as some parts to China, worth more than $250 million overall, in the year to Aug. 31, commercially available customs data shows.\nTata declined to comment.\nApple suppliers typically carry a three- to four-week stock of back panels, Counterpoint said. An industry source with direct knowledge of the matter estimated, however, that Apple was likely to have stock for eight weeks, and therefore would not see an immediate impact.\nHowever, they added that if the production suspension continues, the U.S. company could set up another assembly line in China or add shifts there to secure parts for India's iPhone manufacturers.\nSupply chain disruptions more generally have cast a shadow over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to attract foreign investors to \"Make in India\", especially in the electronics sector.\nApple has been diversifying beyond China but last year separate fire incidents in India caused suppliers Foxlink and Pegatron to briefly halt operations, with authorities finding much of the fire safety equipment at Foxlink's facility was not functional. Contractors Wistron and Foxconn have also been hit by labour unrest in recent years.\n\"These are temporary setbacks,\" said Prabhu Ram, vice president at Cybermedia Research. \"Continued efforts to improve safety and operational standards are crucial for strengthening India's position as an emerging global electronics manufacturing hub.\"\nTata is among Apple's newest suppliers in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total global iPhone shipments this year, up from 12-14% last year.\nThe fire-hit plant employed 20,000 workers. Another unit in the same Tata complex was due to start making complete iPhones later this year and it is unclear if the incident will cause this to be delayed.\nTata has another iPhone plant near Bengaluru, which it acquired from Wistron last year, and a second one in Tamil Nadu near Chennai, which it is set to acquire from Pegatron.\n(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Kalra, Kirsten Donovan)\n"

However, no such disruptions have been reported for the iPhone 16 models.\nAlthough Apple recently adjusted its wafer orders at TSMC, Morgan Stanley does not believe this reflects softening demand for the iPhone 16.\n\"Apple likely has excessive processor inventories,\" the analysts pointed out, emphasizing that the wafer adjustment is not a direct indication of current demand trends.\nWhile Morgan Stanley's view on the iPhone 16 cycle remains unchanged, they are closely watching this emerging trend of stabilizing lead times as a potentially positive indicator.\nRelated Articles\nApple: iPhone 16 lead times stabilizing - Morgan Stanley\nInsurance brokerage Marsh McLennan strikes $7.75 billion deal for McGriff Insurance Services\nStellantis cuts 2024 profit outlook as US sales crisis deepens\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. shares fell Monday after a closely followed analyst warned that demand for the firm\u2019s new iPhone 16 Pro model has been lower than expected.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nCalifornia\u2019s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority\nNew York City\u2019s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\nTo Build a Happier City, Design for Density\nPipe Fire Near Houston Forces Residents to Evacuate\nPre-order sales, which began Friday for the phone, have tallied an estimated 37 million units, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a report. That\u2019s down almost 13% from last year\u2019s iPhone 15 launch and is a result of weaker-than-anticipated interest in the Pro model of the iPhone 16, says Kuo.\n\u201cOne of the key factors for the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series is that the major selling point, Apple Intelligence, is not available at launch alongside the iPhone 16 release,\u201d Kuo said in the report.\nAfter a weak start to the year, shares in the company rallied the past four months as investors bet Apple\u2019s AI features would boost sales of its latest line of iPhones. They slumped about 3% to start Monday trading, paring their gain this year to roughly 12%, trailing the 15% advance in the Nasdaq 100 Index.\nAnalysts were largely underwhelmed after the company\u2019s launch event last week as most of the hardware announcements were leaked beforehand.

        "Title": "Which Tech Stock Is Better: Apple or Microsoft?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "In this article, I evaluate two leading technology stocks, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), to determine which is the better investment. In preview, I have a neutral view of Apple and a bullish outlook on Microsoft.\nApple is known for its popular consumer electronics such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook computer. The company also provides digital content via its App Store, Apple TV, and the Apple Card payment service. Microsoft is known for the Windows personal computer (PC) operating system, its Office 365 software suite, the Xbox video game console, and its Azure cloud computing platform.\nAAPL stock has risen 13% year-to-date and is up 22% over the last year. Microsoft\u2019s share price has gained 15% year-to-date and is up 32% over the past 12 months. These share price performances make Apple and Microsoft the laggards of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d technology stocks, with only Tesla (TSLA) performing worse. AAPL and MSFT stocks have also underperformed the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index that is up nearly 20% this year.\nThe valuation of Apple stock has a lot to do with my neutral view. Currently, AAPL is trading at 32 times future earnings estimates, which is less than the average price/earnings ratio of 44 among technology stocks. MSFT is also trading at a higher multiple of 36 times future earnings expectations. Additionally, Apple\u2019s stock has been largely trading sideways since June of this year. Because of this, a neutral view of the stock seems appropriate.\nThere are also concerns about iPhone sales to consider. When the company launched the iPhone 16 earlier in September, AAPL stock jumped. However, there have been reports about weak sales immediately following the newest iPhone\u2019s public unveiling. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that iPhone 16 demand is weak, dropping 12% compared to last year\u2019s iPhone 15 launch.\nKuo and other analysts have also expressed disappointment with the lack of new features on the iPhone 16. One of the most anticipated features, the company\u2019s AI application known as \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d won\u2019t launch until October of this year and is only in a beta format. Of course, Apple remains a strong company overall, and the current iPhone slump is likely temporary. However, patient investors might be able to buy the stock at a more attractive share price in the coming weeks if iPhone 16 sales disappoint.\nApple has a consensus rating of Moderate Buy among 32 Wall Street analysts. There are currently 23 Buy ratings, eight Hold ratings, and one Sell recommendation assigned to the stock. At $249.46, the average Apple stock price target implies upside potential of 15.39%.\nRead more analyst ratings on AAPL stock\nThere are many reasons to be bullish on MSFT stock. Like Apple, Microsoft is trading at a discount to the technology sector. Microsoft\u2019s stock has been in decline in recent months, falling 7% since early July. Some of that decline has been reversed on news that the company is raising its dividend by 10% and has approved a new $60 billion stock buyback program, boosting shareholder returns in the process. The company raised its dividend from $0.75 to $0.83 per share, payable on Dec. 12 of this year.\nMicrosoft also continues to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, capturing market share in both fast-growing segments. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform continues to grow at a brisk clip and is more all-encompassing than Apple\u2019s upcoming AI features for the iPhone.\nMicrosoft has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on the views of 30 Wall Street analysts. This is comprised of 29 Buy and one Hold rating on the company\u2019s stock. No Sell ratings have been assigned over the last three months. At $501.15, the average price target on Microsoft stock implies upside potential of 16.16%.\nRead more analyst ratings on MSFT stock\nApple and Microsoft could be long-term additions to any portfolio. However, Microsoft is preferred based on the company\u2019s leadership role in AI and future growth potential. The fact that the company raised its dividend payout to shareholders and initiated a $60 billion share repurchase program are other reasons to like MSFT stock. Apple, on the other hand, is struggling with weak iPhone demand and to clarify its AI strategy. As such, I remain bullish on MSFT stock and neutral on AAPL stock.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "At the recent launch event in Cupertino, Apple Intelligence debuted, marking a significant milestone for the tech giant.\nThe new iPhone series is Apple's first to fully integrate on-device artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, including the latest A18 series of chipsets. The rollout of Apple Intelligence features will begin in the US in English in October 2024, with plans to expand to additional countries in December and support more languages in 2025.\nWhile Apple was the last major OEM to incorporate AI into its devices, the company reiterated the same AI announcements made at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2024, without introducing anything new. Apple Intelligence will focus on language, image, and action generation, leveraging personal context and supported by various on-device generative models. These models will dynamically learn from and adapt to individual users.\nWhile Apple Intelligence will include both on-device generative models and cloud-based models, on-device processing is at the core of Apple's intelligence. Siri will play a central role in its intelligence efforts, offering conversational context, the ability to switch between text and voice, on-screen awareness, and the capability to perform actions within an app.\nGoogle bought the fight to Apple\u2019s backyard by aiming to integrate its Gemini AI models into 200 million Android devices by the end of 2024, prompting Apple to announce its own AI features.\nHowever, Apple's intelligence will initially be in beta mode on its latest models, with integration into the company's ecosystem occurring gradually over the years. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s latest innovation, its GenAI-based voice assistant, Gemini Live, is already accessible not only on the newly announced Pixel 9 series of smartphones, but also on an entire array of Android devices.\nThis upcoming iPhone cycle is crucial for Apple, as it aims to recover from lacklustresales, particularly in China, navigate regulatory scrutiny, and regain market cap lost to Microsoft and Nvidia due to their AI business. Apple will need to effectively promote its AI capabilities to succeed.\nThe integration of hearing aid functionality into earbuds has long been delayed in the industry. Apple's AirPods Pro 2 has become the first consumer device to incorporate hearing aid capability, making it accessible to users.\nMachine learning models facilitate the enhancement of the user's hearing based on a preliminary test. All Apple consumer devices owned by a user will integrate the hearing score obtained through the AirPods Pro 2, automatically adjusting their audio output accordingly. This exemplifies the seamless functionality within the company's ecosystem, which Android rivals will struggle to replicate.\nThe inclusion of hearing aid capability is likely to prompt competitors to adopt similar features swiftly. Apple's third-gen AirPods have experienced lacklustre sales, but the enhancement of the AirPods Pro represents a significant improvement. With an estimated 1.5 billion individuals worldwide experiencing varying degrees of hearing loss, the market potential for this product is substantial.\n\"Apple iPhone 16 has GenAI and hearing aid Airpods\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth.Apple expects the September quarter's (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.

        "Title": "Goldman Sachs\u2019 break up with Apple could cost $500 million to $4 billion, says analyst",
        "Author": "  Luisa Beltran ",
        "Text": "In 2019, Goldman Sachs made a splash by announcing what it called a \u201cgame-changing\u201d credit card with Apple. Five years later, the partnership appears to have fizzled and Apple is reportedly looking\u00a0 for a new card partner. If this goes forward, it will stick Goldman with a large bill and see the bank eliminate one of its three business lines entirely, according to a star analyst.\nFor context on Goldman's potential business pivot, it's helpful go back nearly ten years ago. That's when the firm, known for advising high net worth individuals and for its storied investment bank, decided to diversify. In 2016, it launched Marcus by Goldman Sachs, an online bank that offered personal loans and savings accounts. Goldman then added credit cards to its consumer mix, including partnerships with GM and Apple.\nThis was the bank\u2019s attempt to target the so-called \"mass affluent.\" Goldman, however, wasn\u2019t very good at going downstream and its consumer business, by August 2022, was still operating at a loss. Later that year, Goldman stepped back from consumer banking and reorganized.\nGoldman's response included combining asset and wealth management into one segment, and putting investment banking, global markets and trading into a second segment. (Goldman moved Marcus Invest and Marcus Deposits, which offers users high-yield savings accounts, to the asset and wealth management business.)\nThe bank\u2019s third unit, called platform solutions, housed transaction banking, Goldman\u2019s consumer partnerships (mainly credit cards with Apple and General Motors), as well as its specialty lender GreenSky. Stephanie Cohen, one of the most powerful women at Goldman and former cohead of its consumer and wealth management business, was put in charge of platform solutions. Cohen resigned from Goldman in March while the bank that month completed the sale of Greensky to a consortium led by Sixth Street.\nGoldman now appears to be exiting its card partnerships. In November, the investment bank reached an agreement with GM for them to begin a process to find a new issuer for the card, a person familiar with the situation said. GS is currently expected to transfer the GM card business to Barclays. Also in November, Apple decided to pull the plug on its credit card partnership with Goldman, according to the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 JPMorgan Chase is \u00a0in talks with Apple to take over the technology company\u2019s credit-card program, the WSJ reported this week.\nIf JPMorgan succeeds, the sale would make strategic sense and likely lead Goldman to eliminate platform solutions, according to a flash note this week from Mike Mayo, managing director and head of U.S. large-cap bank research at Wells Fargo Securities. Shutting down platform solutions would allow Goldman to fully focus on its two core businesses:\u00a0 GBM (global banking and markets); and AWM (asset and wealth management), Mayo said.\n\"To us, the reported sale in the WSJ (not confirmed) of the GS Apple cards portfolio ($17B) would be a strategic positive and help it move further \u2018back to the future,\u2019\u201d Mayo said. The issue, however, is the exit cost which if it exceeded $1 billion would seem negative, he wrote.\nMayo noted that the sale would reflect another \u201cblack eye\u201d for Goldman\u2019s failed consumer strategy, especially if the disposal cost is too high. There are some positives. If the investment bank exited both Apple and GM card partnerships before year end, it could remove cards from the 2025 federal stress test, Mayo said. \u201cOn balance, GS implies that cards are approaching breakeven, meaning a sale seems TBD (to be discussed),\u201d Mayo wrote in the note.\nAccording to the WSJ, Apple has held talks with several possible buyers for the card business including Synchrony Financial and Capital One, while its discussions with JPMorgan began earlier this year and have advanced in recent weeks. JPMorgan, however, doesn\u2019t want to pay the full-face value of the roughly $17 billion in outstanding balances in the Apple credit-card program, the story said.\nMayo said in the note that he\u2019s heard exit cost estimates from about $500 million to as high as $4 billion, with the analyst saying he would be in the low end of that range with a 3% to 10% discount to face value. \u201cIn our view, a payment from GS to JPM above $1 billion could be viewed negatively if GS really believes it is moving the portfolio toward breakeven, and in context of premiums often associated with card portfolio sales,\u201d Mayo said.\nThere won\u2019t be much left in platform solutions after the GM card is sold and Goldman offloads the seller finance portfolio.

        "Text": "Apple Watch delivers new sleep apnea notifications, and AirPods Pro 2 provide the world\u2019s first all-in-one hearing health experience including a clinical-grade, over-the-counter Hearing Aid feature\nCUPERTINO, Calif., September 09, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today unveiled breakthrough sleep and hearing health features coming to Apple Watch\u00ae and AirPods Pro\u00ae 2 that further deliver on Apple\u2019s commitment to health with experiences that enrich users\u2019 lives. These new features expand across products, bringing informative and powerful ways to support users in their sleep and hearing health for conditions that impact billions globally.\nUsing an innovative new Breathing Disturbances metric, sleep apnea notifications come to Apple Watch, adding to the many ways Apple Watch acts as an intelligent guardian for users\u2019 health. The sleep apnea notifications are expected to receive marketing authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other global health authorities soon, with availability this month in more than 150 countries and regions, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.1\nApple is providing the world\u2019s first all-in-one hearing health experience with AirPods Pro with active Hearing Protection2, a clinically validated Hearing Test feature, and an over-the-counter Hearing Aid feature. The first-of-its-kind software-based Hearing Aid feature helps make access to hearing assistance easier than ever at an approachable price point. The Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are expected to receive marketing authorization from global health authorities soon, and will be available this fall in more than 100 countries and regions, including the U.S., Germany, and Japan.3\n\"At Apple, we believe that technology can help you live a healthier life, and we\u2019re excited to enable incredible new health capabilities for serious conditions that affect billions of people around the world, while continuing to keep user data private,\" said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple\u2019s vice president of Health. \"With Apple Watch, we continue to offer our users the ability to uncover important health conditions with new sleep apnea notifications. And on AirPods Pro, powerful features put users\u2019 hearing health front and center, bringing new ways to help test for and receive assistance for hearing loss.\"\nA Powerful Way to Detect Signs of Sleep Apnea\nSleep is an important area of health as it impacts a person\u2019s overall physical and mental wellbeing. Sleep apnea is a prevalent disorder in which breathing momentarily stops during sleep, preventing the body from getting enough oxygen. The condition is estimated to impact more than 1 billion people worldwide, and in most cases, goes undiagnosed. If left untreated, it can have important health consequences over time, including increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiac issues.\nBreathing Disturbances is an innovative new Apple Watch metric that uses the accelerometer to detect small movements at the wrist associated with interruptions to normal respiratory patterns during sleep. Every 30 days, Apple Watch will analyze breathing disturbance data and notify users if it shows consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea so they can speak to their doctor about next steps, including potential diagnosis and treatment.\nBecause overall quality of sleep is important, Breathing Disturbances can also be used to assess restfulness of sleep. Breathing Disturbances can be influenced by alcohol, medications, sleep position, and more. Users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app, where they are classified as elevated or not elevated, and can be viewed over a one-month, six-month, or one-year period.\nFor more informed conversations with their healthcare providers, users can export a PDF that shows when sleep apnea may have occurred, three months of breathing disturbance data, and additional information. Educational articles are also available within the Health app to help users learn more about sleep apnea.\nThe sleep apnea notification algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning and an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. The feature was then validated in a clinical study \u2014 unprecedented in size for sleep apnea technology. In the clinical validation study, every participant identified by the algorithm had at least mild sleep apnea.\n\"Empowering consumers everywhere to have the ability to reliably identify the presence of abnormal breathing patterns during sleep can help uncover a woefully underdiagnosed and serious medical condition such as sleep apnea,\" said Sairam Parthasarathy, M.D., University of Arizona Health Sciences Center for Sleep, Circadian, and Neurosciences\u2019s professor and director in Tucson, Arizona. \"This is a major step forward in improving public health.\"\nSleep apnea notifications and Breathing Disturbances add to a range of sleep health features for Apple Watch users. In addition to monitoring important overnight health metrics like heart rate and respiratory rate, Apple Watch also helps users meet their sleep goals and track their sleep over time.\nThe World\u2019s First All-in-One Hearing Health Experience\nApproximately 1.5 billion people around the world are living with hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization. Research has also identified links between hearing loss and impact on a person\u2019s overall wellbeing, including dementia and social isolation.\nTo help users better understand their hearing health, Apple is introducing an end-to-end experience focused on prevention, awareness, and assistance.\nPrevention\nAccording to the Apple Hearing Study \u2014 a virtual longitudinal public research study conducted in collaboration with the University of Michigan School of Public Health and the World Health Organization \u2014 one in three people are regularly exposed to loud environmental noise levels that can impact their hearing. That can include common scenarios like taking the subway while commuting, mowing the lawn at home, attending a sporting event, and many more.\nIn order to help users prevent exposure to loud environmental noise while preserving the sound signature of what they\u2019re listening to, Hearing Protection comes to AirPods Pro. The ear tips help to provide passive noise reduction, while the H2 chip helps to actively reduce louder, more intermittent noise at 48,000 times per second. On by default across all listening modes, Hearing Protection is helpful in a variety of loud settings. Plus, with an all-new multiband high dynamic range algorithm, sounds at live events like concerts remain natural and vibrant.\nAwareness\nHearing loss often worsens gradually, leaving many people unaware that they may be living with the condition. Eighty percent of adults in the U.S. have not had their hearing checked in the last five years, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. To give users even more insights into hearing health, Apple is introducing an intuitive, clinical-grade hearing test based on the standard clinical approach called pure-tone audiometry that users can take themselves with their AirPods Pro and a compatible iPhone\u00ae or iPad\u00ae.\nUsers can take the convenient test in about five minutes from the comfort of their own home. The Hearing Test feature leverages advanced acoustic science and provides users with an interactive experience. When a user completes the test, they will see an easy-to-understand summary of their results, including a number representing hearing loss in each ear, a classification, and recommendations. The results, which include an audiogram, are stored privately and securely in the Health app, and can be shared with a healthcare provider to have more informed conversations.\nThe Hearing Test builds on learnings from the Apple Hearing Study and was developed using large-scale, real-world data. The feature was then validated against the clinical gold standard of pure-tone audiometry.\n\"Hearing health is a cornerstone of overall wellbeing. Protecting and preserving our hearing enhances our quality of life both in the short-term and long-term,\" said Rick Neitzel, University of Michigan School of Public Health\u2019s professor of Environmental Health Sciences and principal investigator of the Apple Hearing Study. \"I\u2019m thrilled Apple is introducing important tools to support people\u2019s hearing health. These tools will help people protect their ears from noise pollution, be aware of changes in their hearing over time, and have important conversations with their healthcare providers when they need additional support.\"\nAssistance\nLearning about hearing loss is a critical step to getting necessary assistance, which can often be challenging due to cost and access. Global research shows hearing loss often goes untreated. In fact, the Apple Hearing Study revealed that 75 percent of people diagnosed with hearing loss haven\u2019t received the assistive support that they need.\nAirPods Pro add an innovative over-the-counter Hearing Aid capability for users with mild to moderate hearing loss. Using the personalized hearing profile from the Hearing Test, this new feature seamlessly transforms AirPods Pro into a clinical-grade hearing aid. After setup, the feature enables personalized dynamic adjustments so users have the sounds around them boosted in real time. This helps them better engage in conversation, and keeps them connected to the people and environment around them. With the incredible audio quality of AirPods Pro, the user\u2019s personalized hearing profile is automatically applied to music, movies, games, and phone calls across their devices, without needing to adjust any settings. Users can also set up the Hearing Aid feature with an audiogram created by a hearing health professional.\nThe Hearing Aid feature was clinically validated in a controlled, randomized study that evaluated the perceived benefit of the feature and its custom settings compared to an audiologist-assisted setup.\nAfter taking the Hearing Test, the user\u2019s hearing profile can also help to personalize the AirPods Pro listening experience for even more people, including those with little to no hearing loss who can still benefit from specific adjustments at individual frequencies. To help provide the best listening experience, Media Assist is an all-new feature that helps boost certain parts of speech on a phone call or instruments within a soundtrack to help an even broader population.\nThese features build on the hearing health tools Apple currently offers its users. For example, with the Noise app, Apple Watch users can enable notifications for when environmental noise levels might affect their hearing health. On iPhone, users can set a headphone volume limit where they can turn on Reduce Loud Audio and drag a slider to a preferred decibel level. Apple also offers additional accessibility features for users to customize settings to meet their hearing needs.\n\"For decades, Apple has led the way in designing products for everyone and supporting users with a broad spectrum of hearing abilities,\" said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple\u2019s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. \"These features on AirPods Pro will make an impact on so many people by driving more awareness around hearing health and empowering individuals with new customizable tools to help them stay connected.\"\nAdditional features coming to Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad include:\nThe new Vitals app on Apple Watch gives users a way to check in on their daily health status and view key overnight health metrics, like heart rate and respiratory rate, and gain better context when it comes to their health.\nThe Health app offers additional support for pregnant users to reflect changes in their physical and mental health during this important time. Users can view the current gestational age and log symptoms in Cycle Tracking. Apple Watch users can also receive recommendations to review features like high heart rate notifications.\nTime spent journaling can be saved as mindful minutes in the Health app, and users can log their state of mind right in Journal.\nSince launching the Health app in 2014, Apple has introduced meaningful features that focus on 18 areas of health and fitness across Apple Watch, AirPods\u00ae, iPhone, and iPad. Apple is committed to empowering users on their health journey by building actionable features into the products they use every day that are grounded in science, and have privacy at the core.\nBuilt with Privacy at the Core\nPrivacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple\u2019s health features. When a user\u2019s device is locked with a passcode, Touch ID\u00ae, or Face ID\u00ae, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app \u2014 other than Medical ID \u2014 is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud\u00ae is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. When using iOS, iPadOS\u00ae, and watchOS\u00ae with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it.\nAvailability\nSome features may not be available in all regions or all languages, or with all makes and models.\nThe sleep apnea notifications are expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon, with availability this month in more than 150 countries and regions, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan. The feature will be supported on Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra\u00ae 2.\nThe Hearing Test and Aid features are expected to receive marketing authorization from global health authorities soon and will be supported with AirPods Pro 2 with the latest firmware when paired with a compatible iPhone or iPad, and will be available this fall in more than 100 countries and regions, including the U.S., Germany, and Japan.\nThe Hearing Protection feature is expected to be available in fall 2024 and will work with AirPods Pro 2 with the latest firmware when paired with a compatible iPhone, iPad, or Mac\u00ae running the latest operating system. The feature will be available in the U.S. and Canada.\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple\u2019s six software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Apple\u2019s more than 150,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n1 The sleep apnea notification feature is pending FDA clearance and is expected to be available later this month. The feature will be supported on Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. It is intended to detect signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea for people 18 years or older without a diagnosis of sleep apnea.\n2 The Hearing Protection feature works with AirPods Pro 2 with the latest firmware when paired with a compatible iPhone, iPad, or Mac running the latest operating system. The feature will be available in the U.S. and Canada. See support.apple.com/120850 for total attenuation and more information.\n3 The Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are expected to be available fall 2024. The Hearing Aid feature is pending marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities. The Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features will be supported on AirPods Pro 2 with the latest firmware paired with a compatible iPhone or iPad with iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 and later, and is intended for people 18 years or older.

        "Text": "By Deborah Mary Sophia\n(Reuters) - Shares of Apple fell nearly 3% on Monday after some analysts said delivery times for the new iPhone 16 Pro models indicated weaker-than-expected demand, possibly due to the delayed rollout of key artificial intelligence features.\nApple last week unveiled its long-awaited iPhone 16 series designed around its AI software, Apple Intelligence.\nEarly pre-order data from BofA Global Research revealed shorter global shipping times for the iPhone 16 Pro models compared with last year's 15 Pro models, as of Monday, three days after Apple started taking pre-orders.\nShip time on average for the iPhone 16 Pro currently stood at 14 days, lower than 24 days for the iPhone 15 Pro last year, the data showed, while the 19-day ship time for the iPhone 16 Pro Max compares with 32 days last year.\n\"The key factor is the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series ... the major selling point, Apple Intelligence, is not available at launch,\" Ming-Chi Kuo, a Taiwan-based analyst at TF International Securities, said in a blog post.\nApple Intelligence is set to arrive in the U.S. version of the English language in beta next month, and for other versions as late as next year, potentially keeping some customers on the fence about upgrading to the 16 series.\nFirst-weekend pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models were down 27% and 16%, respectively, according to Kuo.\n\"The U.S. is much weaker than last year, unless Apple massively increased supply allocation,\" Jefferies analysts said.\nTo be sure, some analysts also said that improving supply of the Pro models could have led to shorter shipping times this time around, after supply issues with a camera lens affected shipments for the iPhone 15 Pro Max last year.\n\"We are not concerned if pre-orders don't show meaningful growth,\" D.A.

        "Title": "Forget Apple: This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has minted a lot of millionaires since its initial public offering (IPO). The tech giant went public at a split-adjusted price of $0.10 in 1980, and it now trades at about $228 -- so a $10,000 investment back then would be worth about $22.8 million today. That's a life-changing gain, but Apple probably won't replicate those millionaire-making moves over the next few decades.\nApple is already the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.47 trillion, and its core growth engines are cooling off. It still depends on the aging iPhone for more than half of its revenue, its Mac and iPad product lines are also aging, and its higher-growth services business faces antitrust headwinds in the U.S. and Europe.\nApple is still a safe long-term investment, but investors looking for bigger gains should check out smaller companies that have churned out millionaire-making gains. One of those companies is the energy drink maker Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH), which saw its stock soar a whopping 18,680% over the past 10 years and would have turned a $10,000 investment into nearly $1.9 million. That same investment in Apple would have grown to about $90,000 over the past decade.\nYet Celsius only has a market cap of $8 billion. That makes it much smaller than its competitor Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST), which is worth $50 billion. So could Celsius generate even more millionaire-maker gains in the future?\nCelsius was founded in 2004 and went public in 2006. It tried to carve out a niche with sugar-free energy drinks that used all-natural ingredients like green tea, ginger, and various amino acids. It also claimed its drinks had \"thermogenic\" properties that help people burn more calories during workouts.\nAfter its public debut, Celsius rapidly expanded its capital-intensive direct-to-retail (DTR) and direct-store-delivery (DSD) distribution networks to lock in more retailers. It also launched costly marketing campaigns to promote its drinks.\nUnfortunately, those costly tactics didn't boost its sales fast enough to offset its widening losses. By 2010, it was aggressively cutting costs to stay afloat. It was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market that year and became an over-the-counter stock.\nThat delisting was a wake-up call for Celsius. It rebooted its business by replacing its entire board and C-suite, rebranding and repackaging its drinks, cutting loose unprofitable accounts like Costco Wholesale to boost its gross margin, and targeting health-oriented businesses like gyms and health supplement shops instead of supermarkets and superstores. When it finally returned to grocery stores, it shrewdly placed its drinks in the health and beauty aisles instead of the beverage section.\nThat turnaround led to Celsius' return to the Nasdaq in 2017. John Fieldly, who served as Celsius' CFO from 2012 to 2017, became its permanent CEO in 2018. Under Fieldly, Celsius maintained its momentum, attracted more health-oriented consumers, and became the third-largest energy drink in America after Red Bull and Monster Beverage.\nFrom 2013 to 2023, Celsius' revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61% from $11 million to $1.32 billion. Its gross margin expanded from 38% to 52%.\nMetric\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n1H 2024\nRevenue growth\n74%\n140%\n108%\n102%\n29%\nGross margin\n46.6%\n40.8%\n41.4%\n48%\n51.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n12.2%\n10.7%\n10.9%\n22.4%\n24.9%\nData source: Celsius Holdings.\nOver the past four and a half years, Celsius' revenue continued rising as its gross and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins expanded. Its new domestic distribution deal with PepsiCo, which started in August 2022, significantly boosted its sales in 2022 and 2023.\nThat growth was amplified by its rising sales on Amazon\u00a0and the expansion of its smaller international division. At the beginning of this year, Celsius signed a new distribution deal with the Japanese beverage giant Suntory\u00a0to sell its drinks in the U.K., Ireland, and Canada. PepsiCo, which acquired 8.5% of Celsius for $550 million two years ago, could also eventually expand its domestic distribution deal into more overseas markets.\nHowever, Celsius' growth cooled off in the first half of 2024 as it lapped the ramp-up period of its distribution deal with PepsiCo. It also struggled with some minor market share losses in the increasingly crowded U.S. energy drink market.\nBut from 2023 to 2026, analysts still expect Celsius' revenue to grow at a CAGR of 16% as Monster's revenue only rises at a CAGR of 8%. They expect Celsius' adjusted EBITDA to increase at a CAGR of 19% during those three years.\nThose growth rates are stable, and Celsius' stock looks reasonably valued at 4 times next year's sales and 18 times its adjusted EBITDA. But its business is gradually maturing, so it probably couldn't churn a fresh $10,000 investment into more than $1 million again over the next decade. That said, Celsius is still a solid growth stock that has a clear shot at outperforming its industry peers, the broader market, and even bigger blue chip stalwarts like Apple over the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Celsius wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Apple Watch Series 10 review: Bigger and brighter",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "The Apple (AAPL) Watch Series 10 brings some of the biggest changes to the company\u2019s popular smartwatch in years. It gets larger display options, a slimmer body, a faster-charging battery, and audio playback via its built-in speaker.\nThe 10th anniversary Apple Watch doesn\u2019t just get hardware updates, though. The Series 10 also introduces a bevy of software features via watchOS 11, including sleep apnea detection, the ability to pause fitness tracking when you\u2019re sick and don\u2019t want to feel guilty for not exercising, and a new Vitals app that tracks your health over time and tells you if important metrics like body temperature and respiration are off.\nIf you\u2019re still sporting an Apple Watch Series 6 or older, it\u2019s easy to recommend that you upgrade to the Series 10. But if you\u2019ve got an Apple Watch Series 7 or newer, it\u2019s more difficult to suggest making the leap to the Series 10. Your older watch will still get watchOS 11, and the difference between screen sizes is harder to discern unless you\u2019re looking at your old Apple Watch right next to the Series 10.\nThat said, if you\u2019re in the market for a new Apple Watch, the Series 10, with its hardware improvements, is the one to go with.\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 comes with two new size options: the $399 42-millimeter version and the $429 46mm model. That\u2019s 9% more screen real estate than the 41mm Apple Watch Series 7, 8, and 9 and 7% more than the 45mm Series 7, 8, and 9.\nI wear a 45mm Apple Watch Series 8 virtually every day, and it\u2019s pretty tough for me to spot the difference between the 46mm and 45mm displays. Yes, you get an extra line or so of text when reading text messages or news articles on the larger screens, but I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s enough to drop a few hundred bucks on a new watch.\nIt\u2019s a different story when you\u2019re coming from the older Apple Watches, though. Apple says the 42mm Series 10 has 30% more screen space than the 40mm version of the Series 4, 5, and 6, while the 46mm model offers a 25% larger display than the 44mm Series 4, 5, and 6. And if you\u2019re coming from the Series 2 or 3, you\u2019ll get between 75% and 65% more screen area. In those cases, you\u2019ll absolutely notice the larger display.\nApple says the Series 10 screens now feature wide-angle OLED technology, making them easier to see at an angle, which is generally how people look at their watches. The Series 10 body is also 1mm thinner than the Series 7, 8, and 9 and offers a more rounded design than its predecessors. The result is a watch that sits more comfortably on your wrist.\nThere\u2019s also a new speaker on the side that lets you play music from your wrist. It\u2019s not going to sound as good as it would coming out of your iPhone or AirPods, but it gets the job done if you\u2019re in a relatively quiet space and need some tunes. Don\u2019t try using it as your shower speaker, though: You won\u2019t be able to hear it.\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 still gets the same 18 hours of battery life as last year\u2019s model, but Apple says it\u2019s refined the charging system so that you\u2019ll now get up to 8 hours of use from just 15 minutes of charge time and fill 80% of the battery in 30 minutes. That makes it far easier to use the Apple Watch to track your sleep at night since you can now drop it on the charger while you get ready in the morning and have plenty of juice to power it throughout the day.\nIn my experience, the Apple Watch Series 10's battery has lasted all day, overnight while tracking my sleep, and well into the next day before I needed to recharge it.\nApple\u2019s watchOS 11, the latest version of the operating system that powers the Apple Watch line, includes a host of new features for the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer as well as the Ultra, Ultra 2, and second-generation Apple Watch SE.\nThe new Vitals app records your health stats while you sleep to provide you with an ongoing record of your overall general wellness. That includes your heart and respiratory rates, wrist temperature, and sleep duration.\nThe idea is to give you a sense of what\u2019s normal for your body and provide you with a better understanding of what impacts your health and fitness, whether that\u2019s being sick or having a few too many adult beverages during happy hour.\nApple has also added a Training Load feature that logs your overall effort while working out. Over time, you can see if you\u2019re pushing yourself harder or going too easy while exercising and adjust your workouts appropriately. I\u2019ve been using Training Load for the past week and appreciate the ability to see when I\u2019ve been working out too hard and when I\u2019ve needed to step it up.\nWatchOS 11 also includes a new Check In option that lets you send an alert to your close contacts when you finish a workout like an outdoor run. I was out for a run a few months back and was hit by a car, and while I was able to call my wife right away, Check In would have been incredibly helpful if I hadn't been. If she didn\u2019t get a Check In alert in the normal time it usually takes for me to complete my run, she could have looked up my location in the Find My app to see what was going on.\nApple is also rolling out a new sleep apnea detection function for the Apple Watch. The feature tracks micro-movements using the watch\u2019s accelerometer to determine if you\u2019re having trouble breathing. Every 30 days the software will analyze your data to determine if you\u2019re experiencing sleep disturbances and alert you if you may be at risk of sleep apnea. You can then take that data to your doctor to further discuss the matter.\nIt took years of me snoring at night before I finally went to get a sleep test to determine that I had sleep apnea. But if my watch had been telling me I had a potential problem, I likely would have gone out and gotten one sooner. That said, if you\u2019re already being treated for the disorder like me, this feature isn\u2019t for you.\nI\u2019m a big fan of the Apple Watch, partly because I like getting notifications without having to check my phone all the time and because I love tracking my fitness activity. With its updated hardware and improved software, the Apple Watch Series 10 is the company\u2019s best iteration of its popular wearable yet.\nThat said, it\u2019s not exactly necessary to upgrade if you\u2019re already rocking a Series 8 or newer. You\u2019ve still got a great watch that will easily run watchOS 11. If you\u2019ve got an older model, however, now is the time to consider making the jump to the latest model, especially if you\u2019re coming from a Series 6 or older.\nNow I\u2019m off to test out the watch\u2019s sleep tracking feature a little more.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks.\u00a0Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nStanley Druckenmiller\u00a0is one of the few billionaires who have been bullish on the AI megatrends right from the start. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019d buy just anything AI the market is buying. After making huge profits from his bullish bet on Jensen Huang\u2019s AI chips empire, he started cashing out of the company in the first quarter and by the end of the June quarter, his stake in the company was left at just over 200,000 shares.\nBack in May, Druckenmiller explained why he\u2019s selling the hottest AI stock, saying he\u2019s had a \u201chell of a run\u201d and he now \u201cjust needs a break.\u201d\nHowever, the billionaire said at the time that AI remains underhyped in the long term. Stanley Druckenmiller compared the internet revolution with the current AI boom, saying AI could \u201crhythm\u201d with the internet and the real payoffs will come 4-5 years from now on. The Duquesne Capital founder, who closed his fund for outside investors and turned it into a family officer in 2011, said that the \u201cincremental payoff\u201d of AI investments is coming by the \u201cday.\u201d\nDuring the second quarter, Druckenmiller shook up his portfolio to buy and sell several famous as well as under-the-radar AI stocks. In this article, we will take a look at some of those.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller\u2019s Stake Value: $5,139,000 (-79% From the First Quarter)\nBen Reitzes, Melius Research\u2019s head of technology research, said while talking to CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in a \u201cgenerational\u201d upgrade cycle.\n\u201cFirst, the installed base of phones is old. So, we have that going for us. Then, Apple Intelligence only works on the newer phones.\u201d\nThe analyst said that he\u2019s very \u201cupbeat\u201d on Apple shares. Asked about Buffett selling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, he said he might have \u201cother motivations.\u201d\nBen Reitzes said that he believes Apple\u2019s upgrade cycle would peak in 2026 and Wall Street expectations for Apple are easily beatable.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a new bull: billionaire Dan Loeb. The founder of the New York-based hedge fund Third Point said in a latest letter to investors that Apple has a significant upside potential due to AI.\n\u201cWe believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced \u2018Apple Intelligence\u2019 suite of AI-enabled smartphone features \u2013 the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant \u2013 will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple\u2019s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First,\u00a0 iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple\u2019s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer focused AI apps such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT (with which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple\u2019s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage.\u201d\nLoeb reiterated the bull case that many other Wall Street analysts have made. This case assumes that millions of people will upgrade their iPhones because they\u2019d want to use AI-powered new models of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship device.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a great stock to own since late September 2019. During that five-year stretch, its shares produced a 328% total return. This gain absolutely trounces the broader S&P 500.\nThe momentum has continued this year, as Apple is up 18% (as of Sept. 27). But investors care about what the future holds. Where will this consumer discretionary stock be in five years?\nApple's business model has shifted in the past several years. To be more specific, services have become a bigger contributor to financial success. Offerings like iCloud, Pay, TV+, and the App Store, among others, are a growth engine, posting 14% sales growth in the latest fiscal quarter (Q3 2024, ended June 29).\nEven better, services boast a stellar gross margin of 74%. And they provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for Apple, which is exactly what shareholders want.\nHowever, this remains a hardware company at its core. Sales of physical products represented 72% of overall revenue in Q3. These hardware devices are still key to Apple's success. The iPhone in particular accounted for 46% of Apple's sales last quarter.\nAlthough services are becoming more important, I think five years from now, products, especially the iPhone, will still be the main aspect of the company's financial performance. Consequently, the business will most likely look very similar to how it does today.\nBut artificial intelligence (AI) is set to feature more prominently. Apple just released its 16th lineup of iPhones. And these newer devices will be compatible with Apple Intelligence, the company's new AI-powered software that can help users summarize text, boost their writing skills, and edit photos. The hope is that AI can spur greater demand for new iPhone sales, but this hasn't been the case so far.\nApple might have been a wildly successful investment in the past five years. But I don't believe this will be true over the next five.\nThe reason I think this way partly has to do with the valuation. If you want to buy Apple shares, you'll pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.7. On the one hand, it's easy to argue that such a dominant business deserves a high multiple. After all, Apple possesses one of the world's strongest brands, is incredibly profitable, and is even a top holding for Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway.\nHowever, that P/E ratio is 22% higher than the stock's trailing five-year average. Expectations have outgrown the underlying fundamentals. Paying a premium valuation would make sense only if investors believed that Apple was going to register outsize growth in the years ahead. It's hard to be optimistic in this regard, though.\nCompared to five or 10 years ago, Apple is now a very mature enterprise. There are more than 2.2 billion active devices scattered across the globe. While this figure inches higher each quarter, there are simply fewer opportunities to get these products into more hands, especially the iPhone. Revenue is slated to increase at just a 5.8% yearly rate between fiscal 2023 and 2026.\nAnd even though the iPhone is arguably the single most successful product of all time, newer updates aren't as revolutionary as they once were. This doesn't incentivize consumers to switch to the newest model, which can pressure revenue growth. When it comes to AI, the jury is still out on whether or not people even want or need these new features. It could all prove to be hype.\nThere's a very good chance that the stock could underperform the broader S&P 500 over the next five years. And that's why I don't own shares.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 774% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 169% for the S&P 500.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 30, 2024\nNeil Patel and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "Text": "\nEarly pre-order data for the iPhone 16 looks disappointing when compared to last year's iPhone 15 launch, several analysts said Monday.\nThe various models of the new smartphone have shorter average delivery times across a number of key markets, suggesting a combination of lower sales volume and higher supply.\nSales may be trending towards the higher-priced Pro and Pro Max models, which could offset lower sales volume.\n\nEarly Wall Street feedback on demand for Apple's newest iPhone suggests the newest models might not be flying off the shelves.\nAnalyzing delivery lead times and whether models of the iPhone 16 will be available in stores on Friday as scheduled, several analysts said Monday that early indications appear disappointing for Apple's (AAPL) latest smartphone.\nAnalysts from J.P. Morgan, Jefferies, Barclays, and Bank of America on Monday said that iPhone 16 pre-orders, which started Friday, are seeing shorter estimated delivery times than last year's new iPhone 15s. That's likely due to factors including both higher U.S. supply and lower demand, the analysts said.\nThe faster delivery times suggest lower sales volume, but Jefferies analysts said that sales may be shifting toward the more expensive Pro and Pro Max models, which could help offset lower overall volume.\nThe analysts also said their data showed wider availability of the Pro and Pro Max models in several U.S. cities when compared to last year.\n\u201cWe cannot rule out that Apple did allocate more supply to the US since Apple Intelligence will be available first there, but it will unlikely be massively more since it still needs to meet usually strong initial demand in other major markets, [including] China,\" Jefferies analysts wrote. \"Even so, it still suggests Apple has overestimated demand in the US for its AI features.

        "Title": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): \u2018The Weekend\u2019s Pre-orders For The New iPhone 16 Were Anemic\u2019 According to Firms",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks You Can\u2019t Ignore.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's top stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current divide between tech stocks and other sectors, highlighting their tendency to move in opposite directions. For example, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 228 points and the S&P 500 went up by 0.13%, the NASDAQ, which is heavily influenced by tech stocks, dropped by 0.52%. Cramer thinks it's because there isn\u2019t enough new money flowing into the market.\n\"How did we get to this bizarre dichotomy between tech stocks and pretty much everything else, where the two groups now almost always seem to move in opposite directions? Take today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points, the S&P advanced 0.13%, but the NASDAQ\u2014with all that tech in it\u2014dropped a bomb. Yes, it fell 0.52%. How could there be such a schism?\"\nAs a result, large institutions need to move their investments between sectors since they can\u2019t invest in both at once. This shift is due to market mechanics rather than fundamental news. When stocks are already doing well, it\u2019s difficult to attract new investment, especially when safer options provide attractive returns. Therefore, either tech stocks or other sectors will perform well, but not both simultaneously.\n\"It\u2019s because there\u2019s not enough money coming in from the sidelines, so these big institutions have to swap out of one group if they want to buy stock in another. Yet this action has nothing to do with fundamentals; it\u2019s not about the news, it\u2019s about pure market mechanics. When stocks are already red hot, it\u2019s hard to attract new capital from the sidelines, especially when you can get a cozy 4% return for doing nothing. So, either tech wins or everything else wins, but there\u2019s not enough cash for both of them to win at the same time.\"\nCramer notes that this situation results in distinct winners and losers, rather than a range of performance on a positive day. This is occurring amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in their upcoming meeting. Cramer also notes that, despite his usual reluctance to speculate on the Fed\u2019s decisions, recent market movements have been swayed by expectations of rate cuts. For example, when The Wall Street Journal indicated the Fed might choose a 50 basis point reduction, there was a notable shift towards cyclical stocks, particularly those related to housing. This shift, along with other positive news, contributed to the market's best week of the year.\n\"What happens? We get winners and losers\u2014not big winners and smaller winners, as you would normally expect on an up day like today. This is all against the backdrop of the big question: will the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points or 50 when it meets on Wednesday?\nThis leads me to this newfound great divide between tech and non-tech, because that\u2019s how this market seems to be trading. It\u2019s a big reason why I\u2019m out here in Silicon Valley this week. Today, we saw a market that doesn\u2019t believe in AI, or tech in general for that matter. It\u2019s a market that believes a 50-basis-point rate cut will shift money from semiconductors to housing and anything housing-related, and people want to get ahead of that.\"\nJim Cramer noted that Monday\u2019s market saw a wide range of winners. Healthcare stocks, retailers, and consumer packaged goods companies all did well, and even oil stocks, which have been lagging, are rebounding. This is unusual because typically when cyclical stocks rise, sectors like healthcare and consumer products would drop. Cramer explains this trend as part of a broader market shift he calls \"ABT,\" or \"anything but tech.\" Essentially, today's market is focusing on sectors outside of technology.\n\"Today, the winners broadened out. The healthcare stocks got jiggy, retailers worked, and consumer packaged goods companies outperformed. Even the much-maligned oils are rallying. It\u2019s crazy\u2014healthcare and consumer products should be selling off when cyclicals rally, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening because it\u2019s *ABT*. No, I\u2019m not talking about the symbol for Abbott Labs. ABT means \u201canything but tech,\u201d and that\u2019s what today\u2019s market was about.\nThe implications are pretty stark, folks. Market commentators call this a rotation, but that understates what\u2019s really happening here because the move is so vicious and devoid of realism. The market\u2019s action is dictating what we do. For example, we know that the principal beneficiaries of rate cuts are the housing stocks, which rallied again today. This is the second day these stocks jumped as rates continue to plummet. But today, day two, was zero-sum.\"\nTech stocks also experienced notable gains because of key events. For example, Larry Ellison from Oracle reported strong earnings and emphasized the need for many additional data centers.\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, where he discussed various stocks. We have selected the ten most notable companies he mentioned and ranked them based on their ownership levels by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer explained that money flowed out of stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) after reports from several firms suggested weak pre-orders for the new iPhone 16. This news led to a significant sell-off in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) related stocks.\n\"The money poured out of stocks like Apple on word from a few firms that the weekend's pre-orders for the new iPhone 16 were anemic (more on that later). All you need to know is that it caused an eruption of selling in anything connected to Apple.\"\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) presents a strong investment case due to several key factors. The recent introduction of the iPhone 16, which includes advanced AI features, is expected to spark a major upgrade cycle, with analysts forecasting sales of up to 240 million units due to high pent-up demand.\nAdditionally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s focus on integrating AI across its entire product range, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, aims to enhance user experiences and create new revenue opportunities. Combined with impressive growth in its services sector and strong profit margins, these factors contribute to a favorable long-term outlook for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), with analysts predicting a potential price increase of about 25%.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of almost $3.3 trillion. The popularity of the company's iPhones played a central role in helping the tech giant reach this position. So it was not surprising to see Apple stock drop in price after TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo pointed out that the demand for the company's latest iPhones is not as strong as expected.\nKuo estimates that pre-orders of Apple's latest iPhone 16 models are down nearly 13% year over year, with the first weekend's sales estimated to come in at 37 million units. Apple touted this latest model as a significant change over previous iPhones because it's the first to be artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled. But some doubters wonder if it was introduced too late. Samsung leads the generative AI smartphone market with a share of 36%, according to industry estimates, while Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi and Huawei control 22% and 13% share of this market, respectively.\nKuo's report of lower pre-orders offers potential evidence that the doubters are right and it's a cause for concern. However, a closer look at the reasons behind the reportedly poor start of the iPhone 16 lineup indicates that investors shouldn't panic. It won't be surprising to see Apple's AI-enabled iPhones gradually gain sales momentum and help the stock deliver healthy gains over the next three years.\nThe generative AI smartphone is in its early phases of growth, which is why investors shouldn't start panicking based on just one weekend of sales data of Apple's latest iPhones. According to market research firm IDC, shipments of generative AI smartphones are expected to hit 234 million units in 2024, an increase of a whopping 364% from last year.\nEven then, generative AI smartphones are forecast to account for 19% of the global smartphone market this year, suggesting that their sales could keep growing at a tremendous pace in the coming years. IDC predicts that the generative AI smartphone market could clock a compound annual growth rate of 78% between 2024 and 2028, with shipments hitting 912 million units at the end of the forecast period. So it isn't too late for Apple yet to make a dent in the generative AI smartphone market and witness an acceleration in growth in the future.\nAnother reason why the new iPhones are likely to get off to a slow start is that they won't be running Apple Intelligence right out of the box. Apple's suite of generative AI features will be first made available in U.S. English by way of a software update next month. Other English-speaking countries such as the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa will join the list in December, while other languages such as French, Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese are likely to get Apple Intelligence next year.\nAs such, it is not surprising to see why customers may not be rushing to purchase the latest iPhone models at launch. However, the long-term opportunity for the company within the generative AI smartphone market remains intact, especially considering a sizable installed base of users in an upgrade window.\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, there are 50 million iPhone 12 models that are currently in an upgrade window in the U.S. alone. Meanwhile, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush estimates that around 300 million iPhones have not been upgraded in over four years. So, Apple could be sitting on a massive upgrade cycle that could help drive sales of the iPhone 16 and subsequent AI-enabled models.\nThat's why investors would do well to look at the bigger picture instead of relying on one week of sales data. This is also the reason why analysts expect Apple's growth to accelerate over the next couple of fiscal years.\nApple is expected to generate just over $390 billion in revenue in the current fiscal year, which would be an improvement of less than 2% from its top line in fiscal 2023. However, the estimate for fiscal 2025, which will begin next month, suggests that the company's revenue is on track to increase by almost 8%. The estimate for fiscal 2026 suggests that Apple is on track to maintain its revenue growth momentum.\nThe improvement in Apple's top line is set to filter down to its bottom line as well. The company reported $6.13 per share in earnings in fiscal 2023, and the chart shows that its bottom line is on track to improve by 9% in fiscal 2024. However, the growth rate is set to improve over the next couple of years.\nAssuming Apple's earnings indeed jump to $8.39 per share after three years, and it trades at 33 times earnings at that time (in line with its current earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $277. That would be a 28% increase from current levels.\nHowever, Apple stock could deliver stronger gains if the market decides to reward the company's AI-powered growth with a richer earnings multiple, especially considering that it is currently trading at a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average earnings multiple of 44.\nSo, Apple investors shouldn't miss the forest for the trees, as the generative AI smartphone has a lot of room for growth, and the company already has a huge installed base of users that should help it start capitalizing on this lucrative opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) announced updates to its entire Apple Watch lineup during its annual iPhone event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters on Monday. The changes include a new Apple Watch Series 10 and updates to its Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nThe Apple Watch Series 10, which starts at $399, gets the biggest changes of the lot, with Apple increasing the display size of the 41-millimeter model to 42 mm and the previous 45-mm edition to 46 mm. The watches also sport slimmer casings than their predecessors.\nThe displays offer up to 30% more screen area than the Apple Watch Series 6, giving users space to view more text and making it easier to type messages, enter passcodes, and check emails.\nThe Apple Watch also gets rounded corners, giving it a more streamlined look, and Apple's first-ever wide-angle OLED display that's designed to look 40% brighter when viewed at an angle. It also updates every second rather than once a minute.\nDespite its larger, brighter displays, Apple says the Apple Watch is its thinnest smartwatch yet. What's more, it features a new speaker that you can finally use to play audio.\nOn the battery front, Apple says the Apple Watch can charge to 80% in just 30 minutes. So, if you use the watch to track your sleep, you can drop it onto its charger and top it off before heading out the door for the day.\nInside, the Apple Watch is powered by Apple's new S10 chip, which enables things like on-board Siri, Crash Detection, and Double Tap. Apple says the Series 10 also uses new neural networks for improved phone calls.\nHealth tracking features are a major selling point for the Apple Watch, and Apple is expanding on that with a new sleep apnea detection function that will alert users if it determines they are exhibiting signs of a sleep disorder and tell them they should visit a doctor. I've got sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine every night, so I'll be able to tell how well the watch is able to pick up the condition.\nThe detection algorithm uses machine learning and clinic-grade sleep apnea tests. Apple says it expects clearance from the FDA soon, and it will be available in more than 150 regions. The feature is also coming to the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nOn fitness tracking, Apple says the Series 10 gets a new depth detection function for diving and snorkeling. The company is also introducing tides information as part of watchOS 11 to provide users with information before they hit the beach. There's also improved tracking for paddling on the water.\nThe $799 Apple Watch Ultra 2 doesn't get much in terms of physical updates, though Apple is adding a new satin black finish. The company is positioning the Ultra 2 as the ultimate sports watch in Apple's portfolio, with Apple saying it's great for running, biking, swimming, golfing, and skiing.\nSince its debut 10 years ago, the Apple Watch line has become one of Apple's most popular iPhone accessories and one of the bestselling smartwatches in the world. Apple doesn't provide overall Apple Watch revenue and instead counts it as part of its Wearables, Home, and Accessories business.\nIn its most recent quarter, the segment brought in $8 billion, down from $8.2 billion in the same quarter last year. Across all of 2023, Apple's Wearables business accounted for $39.8 billion of the company's $383 billion in sales. That was more than its Mac and iPad segments but well below its iPhone business, which brought in $200 billion for the year.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Samantha Delouya, CNN ",
        "Text": "During its glossy product announcement event on Tuesday, Apple unveiled a new role for its latest AirPods Pro model: medical device. The company said the wireless headphones will double as clinical-grade over-the-counter hearing aids for those who need them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re adding this groundbreaking capability to help more than 1 billion people living with mild to moderate hearing loss,\u201d said Sumbul Ahmad Desai, Apple\u2019s vice president of health.\nApple said its hearing aid feature will boost frequencies \u201cso sounds are clearer and more vibrant to your ears.\u201d The company also said the feature will use \u201cmachine learning to make real-time adjustments as you go about your day.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized Apple\u2019s hearing aid feature. Apple said the feature would become available to AirPods Pro 2 owners this fall through a software update in over 100 countries, including the United States, Germany, and Japan.\nPrescription hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars. At $249, Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro 2 may be significantly cheaper and more accessible for those who have suffered hearing loss \u2014 but they won\u2019t work for everyone. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\nClose to 30 million US adults have some degree of hearing loss, but only about one-fifth of those people seek assistance for the issue, according to the FDA.\nFor people with untreated hearing loss,\u00a0using hearing aids can reduce the\u00a0rate\u00a0of cognitive decline and\u00a0may lower the risk of\u00a0depression, according to the FDA.\u00a0However,\u00a0experts\u00a0have\u00a0said\u00a0that\u00a0the high cost of doctor visits and hearing aids kept some from seeking treatment.\nApple\u2019s announcement comes two years after the FDA greenlit the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids. Since then, adults with mild to moderate hearing loss have been able to buy hearing aids directly from stores or manufacturers online without the help of a doctor.\nTo access the new hearing aid feature, AirPods Pro 2 users will have to take a test that will analyze their hearing loss by playing a series of tones.\n\u201cAfter you take a hearing test, your AirPods Pro are transformed into a personalized hearing aid, boosting specific sounds you need in real-time, like parts of speech or elements within your environment,\u201d said Desai.\nBut over-the-counter hearing aids\u00a0like these\u00a0aren\u2019t always the solution\u00a0for hearing loss. The FDA still requires people under 18 years old to purchase hearing aids by prescription. Over-the-counter hearing aids, such as Apple\u2019s offering,\u00a0also\u00a0are not a treatment for \u201csevere or profound\u201d hearing loss, according to the FDA. Those with significant hearing loss should still consult a\u00a0health care professional.\n\u201cToday\u2019s marketing authorization of an over-the-counter hearing aid software on a widely used consumer audio product is another step that advances the availability, accessibility and acceptability of hearing support for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss,\u201d said Michelle Tarver, acting director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health in a statement on Thursday.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Apple has dabbled in the\u00a0health care\u00a0space. Apple\u2019s Watch can\u00a0detect irregular heart rhythms\u00a0associated with\u00a0atrial fibrillation or\u00a0AFib, which can lead to blood clots, stroke and\u00a0heart failure,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Heart Association.\nOn Tuesday, Apple announced that its latest Apple Watch 10 can also alert users to sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing stops and starts repeatedly during sleep.\nBarbara Kelley, the executive director of Hearing Loss Association of America, said she had hoped for an announcement like Apple\u2019s after the FDA opened up the market to over-the-counter offerings two years ago.\n\u201cThis is what we wanted in the market, to see technology innovation to really get people to pay attention to their hearing health,\u201d Kelley said.\nKelley said she hoped Apple\u2019s new product would encourage more people to address hearing loss.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a stigma attached to hearing loss coming with aging,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cBut my goodness, I see elementary school kids with these AirPods in their ears. If it can also serve as a hearing aid, I think that\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\nApple\u2019s announcement was applauded by some hearing aid users on social media, as well. But many noted one clear advantage traditional hearing aids have over AirPods: Hearing aids have battery life measured in days, not hours.\n\u201cAs someone who is hearing impaired, this was the most exciting thing from today\u2019s event,\u201d one Reddit user posted Tuesday. \u201cI am hoping that they can make battery life better than 3-6 hours. It\u2019d be nice to get 8 hours.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other buzzing stocks.\nSeptember and October tend to be the most volatile months for the stock market, particularly during election years. This was recently discussed by Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, who expects the volatility to stay until the end of October.\nStovall says that while the S&P 500 recovered all its 2022 bear market losses by January this year, and reached 22 new all-time highs by March, equities have digested some of these gains and experienced sector rotation away from 2023 high flyers into more defensive areas of the market. Hence, the year started great, but the markets are declining once again. The S&P 500\u2019s average volatility in October 2023 was 35% higher than the average for the remaining 11 months of the year.\nInvestors are concerned that the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates while inflation remains sticky and GDP growth begins to cool. Stovall expects three 25-basis point cuts this year, followed by another four in 2025. He thinks that while a 50 basis point cut is rare since it only ever happened twice, in 2001 and then 2007, it is still not unlikely given that the economy is worse than expected.\nAccording to Stovall, investors need to be prepared for this increased volatility as the market digests the Fed\u2019s actions and the potential impact on the economy. The market will likely remain uncertain until the Fed can find the right balance between slowing down the economy and stopping inflation, without causing a recession.\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, is of a similar idea, suggesting that investors should remain cautious over the next 8 weeks, due to both uncertainty surrounding elections and the September cuts. He says that the stock market may experience a 7-10% pullback, considering there have already been two 7% corrections this year.\nLee thinks at least a 5% pullback can be anticipated, but if it\u2019s only 1-2%, then that\u2019s negligible. But despite the recommended caution for the 8 weeks starting September, he thinks the volatility does not translate into a tough full-year. He views this pullback as a buying opportunity, believing that the market has not yet reached its peak for 2024.\nAs Lee encourages investors to be ready to buy the dip, we are here with a list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.\nNote: All price/volume data is as of September 6.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nVolume: 43.617 million\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 63.905 million\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm, known as the company behind iPhones. These iPhones alone make up 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. It also offers services including iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nIn FQ3 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI, integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models.\nIt plans to launch the next generation of the iPhone lineup in September. This annual event is receiving a lot of attention because the company is expected to unveil new AI features for these phones. Lagging iPhone sales in recent years have slowed the revenue growth for the company, and this AI upgrade is expected to change its growth outlook.\u00a0However, even more advanced AI features will not roll out earlier than 2025.\nOn August 29, 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is eyeing a major investment in OpenAI, along with NVIDIA, as part of a funding round led by Thrive Capital that would value OpenAI at $100 billion.\nThe revenue for this fiscal quarter was up 4.87% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also a great choice for ESG investors, given its commitment to labor rights, environmental responsibility, and ethical business practices. It has reduced its overall greenhouse gas emissions by over 55% since 2015, marking progress toward its 2030 goal of achieving carbon neutrality across its entire value chain.\nCurrently, 184 hedge funds are long in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0has the highest stake in the company, with a position of $84,248,000,000.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cInvestors were reminded of the strength of the\u00a0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list the most buzzing stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Can Apple's New Product Updates Revive Sales and Investor Confidence?",
        "Author": "  Eric Reed ",
        "Text": "On Monday, September 9, Apple hosted fans, developers and reporters at its Cupertino headquarters.\nThe event was a series of product announcements for the coming year, led by CEO Tim Cook. Following up on the company\u2019s annual WorldWide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June, Apple is ready to start releasing the next iteration of several major product lines, many based around Apple\u2019s latest investments in artificial intelligence.\nThe question is whether this will excite and inspire Apple\u2019s loyal user base. It\u2019s a question Apple increasingly wants to answer in the face of popular, but legacy, product lines and strong, but dipping sales worldwide.\nFor news that may impact Apple and other potential investments, sign up for the Market Minute newsletter.\nSales are the issue.\nA criticism that Apple has faced in recent years has focused on quarterly sales growth. In recent years, Apple\u2019s device sales have slowed significantly compared with five or 10 years ago. Between 2023 and 2024 alone, the company reported a drop in sales across just about every category, with a particularly large 10% dip in the iPhone sales that drive much of Apple\u2019s revenue.\nMuch of this is generally attributed to a concept called \u201ccommoditization.\u201d\u00a0This occurs when a technology moves from its cutting-edge, high development phase and shifts towards a stable, well-established format. Think, for example, of how early PCs moved from changing the world in 1990 to desktop appliances in 2024, or the current transition of electric cars from futuristic marvels to municipal fleet vehicles.\nWhile an opportunity for new entrants and startups, for established companies like Apple commoditization can be a problem.\nIn a technology\u2019s early, high-development years, customers have a strong incentive to upgrade their devices regularly. Each new generation of an early technology fixes problems, introduces features, and generally improves the experience overall as developers continue innovating. This can drive strong sales, since a company can sell to their existing customer base over and over again.\nHowever, over time, developers figure their technology out and that rate of innovation significantly slows. Devices become reliable, effective and (critically) full-featured. Each generation may get a little faster and a little better, but a typical customer will see few limits or gaps in older devices. Once this commoditization stage sets in sales will generally dip, because existing customers will have less reason to upgrade on a regular basis. Sales growth will then rely increasingly on new customers, a significantly more difficult and expensive market to reach.\nMarket analysts have spent years reviewing the commodity arc for the iPhone.\u00a0By now, however, most agree that it has long since arrived. The iPhone 15 is certainly better than the iPhone 12, say, but for an ordinary user the older phone offers few (if any) limitations.\nSign up for the Market Minute newsletter for economic and financial news that may impact Apple and the wider stock market.\nIn its September presentation, Apple presented a series of products that it hopes will change all that. The most significant are:\nPerhaps best described as Apple\u2019s AiPhone, the iPhone 16 is Apple\u2019s latest generation of smartphone. This, in and of itself, is nothing new. Apple has released a new generation of iPhone just about every year since the first launch in 2007. This year\u2019s phone offers the now-standard set of improvements, promising faster processing, better battery life, improved screen and camera performance, and related iterative improvements.\nThe big difference is artificial intelligence.\nApple has announced its own AI product called Apple Intelligence, a software feature that it plans to thoroughly integrate in all its devices going forward. The iPhone 16, and in particular the iPhone 16 Pro, will be the first devices to use this. According to Apple, this is because the iPhone 16 is the first phone powerful enough to run AI locally, as opposed to most devices which connect to a remote server running the AI.\nAs advertised, Apple Intelligence will be a full-platform upgrade, touching on just about every aspect of the user experience. Writing and transcribing abilities will help you draft messages and create transcripts of your recordings. Onboard agents will help you sort alerts and e-mails by priority. Siri will function as a conversational agent, answering questions and accessing on- and off-phone data on command. Image software can analyze the world through your camera, letting you point at something and ask Siri \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d, and can also improve your photography through digital touchups.\nAgain, at least this is how the phone will work as advertised.\nIt\u2019s impossible to say exactly how or how well these products will work. Nor is it easy to say exactly how users will react to a phone that wants to draft their love notes and take their pictures for them.\u00a0This is all first-generation software, and AI has become known for its limits as much as its miracles. Still, Apple is presenting the new iPhone as next-kin to a Star Trek communicator, conversational computing at the touch of a button.\nIn addition to the iPhone, Apple is promising a significant leap in its AirPods product line. The company phased out its corded earbuds in favor of these wireless devices several years ago.\nThe new AirPods come with a bundle of features. The AirPods 4 will attempt to address user complaints about fit and stability. (One of the most common issues with this wireless device has been users complaining that AirPods fall out of their ears.) Noise cancelling will be introduced to the base model, and greater Siri integration promises to allow users more control over their phone from the AirPods themselves.\nThe endpoint, in theory, is an AirPod/Intelligence integration that allows users simply to say \u201cSiri, call me a cab,\u201d then head outside and wait.\nArguably the biggest jump with the AirPods, though, comes in the medical context. The AirPods Pro 2 will function as a clinical hearing aid. Apple is seeking approval from the FDA to market their AirPods as medical devices. If successful, this feature will allow hearing-disabled customers to use their AirPods without interruption, switching from music to phone to ambient conversations without needing to switch devices.\nThe Market Minute newsletter can help you stay on top of financial and economic news that may impact Apple and other potential investments.\nFinally, Apple introduced the next generation of its Apple Watch. The Watch occupies an odd niche in the company\u2019s product ecosystem. Although technologically integrated with Apple\u2019s suite of products, it has a lower rate of adoption and is generally used only by Apple\u2019s more dedicated or affluent customers.\nThe newest version will likely do little to change that trend. The new Apple Watch offers largely iterative improvements, including longer battery life, faster charging, lighter weight and a larger display.\nThe most significant improvements offered by the Apple Watch, like the AirPods, come in the health and wellness categories. The Watch will now come with sleep tracking software, heart rate monitors, and health alerts. It will also have a suite of fitness trackers, and related \u201clow cardio fitness\u201d alerts. This continues what has been a long-term push by Apple to try and market the Watch as a lifestyle and health device. In this way, it appears that Apple is trying to expand the Watch\u2019s customer footprint, marketing it not only as a peripheral to the iPhone but also as an independent device for improving personal health, sleep and fitness.\nFrom a share price perspective, there has been little immediate reaction to Apple\u2019s product announcements. Trading opened at around $221 per share on September 9 and closed at around $220 per share, after a day in which prices rose and fell within a range of about $4. The event occurred during market hours.\nThe bigger question will be how markets, investors and customers react going forward. In particular, will they see the new Intelligence software as a reason for customers to upgrade?\nThis is likely to be the dispositive issue when it comes to market impact. In recent years Apple\u2019s customers have largely seemed satisfied with the products they already own, which is a problem for a company that has come to rely on them regularly upgrading. In the iPhone, the AirPods and the Apple Watch categories, Apple is trying to offer a reason for customers to buy something new. This is particularly true with the iPhone 16, with which Apple is marketing Intelligence as a product-changing feature upgrade.\nIf analysts and customers agree, this is likely to have a significant market impact on Apple\u2019s stock. It is likely that the first real information on this subject will come on September 13, when preorders open for the iPhone 16.\nSign up for the Market Minute newsletter to keep up to date on the stock market and other financial news.\nOn September 9, 2024, Apple announced a series of new products for its iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch devices. While the market impact has been muted so far, the company is hoping that this will excite users to upgrade their existing devices and boost sales.\nArguably the last time Apple made a big step forward was when it adopted 5G in the iPhone 12.

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL)'s iPhone 16 launch is clouded in China by competitive pressure from local players and uncertainty over when the country might get access to its Apple Intelligence feature, according to analysts.\nHours after the US consumer electronics giant is expected to launch its iPhone 16 line-up on September 9, California time, Huawei Technologies will have its own event, where it is expected to unveil its 'tri-fold' smartphone with two hinges. Richard Yu Chengdong, the chairman of Huawei's global business group, said the company will launch \"the most leading, innovative, and disruptive\" product at the event scheduled for September 10, China time.\nApple has already been facing mounting pressure in China, one of the company's most important markets, and recently fell out of the top five vendors by shipments. Its challenges could be exacerbated with the iPhone 16 given uncertainty around its ability to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. The built-in artificial intelligence (AI) is powered in part by OpenAI's GPT large language models (LLMs), which cannot be made commercially available in China.\n\"iPhone will continue to see erosion [of its market share] in the premium segment by Huawei and other Chinese brands,\" said Ivan Lam, senior analyst at consultancy Counterpoint Research.\nApple saw its sales dip 5.7 per cent in the Chinese market in the second quarter despite an overall 6 per cent sales increase over the period owing to recovering consumer demand, according to Counterpoint data.\nAll major Chinese smartphone brands managed to grow their businesses over the period except for Oppo, whose sales declined by nearly 10 per cent. Huawei had the biggest gain for the quarter, growing more than 44 per cent, thanks to the roll-out of its Pura 70 and Nova 12 series.\nChina has kept tight control over which generative AI products can be made available to the public, requiring that models be registered with a central regulator for approval before services go live. China to date has approved more than 180 GenAI products, all of which are developed by local firms.\nApple Intelligence is meant to give an overhaul of the company's virtual assistant, Siri, giving it better context awareness and allowing it to offer better answers to user queries. Other AI features include helping users draft emails and edit images.\nSome companies partnered with local providers to offer AI services on their devices. Samsung Electronics is using Baidu's Ernie LLM for its Galaxy phones.\nApple has so far given no indication of how it plans to offer AI in China. This could potentially leave Apple at a disadvantage as smartphone companies race to integrate AI, according to Lucas Zhong, an analyst at Canalys.\nDespite the uncertain timeline, though, Zhong said that Apple's prioritisation of privacy could make its own in-house LLM - which it uses in addition to GPT - among the most likely of foreign AI models to get regulatory approval in the country.\nCounterpoint's Lam said pent-up demand from people looking to upgrade their iPhones may still help drive sales of the new handsets in China. Sales could be \"slightly higher\" in the second half of 2024 compared with a year ago, he added.\nIan Ma, a financial professional in Beijing who currently uses an iPhone 14 Pro Max, said he is interested in the iPhone 16, regardless of its AI capabilities. A number of Chinese iPhone users even mused on social media about buying overseas models to get access to Apple Intelligence, although software features are typically made available according to the country associated with the Apple ID account.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Title": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): \u2018Once Again, The Apple Analysts Were All Over the Place\u2019",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Cramer's Morning Thoughts: 20 Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains that if you're investing with real money, not just playing a simulation like a stock market game, it\u2019s essential to open a real investment account. Reflecting on his own experience from 1979, he recalls that there were no online accounts back then. Since he already had some money in a Mellon Fund account through Fidelity, he decided to open his individual stock account with them as well.\nIn the early days of his investing journey, Cramer admits he didn\u2019t have a clear source for stock ideas, so he turned to Forbes, a magazine he trusted. One article caught his eye about American Agronomics, a promising orange-growing company in Florida. It looked like a good opportunity, so he invested in 10 shares. Unfortunately, disaster struck when a frost destroyed the crops, slashing his investment in half. Cramer likens this experience to the storyline of the movie Trading Places. While the loss was painful, he emphasizes that it didn't crush his determination to keep learning and investing.\n\"At first, I didn\u2019t know where to look for stock ideas, so I turned to a magazine I liked, Forbes. No offense to Forbes, but I read an interesting article about American Agronomics, a compelling orange grower in Florida. It seemed like a solid pick, so I bought 10 shares. Later, a frost hit, wiping out the crops and cutting my investment in half\u2014 a bit like the plot of Trading Places, if you\u2019ve ever seen that classic Eddie Murphy movie. I was devastated but not defeated.\"\nJim Cramer shares a story about one of his early investing experiences. After suffering a loss on his previous investment, he sold off his remaining shares and used the leftover money to buy seven shares of Bobby Brooks, a clothing company recommended by Forbes. Unfortunately, the company reported poor financial results, and Cramer lost even more money. At the time, he had a stable job at American Lawyer magazine, earning $20,000 a year, and was living in a small, affordable studio apartment. This low cost of living allowed him to quickly rebuild his stock portfolio despite his earlier losses.\nDuring his work travels, Cramer once had a great breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and discovered the company was publicly traded. Intrigued, he returned to New York and went to the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, where he studied everything he could find about Bob Evans Farms and compared it with other companies in the same industry. Based on this research, he bought 20 shares of the company. His investment paid off when the stock rose after a strong financial quarter and a stock split. Through this experience, Cramer learned an important lesson: \"Know what you own.\"\n\"During my travels for work, I once had an amazing breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and learned that the company was publicly traded. When I returned to New York, I visited the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, read everything I could about Bob Evans, and compared it with other companies in the industry. Armed with that research, I bought 20 shares. The stock rose immediately following a good quarter and a stock split. That\u2019s when I learned my first key investment lesson: know what you own.\"\nJim Cramer shared that his passion for stocks didn't ignite in adulthood after law school or college, or even in high school. It started much earlier, back in the fourth grade. According to him, his father would bring home the Philadelphia Bulletin, one of the largest newspapers in the country at the time. While most kids would eagerly flip to the comics or sports section, Jim was a huge Phillies fan, he found himself intrigued by something else. Curiosity got the best of him.\nThe business section of the paper, full of lists of names and numbers, looked like an indecipherable code compared to the baseball stats he regularly pored over. Terms like \"open,\" \"range,\" and \"close\" didn't make any sense to him, so he asked his dad, who had some experience dabbling in the stock market.\nHis dad encouraged him, and Jim began tracking stock names he heard on the radio, keeping a record of their daily performance in a ledger. For him, it became a fun game of prediction, much like analyzing baseball stats. He didn\u2019t know much about the companies he was tracking, many were defense stocks that were performing well due to the Vietnam War, but it didn\u2019t matter. The thrill of figuring out the next move kept him hooked.\nNot long after, Jim introduced this \"stock game\" to his fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off his ledger and inviting his classmates to join in the fun. Though not everyone was interested, the lesson was clear: starting early can ignite a lifelong interest. For Cramer, this early exposure to the stock market became the foundation of his love for investing.\n\"Fast forward a bit, and I introduced this \"stock game\" to my fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off my ledger and challenging my classmates to play. Not everyone was into it, but the lesson here is clear: get them started early. That\u2019s how I fell in love with the stock market.\"\nJim Cramer's takeaway from his childhood stock obsession is simple: start young. The stock market is a long-term game, and the earlier you get involved, the higher your chances of winning will get.\nOur Methodology\nThis article delves into Jim Cramer\u2019s latest Morning Thoughts posts which list the top stocks Cramer's watching before the markets open. After going through his posts, we sorted the picks from his watchlist by hedge fund sentiment. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nAccording to the latest Morning Thoughts post, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) analysts are offering mixed opinions on the new AI-ready iPhone 16. JPMorgan pointed to the longer lead times as an indicator of strong demand, while Barclays took a more cautious view, citing less optimistic supply chain checks.\n\"Once again, the Apple analysts were all over the place with JPMorgan saying lead times for the new AI-ready iPhone 16 suggest healthy demand while Barclays sees more muted checks.\"\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) presents a strong investment case due to its impressive growth in services, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), and a solid product lineup, despite facing challenges in China. In Q2 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s services segment, which includes the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Music, generated $23.9 billion in revenue, reflecting a 14% increase from the previous year. This growth is driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, highlighting a stable, high-margin revenue stream that is a positive sign for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s long-term prospects.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also making strides in AI integration, with significant announcements expected at its upcoming WWDC event that could enhance its AI capabilities and provide new growth opportunities. Although iPhone sales fell by 10.5% in Q2 2024 due to tough year-over-year comparisons, demand remains strong in key markets like India and Europe, helping to balance slower sales in China. The launch of upcoming products like the iPhone 16 and Vision Pro is anticipated to further drive growth into 2025.\nAdditionally,Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is dedicated to returning value to shareholders, distributing $27 billion through dividends and share buybacks in Q2. This is supported by a $110 billion share repurchase program and a 4% increase in dividends.\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained but detracted from relative performance due to our underweight. While the company\u2019s overall and iPhone revenues declined year over year, the unveiling of an upgraded iPad Pro and iPad Air boosted investor sentiment. In particular, the introduction of generative AI features allayed concerns that Apple was not keeping pace with competitors.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

With expectations for an iPhone 16, updated Apple Watches and AirPods, investors are curious if this event will light up Apple's stock or leave it dim.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng remains optimistic about Apple\u2019s long-term prospects, reiterating a Buy rating and a 12-month price target of $276, reflecting 23.9% upside expectations for the stock.\nApple stock generally underperforms the broad market on the day of iPhone announcements, the analyst said.

In Alabama, that\u2019d be between $39,739 and $119,218 a year.

You can start this week.\nPrice: $1,199 (base price)\nThere are two main versions of the iPhone 15 Pro:\nBase model with its 6.1-inch display\niPhone 15 Pro Max with its 6.7-inch display\nYou can get the Max version on Apple\u2019s website. You can also customize the color and storage, as well as decide which carrier you want to use. Plus, you can add AppleCare+ coverage to your device.\nIf you go with the Max model and upgrade to 1TB of storage and two years of coverage with AppleCare+ (with theft and loss protection), the total cost would be about $1,868.\nCheck Out: What the Upper Middle Class Make in Different US Cities\nPrice: $1,299 (base price)\nThis device\u2018s base price might not seem too bad, but it can get pretty expensive when upgraded.\nIt comes with a powerful ultra-retina XDR display and is available in either 11 or 13 inches. With both of these, you can choose your preferred color finish (silver or black) and select your desired storage ranging from 256GB to 2TB.\nIf you choose the larger product with extra storage and other upgrades like nano-texture glass, a magic keyboard for iPad Pro, and AppleCare+, it will cost $3,246.\nPrice: $699 (base price)\nTwo versions of the Apple Watch Series 9 exist: aluminum and stainless steel. The latter is more expensive and comes with built-in GPS. If you choose to customize it, you could end up spending closer to $1,228.\nPrice: $1,299 (base price)\nAt its base price, the MacBook Air isn\u2019t super expensive. The 13-inch version, which comes with an M2 chip, is just under $1,000. The newer model is a few hundred dollars more. But when you upgrade it, you could be looking at spending nearly $3,000 \u2014 that\u2019s enough to get you a decent desktop computer.\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019d get for the more expensive price: 2TB SSD storage, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and 24GB unified memory. If you don\u2019t need these upgrades, you might want to stick with the original model, which features an 8-Core CPU, 10-Core GPU, 16GB unified memory, and 512GB SSD for storage. It also has other nice features like a 1080p FaceTime HD camera and Magic Keyboard with Touch ID.\nPrice: $549 (base price)\nAirPods Max come in five colors, including gray, silver, green, pink, and sky blue. They also feature active noise cancelation, transparency mode, and have up to 20 hours of playtime before needing a recharge. You can even get a free engraving on them, which makes them a great personalized gift.\nThe reason they make this list is simply because they\u2019re so expensive. If you need a decent pair of headphones, you could shave off a couple of hundred dollars by going with a non-Apple product.\nPrice: $3,499 (base price)\nThe Apple Vision Pro is a virtual reality headset that lets you do everything from watching movies and listening to music to playing games and using different apps. It\u2019s on the more expensive side, however.\nUpgrading it puts it at an even higher price point. For example, if you add on the ZEISS Optical Inserts (a prescription option), 1TB of storage, and AppleCare+, the total cost would be over $4,500.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Moves For Building Lasting Wealth: What Smart Americans Are Doing Right\n3 Best Florida Cities To Buy Property in the Next 5 Years, According To Real Estate Agents\nThe Average Consumer Has $6,329 in Credit Card Debt.

        "Author": "  Michael Grothaus ",
        "Text": "iOS 18 has introduced many awesome new software features for the iPhone, particularly when it comes to productivity and privacy. Yet the best new software feature Apple has released this year isn\u2019t for the iPhone. It\u2019s for the Mac, and it\u2019s called iPhone Mirroring. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s so extraordinary. Plus, some tips on putting it to use.\nMost Read from Fast Company\nWhen Hurricane Helene hit, this disaster-proof Florida neighborhood kept the lights on\nHousing market shift: Here\u2019s where homebuyers are gaining power fast\nCandy and snack recall, FDA update: List of products that may be contaminated with salmonella\niPhone Mirroring is a new feature in macOS Sequoia that allows you to use your iPhone on your Mac. When you launch the new iPhone Mirroring app on your Mac, your Mac will automatically connect to your iPhone and display a digital twin version of it on your desktop.\nYou can interact with this digital twin of your iPhone using your Mac\u2019s keyboard, mouse, and trackpad. In other words, you can fully interact with your iPhone without even taking it out of your pocket.\nOnce your iPhone\u2019s digital twin is displayed on your Mac\u2019s desktop, you can do virtually anything with it that you can do on the iPhone itself. You can swipe through the iPhone\u2019s home screens, launch any app on your iPhone, and then use that iPhone app right on your Mac\u2019s desktop. This digital twin looks exactly like your real iPhone\u2014down to the arrangement of its apps, widgets, and wallpaper background.\niPhone Mirroring feels like magic. It is fluid and responsive and now gives you a way to use apps that are exclusive to the iPhone right on your Mac. For example, if you have a favorite messenger app that doesn\u2019t have a Mac counterpart, you can launch the iPhone Mirroring app on your Mac, open the messaging app in your iPhone\u2019s digital twin, and then use your Mac\u2019s keyboard to type out a reply to the last message you received.\nBut iPhone Mirroring goes even further. When you get a notification on your iPhone, that notification will appear in the Notification Center on your Mac. This means that if you are working at your desk, you no longer need to check your iPhone to see your notifications\u2014they\u2019ll appear instantly on your computer.\nThere are several situations in which iPhone Mirroring can come in handy. The first is when you are working at home and want to quickly use an app on your iPhone but you don\u2019t have it nearby. Instead of hunting down your iPhone (perhaps it\u2019s in your bedroom, charging) you can just launch iPhone Mirroring and do what you need to do.\nAnother great use case is when you are working in a public space like a coffee shop. Thieves love coffee shops because people often have their laptops and phones on the tabletop. It\u2019s relatively easy for an experienced thief to snatch our iPhone, especially when we are distracted by whatever we are working on on our MacBook. But now, you can now just leave your iPhone securely stored in your pocket the whole time, and if you do need to access information on it, you can simply launch its digital twin on your Mac.\nAnd yet another great use case is coming later this year. In a future software update, iPhone Mirroring will allow you to drag and drop files like documents, movies, and photos between your Mac and iPhone. For example, say you want to save a PDF copy of your boarding pass to your iPhone. Now you can just launch iPhone Mirroring on your Mac and drag the PDF from your Mac\u2019s desktop onto the digital twin of your iPhone and the file will instantly be added to your real iPhone. No more needing to email files to yourself.\niPhone Mirroring is one of those rare software features that makes you sit up and say \u201cwow\u201d when you use it for the first time\u2014and it\u2019s a feature that every Mac user should take advantage of.\niPhone Mirroring requires an Apple Silicon Mac or an Intel-based Mac with a T2 security chip running macOS Sequoia, as well as an iPhone running iOS 18.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

        "Author": "  Jenn Brice ",
        "Text": "Apple unveiled its latest iPhone on Monday, along with updates to other key products like the Watch and the AirPods.\nThe new hardware bring some new looks, beefier under-the-hood processing power, and a slew of capabilities, including health features such as hearing aid and sleep apnea monitoring technology.\nAnd of course, there's Apple Intelligence, the company's AI system, announced in June, coming to the latest iPhones, iPads, and Macs. You can watch a replay of the launch event video here.\nAnd here's a recap of all the new product announcements:\nFour new models: iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max\nThe latest version of Apple's flagship product, the iPhone, puts AI front and center, with a slew of integrated AI features, and two new buttons on the side of the device, including the a new \"camera control\" button.\nThe iPhone 16s have a new, touch sensitive \"camera control\" that lets users adjust settings like zoom and depth-of-field by sliding a finger alongside the surface of button, and quickly summon AI features by pressing the button when the phone is pointed at real world objects.\nAn \"action\" button, on the other side of the device, gives users a quick shortcut that can be customized to launch a variety of features. The button, which replaces the mute switch and was introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro models last year, will now be standard across all iPhone models.\nWhile not as radical a shift in design as the foldable screen phones some of Apple's competitors are rolling out, the new iPhone buttons are a big change in the context of Apple's modus operandi.\nThe iPhone 16s will be powered by new A18 and A18 Pro chips, even smaller transistors that pack 17% more memory bandwidth. The A18 Pro tech boasts central processing that is 15% faster than on A17 Pro, and a graphics processing unit that is 20% faster.\nSiri will learn to harness the power of Apple Intelligence. On the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, Siri will use a \u201cpersonal semantic index\u201d to do things like rewrite notes into professional emails.\nWriting tools integrated into iOS will turn notes into formal invites, tweak the tone of a Slack message, and create custom emojis (like a cowboy frog!). And by typing a description from your memory into photos, Apple Intelligence will retrieve footage, down to a specific moment in a video.\nThe Pro comes in four titanium finishes, including a new \u201cdesert\u201d gold shade. Apple execs also boasted more powerful battery life for the suite of 16s but didn't specify the capacity.\nThe iPhone 16 starts at $799 and $899 for the iPhone 16 Plus, with up to $800 off with trade in. The Pro model starts at $999.\nApple kicked off Monday's event by unveiling the latest version of the Apple Watch \u2014 Series X (pronounced Series 10).\nThe Series X Watch, which starts at $399, will have the biggest display, thinnest design yet, with up to 30% more screen area than previous generations, Apple COO Jeff Williams said. And at 9.7 millimeters, the new watch is 10% thinner than Series 9, and weighs 20% less.\nThe Series X will be available in jet black, rose gold, and silver.\u00a0Williams also announces Titanium finishes, which \u201ccelebrate the beauty of metal\u201d in natural, gold, and slate gray.\nAs for AI: ML will help with crash detection, and a new neural network will make for clearer calls.\nAlong with ovulation and sleep stage tracking, the new watch will be able to detect sleep apnea using an accelerometer to identify breathing disturbances. Clearance from FDA and other regulators is expected soon, Apple said.\nApple executive Julz Arney said the Series X can detect water temperature and depth up to 20 ft - \u201cperfect for snorkeling!\u201d And a tides app will show rising, falling, high, and low tides with data for coastlines \u201call over the world.\u201d\nSeries X starts at $399 and is available Sept. 20. Available for preorder starting today.\nApple's showed off the fourth generation of its wireless AirPods, AirPods 4, and teased a new software update that will turn AirPods Pro 2 into a hearing aid.\nApple says it designed the new AirPods 4 by mapping and analyzing \u201cthousands of earshapes\u201d and generating 50 million data points \u2014 all of which will presumably make the earbuds fit snuggly.\nPersonalized Spatial Audio will enable an \"immersive media experience,\u201d and machine learning has made using AirPods for calls easier and clearer. AirPods will respond to a nod to pick up calls. There will be a button to play/pause music and mute or end calls. Apple is also offering a version of the AirPods 4 with active noise cancelling for an extra $50.\nThe case for the AirPods 4 is 10% smaller (hopefully not 10% easier to lose), and includes USB-C charging.\nOne of the most interesting bits of AirPods news is not about new hardware, but rather, a software update coming to the existing AirPods Pro. The update will transform the AirPods Pro into a \"clinical grade\" hearing aid for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, the company said, citing a study that found 75% of people diagnosed with hearing loss haven\u2019t gotten help.\nApple will also release a 5-minute clinically validated hearing test that will be stored in the Health App as part of the hearing aid offering, which it said will be available in more than 100 countries this Fall following authorization from global health authorities.\nNext Gen AirPods 4 are $129 and AirPods 4 with noise cancellation are $179. Available Sept. 20.\nAirPods Max will now come in Midnight, blue, purple, orange and gold-ish \u201cstarlight.\u201d They\u2019re still $549.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

They added that the initial release will only be available in U.S. English, with support for other languages planned over the next year.\nDespite the clamour for an AI-enhanced iPhone, the analysts remain cautious on Apple stock, citing regulatory headwinds, geopolitical risks, and economic challenges.\nStill, Apple's foray into gen AI will be closely watched to see how the tech product trendsetter plans to maintain its \"competitive edge in an increasingly saturated smartphone market,\" they added.\nRelated Articles\nApple's new iPhone to glow, but AI software to steal show at next week's launch\nLawmakers probe if US retailers bought Chinese auto parts that evaded tariffs\nBooking Holdings, Expedia Group face slowing travel headwinds amid wary consumers\n"

        "Text": "CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Apple squarely shifted its focus toward artificial intelligence with the unveiling of its hotly anticipated iPhone 16 along with a slew of new features coming with the next update to the device\u2019s operating system. While the new phone lineup headlined Monday's showcase, the tech giant also shared updates to its smartwatch and AirPod lineups.\nHere are all the biggest announcements from Apple's \u201cGlowtime\u201d event.\nApple Intelligence\nApple's core artificial intelligence offerings are being packaged and billed as Apple Intelligence \u2014 first revealed at the company's developers conference in June.\nThese features include the ability to search for images in your library by describing them, creating custom emojis, summarizing emails and prioritizing notifications. Apple Intelligence will also upgrade Apple's virtual assistant Siri to get it to better understand requests and give it some awareness of on-screen actions taking place on the phone, hopefully making it more useful.\nWhat sets Apple apart from what's being offered by rivals Samsung and Google? It is trying to preserve its longtime commitment to privacy by tailoring its AI so that most of its functions are processed on the device itself instead of at remote data centers. When a task requires a connection to a data center, Apple promises it will be done in a tightly controlled way that ensures no personal data is stored remotely.\nMost of Apple\u2019s AI functions will roll out as part of a free software update to iOS 18, the operating system that will power the iPhone 16 rolling out from October through December. U.S. English will be the featured language at launch but an update enabling other languages will come out next year, according to Apple.\niPhone 16 and the camera button\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will offer slightly bigger displays and feature variants of the powerful A18 chip, which gives Apple the computing power its devices need to run AI functions.\nThe iPhone 16 \u201chas been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said during Monday's event.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the biggest physical change to the iPhone 16 lineup comes in the form of a dedicated camera-control button. The button responds to clicks and gestures, allowing users to quickly snap pictures, preview a shot or start video recording.\nThe button also allows owners to use something called Visual Intelligence, which will tell the iPhone 16 to automatically search on things you take photos of.\nThe phones will start shipping Sept. 20. The iPhone 16 will retail for $799, with the Plus model going for $899. The iPhone 16 Pro will cost $999, while the Pro Max will sell for $1,199.\nApple Watch upgrades\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 features a larger, and brighter, wide-angle OLED display that will allow users to better view the watch at an angle. But Apple focused much of its presentation on the device's ability to detect signs of sleep apnea.\nThe new device is also being offered in a titanium finish for the first time, joining a longtime trend in the watch industry of offering a tougher, more lightweight, and perceived higher-quality, alternative to traditional materials.\nThe Series 10 watch starts at $399 and will be available on Sept. 20.\nAirpods lean toward being a listening device\nThe new AirPods 4 series will come with an upgraded chip for better audio quality, and will feature more active noise cancellation.\nIf you frequently lose your ear buds, the new AirPods will also play a sound when you locate them through the Find My app.\nIn a medically focused update to the AirPods Pro 2, Apple said it will upgrade the devices so they can act as an over-the-counter hearing aid. A free software update will provide the upgrade and also include options to help protect hearing and the ability to administer a clinical-grade hearing test.\nThe AirPod 4 model costs $129, while the version with active noise cancelling will cost $179. They both ship on Sept. 20.\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: 1 Stock That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the most valuable company in the world right now with a market cap of $3.4 trillion. But a closer look at the company's recent financial performance indicates that it is finding it difficult to put its growth into a higher gear.\nFor instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 29), Apple's revenue increased just 5% year over year to $85.8 billion. Analysts are expecting this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock to finish the year with a 9% increase in revenue to $390 billion. Additionally, its revenue is expected to increase by just 8% in the next fiscal year.\nThis lukewarm growth at Apple can be attributed to the company's already massive revenue base. Moreover, Apple's bread-and-butter end market of smartphones is already quite huge, and its growth has stagnated. Market research firm IDC estimates that the global smartphone market could reach an annual growth rate of just 2.3% through 2028.\nConsidering that Apple is reliant on the iPhone for 52% of its revenue, it is not surprising to see that it's not expected to grow at a blistering pace anymore. This is precisely the reason Apple could lose its crown as the world's most valuable company to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), a company that is sitting on lucrative and fast-growing end markets that could help it deliver impressive growth over the next decade.\nLet's look at the reasons why Nvidia could be worth more than Apple after a decade.\nNvidia is currently the third-most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $2.85 trillion, which means that it is not very far from catching Apple. The terrific pace at which Nvidia has been growing tells us that it can indeed catch the iPhone maker over the next decade.\nThe company, which is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), reported phenomenal revenue growth of 122% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to $30 billion. Nvidia has been riding the artificial intelligence (AI) wave, with its chips being deployed for training popular AI models such as ChatGPT. And now, Nvidia is diversifying into areas beyond AI training so that it can sustain its handsome growth for a long time to come.\nFor instance, on its August earnings conference call, Nvidia management pointed out that AI inference applications have accounted for more than 40% of its data center revenue. This is an important trend to note as inference is the process of using a trained AI model to generate results from a fresh set of data. So, Nvidia has moved beyond AI training and is now getting a nice chunk of revenue from the AI inferencing space as well.\nThat's good news for the company's long-term prospects as its presence in both these markets should allow it to remain a dominant force in AI chips. Investors should note that the market for AI chips is expected to generate $300 billion in revenue in 2034, growing at an annual rate of 22% over the next decade.\nNvidia reportedly controls 70% to 95% of the AI chip market, according various estimates, leaving very little for rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. It won't be surprising to see that trend continue over the next decade as well, as a result of which Nvidia could sustain its elevated levels of growth for a long time to come.\nAdditionally, Nvidia is diversifying into lucrative markets such as AI enterprise software, where it has started witnessing impressive growth. This could unlock another lucrative growth opportunity for the company as the AI software market is expected to generate a whopping $1 trillion in revenue by 2032, according to Precedence Research.\nThen again, Nvidia has other solid growth drivers in the form of the nascent but potentially massive cloud gaming space where it has already established a solid position for itself. All this explains why the company is forecast to grow at a much faster pace than Apple.\nAnalysts are expecting Apple's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% over the next five years. There is a chance that the iPhone maker's earnings growth could accelerate in the long run thanks to the growing contribution of the company's high-margin services business, but it is likely to be hamstrung by the slow pace of growth in smartphone sales over the next decade.\nPrecedence Research estimates that the global smartphone market could see 7% annual growth through 2034. While that's rosier than IDC's forecast, Precedence believes that the adoption of technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality are likely to help the smartphone market achieve faster growth. But it is worth noting that these technologies have been around for some time and they haven't been enough to inject life into the smartphone market.\nOn the other hand, the advent of AI turned out to be a massive catalyst for Nvidia. Analysts are forecasting the company's earnings to increase at a CAGR of 52% over the next five years, a much faster pace than what Apple is expected to report. Moreover, Nvidia's end markets are set to grow at a much faster pace than Apple's, and the good part is that the company is the dominant player in most of those markets.\nSo, there is a good chance that Nvidia could outperform Apple's growth by a big margin over the next decade, and the market could reward the former with more upside as a result and help it become a more valuable company.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Mark Zuckerberg declares Meta \u2018the opposite\u2019 of Apple in comments reigniting Tim Cook feud",
        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "If Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s new laid-back look\u2014complete with shaggy hair and chunky gold chain\u2014is any indication, he\u2019s much different from the straightlaced, crew-cutted Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that the business philosophies of Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta (META) and Apple are as different as their two leaders. Zuckerberg has been eager to point out those differences and prod at a decades-long feud between the two tech giants and their chief executives.\nWhile Meta has prioritized acting fast and engaging users, such as through its open-sourcing of its Llama AI model, Zuckerberg said in the Acquired podcast episode released Tuesday, Apple prefers maintaining a closed ecosystem of polished, exclusive products.\n\"I think in a lot of ways we're like the opposite of Apple,\" he said. \"Clearly, their stuff has worked really well too. They take this approach that's like, 'We're going to take a long time, we're going to polish it, we're going to put it out,' and maybe for the stuff that they're doing that works, maybe that just fits with their culture.\"\nSince Tim Cook took the helm of the tech behemoth, Apple has prided itself on being the best, rather than the first. For the most part, it\u2019s worked out for the company, demonstrated by its superlative of the world's largest smartphone provider. Apple has long tended to its walled garden of in-house products, which has resulted in a uniform line of apps and accessories bespoke to its tech\u2014and a whopping antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice.\nBut Zuckerberg touted Meta\u2019s own spaghetti-at-the-wall approach to its products, which he believes has elicited helpful critiques and enabled the company to grow in spite of its failures.\n\"You want to really have a culture that values shipping and getting things out and getting feedback more than needing always to get great positive accolades from people when you put stuff out,\" he said.\nThere\u2019s certainly been no shortage of feedback toward Meta, exemplified by social media platform Thread\u2019s meteoric rise to 100 million users, only for the number of accounts to atrophy weeks later. Its flagship Metaverse was a $46.5 billion failure, but that still hasn\u2019t stopped Zuckerberg from adding $58 billion to his net worth this year.\nApple\u2019s perfectionism has been at its own expense, Zuckerberg said, arguing the company prioritizes praise above constructive feedback from users.\n\"If you want to wait until you get praised all the time,\u201d he said, \u201cyou're missing a bunch of the time when you could've learned a bunch of useful stuff and then incorporated that into the next version you're going to ship.\u201d\nApple and Meta did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s requests for comment.\nZuckerberg\u2019s commentary on Apple\u2019s ways of doing business is not the first time he\u2019s shared his thoughts on Cook\u2019s company. For over a decade, he and Cook have differed on their philosophies not only on how to roll out products, but on the future of the internet more broadly.\nEarlier this month Meta and Apple\u2019s feud reached a fever pitch after Meta urged greater government regulation of social media platforms, suggesting Apple and Google set age restrictions and requirements for parental consent. But Apple disagreed, arguing the onus for restrictions should be placed on the platform themselves.\nTensions between the two companies have been tightening since 2014, when Cook suggested Facebook made its money through the collection of personal data. The following year, Apple unveiled its motto, \u201cPrivacy is a fundamental human right.\u201d Cook also lambasted Facebook as a hotbed for Russian misinformation used to mislead American voters ahead of the 2016 election.\nZuckerberg seems keen on fanning the flames of the tech rivalry today, calling Apple Meta\u2019s \u201cprimary competitor\u201d on Tuesday\u2019s podcast. Cook historically has not agreed.\n\"Oh, I think that we compete in some things,\" Cook said in 2021. \"But no, if I may ask who our biggest competitors are, they would not be listed. We're not in the social networking business.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +1.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $94.52 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $390.63 billion and $424.09 billion estimates indicate +1.9% and +8.6% changes, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other blue chip stocks.\nWhile economic data may be scarce, every data point gives a new angle to the ever-uncertain economic conditions in the US. On September 12, Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Asset Allocation, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market moves after the consumer price index (CPI) report was released on Wednesday.\nDraho suggested how regular intra-day moves did not hold enough weight to impact or influence the Fed\u2019s decision. However, he did acknowledge that the inflation data and Wall Street\u2019s reaction to it make the case for a 25-basis cut, or more, in the upcoming Fed meeting.\nDraho then hinted that investors are hoping for a soft landing and are looking for stronger reasons or economic cues to hold back, given that bad economic news, as of now, has not triggered investors as much. He also emphasized the need for more financial data and clarity on whether the Fed would be proactive with its rate cuts for further analysis.\nContrary to what investors wish, he believes the Fed will be rather hawkish than proactive with its rate-cutting cycle. He adds that while the market calls for 100 basis points in rate cuts by the end of this year, he does expect the Fed to signal way less.\nHe then shed light on supply challenges in the technology sector, hinting that demand is not the issue at the moment. He was particularly impressed by the earnings posted by AI companies. Draho expects tech companies to have strong balance sheets and strong earnings power by the end of 2024, making them attractive stocks despite the economic turmoil.\nOn September 13, Andrew Krei, Crescent Grove Advisors co-chief investment officer, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his bullish outlook on the economy and financial markets. Krei discussed the labor market trends and how they may impact the Fed\u2019s decisions in the upcoming meeting.\nKrei pressed that despite the \u201cunwarranted\u201d volatility over the past few weeks, the economic outlook remains favorable, with credit markets showing close to no signs of stress. Krei also shed light on the global economic backdrop, suggesting that international markets, especially Europe, Japan, and China were showing strong signs of recovery in trade and manufacturing.\nAs far as investment goes, Krei suggests that while mega-cap tech stocks have shown promising results, he is more bullish on stocks outside of the magnificent 7. He was particularly inclined to companies in healthcare, finance, and industrials, hinting that these sectors will benefit immensely from the easing cycle. He then suggested that investors must shift their focus to diversified stocks with lower valuations and relatively stronger risk-adjusted returns.\nWhatever the state of the economy, some stocks are notorious for their strong and consistent financial results.\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 12 best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers, we first went over multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of blue chip stocks. We then found the companies with the lowest short float and ranked the top 12 with the largest number of hedge fund holders and lowest short float percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 0.80%\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company behind the iPhone, is one of the best blue chip stocks to invest in. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nIn the FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple\u2019s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. With pre-orders for the iPhone 16 opening on September 16, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to report strong financial results for the rest of 2024.\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 12% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion.\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion.\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\"\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%\u200b.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The stock has been hit in recent days following reports that the pre-orders for the much-awaited iPhone 16 series have been below analyst expectations and are down more than 10% compared to pre-orders for the previous version of the phone. According to reports, 37 million units of the new iPhone have been ordered, and one of the main reasons behind the slowdown in orders has been the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro. In the Pro version of the new iPhone, Apple Intelligence, the AI-powered features of the new Apple software, are not available at launch. China competition has also impacted iPhone sales.\nWhen it comes to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Wall Street analysts have bullish views. Investment advisory Loop Capital has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $300, implying upside potential of a handsome 32%. In a recent investor note, data cited by Loop Capital supply chain analyst John Donovan suggested that iPhone shipments for the September quarter were above market expectations.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the 19 trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0and\u00a0Seth Klarman\u00a0focus on value, and others like\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0focus on growth, Asness\u2019 fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock\u2019s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock\u2019s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock\u2019s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital\u2019s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\nThese\u00a0returns\u00a0ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\nLooking at the\u00a0returns\u00a0for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are\u00a0plotted\u00a0over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund\u2019s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return\u2019s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022\u00a0according\u00a0to Bloomberg,\nAQR\u2019s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR\u2019s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey\u2019s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund\u2019s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as\u00a0Citadel Wellington,\u00a0Point72, and\u00a0Millennium\u00a05.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness\u2019 top stock picks, it\u2019s also important to see how his firms\u2019 funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed\u2019s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% \u2013 3.50% by 2025 end.\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR\u2019s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index\u2019s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark\u2019s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks \u201cconsidered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe\u201d has been the way to go so far in 2024.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital\u2019s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey\u2019s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 184\nAQR Funds\u2019 Latest Investment Stake: $1.73 billion\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) dominates the global consumer electronics industry courtesy of the iPhone. SEC filings show that 52% of the firm\u2019s revenue comes from smartphones. Consequently, the iPhone is the central pillar on which Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s hypothesis rests as it allows the firm to have a user base of roughly 1.46 billion users. This user base is used by investors to gauge the firm\u2019s future revenue by estimating when these users will upgrade their devices. The iPhone\u2019s strength has also enabled Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to create a $78 billion Services business by providing software service and taking payments from Google to make Google Search the default platform on its devices. Consequently, investors are also evaluating Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its ability to monetize consumer AI services through Apple Intelligence. Furthermore, any iPhone upgrade weakness or government action that stops Google\u2019s payments could spell trouble for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock.\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cRecent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in\u00a0Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The uncertainty regarding the availability of the Apple Intelligence feature in the country is an additional downer.\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s market share in China plunged to sixth place from third in the second quarter of 2024.

HONOR came third with a market share of 15%, backed by shipments of 10.7 million units, implying a 4% growth year-on-year.\nHuawei Technologies Co bagged the fourth position with a 15% market share supported by shipments of 10.6 million units, which grew by 41% year-on-year. Xiaomi Corp (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) came fifth with a market share of 14%, backed by a 17% year-on-year shipment increase to 10 million units.\nCanalys attributed the local brands\u2019 success to the early significant discounts and promotions backed by offline channel enhancements.\nThe local brands continue to tap the Chinese premium smartphone market by integrating generative artificial intelligence, and their deep collaboration with regional supply chains is a significant advantage, Canalys noted.\nCanalys also flagged Apple\u2019s struggle to maintain adequate inventory levels, keep retail prices in check, and maintain the margins of channel partners.\nHuawei\u2019s $2,800 Mate XT trifold phone launching on September 20 coincides with the release of the iPhone 16 models.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks.\u00a0Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe past several months of market activity and tech innovation has proved that the AI trends that started with the launch of ChatGPT are here to stay and all of this was not something that\u2019d fizzle out after making headlines for some time. Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the \u201cApp Store moment.\u201d\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\u201cAnnual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units. With AI, we expect this 10x growth trend to continue, with annual AI chatbots and applications potentially crossing 10bn units.\u201d\nFor this article we took a look at the latest analyst rating actions around AI stocks and picked the 10 most important AI companies that recently received positive comments or ratings from notable Wall Street analysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nBen Reitzes, Melius Research\u2019s head of technology research, said while talking to CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in a \u201cgenerational\u201d upgrade cycle.\n\u201cFirst, the installed base of phones is old. So, we have that going for us. Then, Apple Intelligence only works on the newer phones.\u201d\nThe analyst said that he\u2019s very \u201cupbeat\u201d on Apple shares. Asked about Buffett selling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, he said he might have \u201cother motivations.\u201d\nBen Reitzes said that he believes Apple\u2019s upgrade cycle would peak in 2026 and Wall Street expectations for Apple are easily beatable.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a new bull: billionaire Dan Loeb. The founder of the New York-based hedge fund Third Point said in a latest letter to investors that Apple has a significant upside potential due to AI.\n\u201cWe believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced \u2018Apple Intelligence\u2019 suite of AI-enabled smartphone features \u2013 the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant \u2013 will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple\u2019s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First,\u00a0 iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple\u2019s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer focused AI apps such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT (with which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple\u2019s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage.\u201d\nLoeb reiterated the bull case that many other Wall Street analysts have made. This case assumes that millions of people will upgrade their iPhones because they\u2019d want to use AI-powered new models of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship device.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nThird Point Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nIn April, we took a position in Apple, the world\u2019s leading consumer technology franchise, with an ecosystem of 2.2 billion devices spanning a broad array of form factors including smartphones, tablets, laptops, watches, earphones, and smart home devices. Apple excels in most of these device categories, with revenue share of 50-60% in several key markets.\nOverall, Apple Inc.

        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Personal electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) jumps off the page as a no-brainer winner in artificial intelligence (AI). There are many ways to integrate AI into iPhones, watches, and other Apple products. Wall Street has high expectations for the new iPhone 16, Apple's first iPhone launched with AI capabilities.\nRenowned tech stock analyst Dan Ives recently estimated that 300 million iPhones worldwide are over four years old, setting the stage for a supercycle, a period when many consumers upgrade their devices, revving Apple's growth.\nBut is the stock poised to see the pop investors hope for?\nRead this before buying Apple stock for its AI hype.\nApple's AI software, Apple Intelligence, will integrate large language models into iOS, creating new abilities and improving existing features, including upgraded Siri functionality. It is facing pressure to deliver a wave of iPhone upgrades. However, there are signs that it could fall short.\nFirst, Apple Intelligence will only be available to a limited customer base on day one, with the beta version to be released next month. Additional features, including non-English versions, will launch months afterward. In other words, Apple Intelligence will hit the market in a slow trickle rather than an exciting burst.\nA research firm surveyed existing iPhone users this summer about their upgrade plans. According to the results, 73% of respondents plan to upgrade primarily because their phones are obsolete or damaged -- only 18% plan to upgrade due to new features. The June survey predates the unveiling of the iPhone 16 in September. Still, Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence in early June, and AI had already found its way into Android smartphones by then, so it would seem that AI would have been on people's minds at the time.\nSo far, early pre-order data is mixed. An industry analyst recently reported that early pre-orders for the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus were up 10% and 48%, respectively, over last year's pre-order levels. However, the higher-end Pro and Pro Max versions were down 16% and 27%.\nAt least so far, it's hard to call this the game-changing supercycle Apple hopes for.\nIf the iPhone 16 falls short, the stock price could become an issue. You can see below that Apple has a long history of \"lumpy\" growth: A supercycle lifts Apple to new heights, followed by stagnation. Apple's last growth spurt came with the iPhone 12, its first with 5G network technology.\nSince then, you can see that Apple's sales have plateaued. Yet, the stock's valuation has run higher, possibly on the assumption that AI will create another supercycle, pushing Apple to the next level.\nIt's not easy growing earnings when you're a company large enough to generate nearly $400 billion in revenue. Apple is famous for its massive share repurchase programs, but earnings growth via buybacks likely won't be enough to support a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of nearly 35. Apple needs to grow past $400 billion in annual sales.\nInvestors should consider both sides of the coin before buying shares today.\nSuppose Apple blows past $400 billion in annual revenue and the iPhone 16 is a success. That's fantastic! The problem is that the stock has arguably priced that growth in already. Earnings could jolt higher, and Apple's valuation might only drop to a reasonable level. It's hard to envision enough earnings growth to make the stock cheap. Even if you double earnings-per-share, Apple's P/E ratio is still over 17, roughly where it traded before the pandemic.\nOn the flip side, if Wall Street deems Apple's AI iPhone cycle to be less than exceptional, the stock could experience a sharp decline. If the needle on earnings fails to move significantly, Apple's stock price would need to fall dramatically to recalibrate the P/E ratio to a more reasonable level for a large company facing growth challenges.\nGranted that Apple is one of the world's most powerful brands and companies, but that doesn't guarantee that the stock will treat you well. Apple stock is in a precarious position, which should give investors pause before jumping aboard the AI hype train.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    \u00b7 Reporter",
        "Text": "The S&P 500 just suffered its worst week since the 2023 regional banking scare as a mixed August jobs report failed to reinvigorate investor appetite.\nIn the holiday-shortened trading week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid more than 4% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled nearly 6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped almost 3%. The first week of September also marked the worst weekly return for the Nasdaq 100 since 2022, led by a more than 12% decline in Nvidia stock (NVDA).\nA fresh reading on inflation will headline the week ahead as investors continue to look for clues on how deeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting. Additionally, the first reading of consumer sentiment for September is slated for release on Friday.\nIn corporate news, Apple's annual iPhone event kicks off the week on Monday. Earnings results from Oracle (ORCL), Adobe (ADBE), and Kroger (KR) will lead an otherwise quiet week in scheduled company announcements.\nThe August jobs report showed the US economy added 142,000 nonfarm payroll jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.3% in July. Revisions to the June and July labor reports showed the US economy added 86,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in those months.\nCapital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown wrote in a note to clients Friday that given the report wasn't overly strong or exceedingly weak, it \"did not signal a clear winner\" in the debate over whether the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\nSpeeches from Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed president John Williams appeared to tilt the markets in favor of a 25 basis point cut.\nAs of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 25% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point cut in September, down from a 40% chance seen the day prior, per the CME Fed Watch tool.\nThe Goldman Sachs economics team led by Jan Hatzius reasoned Friday's Fed speak was consistent with Goldman's forecast for a 25 basis point cut in September but indicates \"that the Fed leadership is open to 50bp cuts at subsequent meetings if the labor market continues to deteriorate.\"\nWhile signs of slowing in the labor market have been top of mind for market participants over the past few weeks, inflation remains a key piece of when and how aggressively the Fed will cut rates. Wednesday will bring the final inflation reading before the Fed's next policy decision on Sep. 18 with the release of the August Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nWall Street expects an annual gain of 2.6% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, down from the 2.9% seen in July. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, in line with their monthly increase from July.\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3.2% year over year, unchanged from the prior month. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.2%, also unchanged from the prior month.\n\"Another benign CPI report could give enough FOMC members further 'confidence' that inflation is moving back to 2% on a sustainable basis for them to back a 50 bps rate cut,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"If, on the other hand, the inflation data are hotter than expected, then the consensus likely will coalesce around a 25 bps reduction on Sept. 18.\"\nThe top company release of the week will come on Monday when Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone event. The event is expected to provide more details on Apple's Apple Intelligence AI platform.\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley has the full preview. \nAnalysts slashed their earnings expectations for the current quarter by 2.8% during July and August, per FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. As Butters pointed out in a note on Friday afternoon, analysts typically cut their earnings estimates as the quarter goes on.\u00a0The current level isn't out of the ordinary, though. Analysts have slashed expectations by 3% on average for the past 20 years.\nBut still, it marks a shift in market sentiment compared to last quarter when analysts actually raised their estimates through the first two months of the quarter.\n\"Outside of the Magnificent 7, estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 [earnings per share] have been uninspiring, but at least stable,\" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nWhile not an alarming trend to macro strategists like Chronert just yet, the slight hit to what's otherwise been a solid fundamental case for stocks over the next year will be one to watch ahead of third quarter earnings season.\nEconomic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, August (2.97% previously); Wholesale inventories, July final (0.3% expected, 0.3% previously)\nEarnings: Oracle (ORCL), Rubrik (RBRK)\nTuesday\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, August (93.7 expected, 93.7 previously)\nEarnings: Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Dave & Buster's (PLAY), GameStop (GME), Petco (WOOF)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, August (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, August (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); CPI, year-over-year, August (+2.6% expected, +2.9% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, August (+3.2% expected, +3.2% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+0.7% previously)\nEarnings: Manchester United (MANU), Vera Bradley (VRA)\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Sept. 7 (230,000 expected, 233,00 previously); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, August (+0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); PPI, year-over-year, August (+0.2% expected, 0% previously)\nEarnings: Adobe (ADBE), Big Lots (BIG), Kroger (KR), RH (RH)\nFriday\nEconomic data: Import price index, month-over-month, August (-0.3% expected, +0.1% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, September preliminary (68.0 expected, 67.9 prior)\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n"

        "Text": "\nThe iPhone 16 was recently unveiled, garnering a range of reactions.\nThe new \"camera control\" button was a focus of the presentation for some.\nApple's much-discussed AI features were also a focus.\n\nApple (AAPL) announced its iPhone 16 and a number of other products during its annual fall launch event this week, generating a range of reactions as people voiced their thoughts on the new products and features.\nOne feature that generated excitement and curiosity was the iPhone 16's \"camera control\" button, which will let users open their camera from the lock screen. When the phone is taking landscape photos, the button\u2014around the area where a shutter button would be on a traditional camera\u2014will make it easier to take pictures with keep both hands on the phone to keep it stable.\nOthers were excited about the artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities Apple showcased during the event. Its \"Visual Intelligence\" demo seemed to rival Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Lens, which can translate text and perform Google searches just by taking a picture of something in front of the user.\nSome, like YouTube tech reviewer Marques Brownlee, said it was becoming more difficult for him to associate the iPhone 16 with Apple's AI features, given that the phone is launching Sept. 20, with none of the much-hyped AI features accessible. Visually and in terms of the technological hardware, Brownlee said, the iPhone 16 represents a \"very incremental, minor update\" to last year's iPhone 15.\nApple said that many AI features will roll out in iOS software updates starting next month for U.S. English users, and over the next year for other English-speaking areas and a number of other languages.\nThe event also sparked a number of jokes about how visually similar the new iPhones are to recent models.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%\u200b. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The stock has been hit in recent days following reports that the pre-orders for the much-awaited iPhone 16 series have been below analyst expectations and are down more than 10% compared to pre-orders for the previous version of the phone. According to reports, 37 million units of the new iPhone have been ordered, and one of the main reasons behind the slowdown in orders has been the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro. In the Pro version of the new iPhone, Apple Intelligence, the AI-powered features of the new Apple software, are not available at launch. China competition has also impacted iPhone sales.\nWhen it comes to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Wall Street analysts have bullish views. Investment advisory Loop Capital has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $300, implying upside potential of a handsome 32%. In a recent investor note, data cited by Loop Capital supply chain analyst John Donovan suggested that iPhone shipments for the September quarter were above market expectations.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Will Alphabet Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) market capitalization briefly eclipsed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) several times over the past decade. But the last time Alphabet was more valuable than Apple was on Jan. 29, 2019, when Alphabet was worth $744 billion and Apple was worth $729 billion.\nAlphabet is worth $1.97 trillion today while Apple is worth $3.3 trillion. Apple is now the world's most valuable publicly traded company, while Alphabet ranks fourth on that list. Both tech titans have generated big multibagger gains, but could Alphabet perk up again and overtake Apple by 2025?\nAlphabet's Google and Apple own the world's two largest mobile operating systems, but their business models are different. Alphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising ecosystem, which includes its search and display ads, advertising network, and YouTube. It generates less revenue from its cloud, hardware, and subscription segments.\nApple generates about half of its revenue from the iPhone, while more than a quarter comes from the services segment, which houses its App Store and subscription services. The rest comes from its Macs, iPads, and other products.\nFrom fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), Apple's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% as its earnings per share (EPS) rose at a CAGR of 16%. It experienced a major growth spurt in fiscal 2021 as it launched its first 5G iPhones, but its revenue slipped in fiscal 2023 when that 5G upgrade cycle ended, the Chinese market cooled off, and the pandemic-induced tailwinds for its Macs and iPads dissipated.\nFrom 2018 to 2023, Alphabet's revenue increased at a CAGR of 18% as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 22%. Its ad sales cooled off during the pandemic, but it offset that pressure by growing its cloud business. Its ad business subsequently recovered, but it slowed down again over the past year amid inflation, high interest rates, and other macro headwinds.\nBoth companies are ramping up their investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Apple is integrating \"Apple Intelligence\" into its services to write and summarize messages, search photos and videos, and create images from text prompts. Alphabet has gradually been expanding its Gemini platform to handle more generative AI tasks.\nApple and Alphabet both returned a lot of cash to their investors as they expanded. Over the past five years, Apple bought back 14% of its shares as Alphabet reduced its outstanding share count by 11%. Apple also continued to raise its dividend annually, while Alphabet initiated its first-ever dividend earlier this year.\nApple is growing at a slower rate than Alphabet, but it generated bigger gains over the past five years for three simple reasons. First, Apple's premium appeal, pricing power, and low exposure to the advertising market insulated it from a lot of the macro headwinds for consumer spending. Google's advertising business was more exposed to those economic challenges.\nSecond, Alphabet faces more long-term threats than Apple. Google is struggling to keep pace with OpenAI and Microsoft in the AI market, and OpenAI's new ChatGPT search engine could challenge its core search engine. Google Cloud also ranks a distant third behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure in the cloud infrastructure race.\nLastly, both companies are being scrutinized by regulators, but Alphabet arguably faces more near-term pressure. The U.S. Department of Justice recently ruled that Google had illegally monopolized the online search and advertising markets -- and it could either break up the tech giant or force it to share more of its data with its competitors. Those threats are likely compressing Alphabet's valuations and making it less appealing than Apple.\nAlphabet trades at just 18 times forward earnings, making it the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Apple looks a lot pricier at 28 times forward earnings.\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Alphabet's EPS to grow at a CAGR of 20%. If it matches those estimates and maintains the same valuations, its stock could rise about 13% to $180 by 2025. That would boost its market cap to about $2.2 trillion.\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, Wall Street expects Apple's EPS to increase at a CAGR of just 11%. If it meets those expectations and maintains its premium valuation, its stock could rise about 8% to $234 and boost its market cap to $3.6 trillion by 2025. But if it trades at the same forward multiple of 18 as Alphabet, Apple's stock price would actually decline about 30% to $150 and reduce its market cap to $2.3 trillion.\nSo for now, it seems unlikely that Alphabet's market cap can surpass Apple's by 2025. But if Alphabet overcomes its near-term threats, it might just command a higher valuation and generate bigger gains than Apple over the next year. As for Apple, it will need to dazzle its investors with new products and services to support its higher valuation.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other big company stocks.\nMega-cap stocks\u2014major technology companies to be precise\u2014continued to drive a disproportionate share of the total US stock market returns. Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500\u2019s 40%+ gain.\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies\u2019 stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks. \u00a0Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\nOur methodology \nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries.

Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best big company stocks to buy.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed\u2019s ability to adjust rates.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

The company debuted the much-hyped iPhone 16 models earlier this week, launching the new models with Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that the firm hopes will result in a stronger upcycle for the new phones. Apple Intelligence will be available on new iPhones by this October. Some AI features of the new product include letting users create new emoji by typing a description of what they want, or pulling photos and movies automatically to create a storyline. Other examples include letting Siri automatically delete duplicate photos or updating contact information, adding photos to an album or more.\nIn an investor note, analyst Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs had earlier pointed out that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock had historically underperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 70 bps on the day of the iPhone announcement. Ng backed the event this year expect to be similarly immaterial to the stock price. However, Ng acknowledged that some surprises might still have an impact on the share price, including a price increase in new iPhone models and the debut of some earlier-than-expected AI features.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner.\u00a0Since Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBrad Gerstner, the founder of\u00a0Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\u201cSince 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it\u2019s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,\u201d Gerstner said.\nGerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.\n\u201cAs a professional investor, we\u2019re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,\u201d he said.\nFor this article we scanned Altimeter Capital\u2019s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nBrad Gerstner\u2019s Stake: $57,155,950\nTalking to CNBC in June, Brad Gerstner said:\n\u201cClearly, Apple with a billion users is going to play a significant role in introducing AI to the masses. And part of the reason we like Apple is only 5% of Apple users today can access Apple Intelligence so they are going to have to upgrade these devices in order to play.\u201d\nHowever, initial numbers on Apple\u2019s new iPhone are not encouraging. Shipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n\u201cWait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,\u201d said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. \u201cOn average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.\u201d\nIn the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they\u2019re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\nHowever, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but\nOverall, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner.

        "Text": "Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has seen a nice run-up this year. Shares have risen more than 15% year to date as of this writing. Bidding up the stock in 2024, investors seem convinced the company could benefit from its innovations in artificial intelligence (AI).\nWhile the iPhone maker might see a solid upgrade cycle for its new iPhones this year thanks to AI, this doesn't automatically make the stock a buy. Valuation matters, too -- and the stock's valuation is looking quite pricey. Of course, that doesn't necessarily make the stock a sell, either. Indeed, if I had to categorize the stock as either a buy, sell, or hold, I'd probably call it a hold.\nThere's no denying that Apple sets a high standard in business. On its approximately $386 billion in trailing-12-month revenue,\u00a0for instance, the company generated an astounding $104 billion in free cash flow. This, combined with the company's war chest of cash ($153 billion at the end of its most recent quarter), enabled it to buy back an incredible $96 billion worth of its own stock over this same period. And this is on top of the $15.1 billion it spent on dividends. Extraordinary!\nPowering these impressive financials is an integrated ecosystem of hardware, software, and services its customers love. Apple's loyal customer base means the company can charge high prices relative to its product costs, evidenced by its trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 46%.\nEven more, while Apple's iPhone sales may be its bread and butter and its various products may be what the company is best known for, its services business is growing faster than its overall business and boasts a gross profit margin of 74%.\nDriven primarily by App Store sales and subscriptions and the company's ever-expanding suite of native services, like Apple TV, AppleCare, iCloud storage, and Apple Pay, this lucrative segment will likely grow as a percentage of revenue over the long haul, making the company even more profitable. This segment will likely provide the tech company with an engine for sustainable long-term growth.\nDespite all of these amazing facets of Apple's business, there are two reasons investors should be cautious about buying the stock today.\nFirst, Apple isn't the fast-growing company it used to be. Total revenue rose 5% year over year in its most recent quarter. Sure, earnings per share rose 11% year over year with the help of margin expansion and share repurchases, but such low top-line growth is still a cause for concern.\nSecond, Apple stock's price-to-earnings ratio of about 34 today arguably already prices in strong growth for years to come. Even if the tech company continues growing its top line at current rates for the next decade, shareholder returns may be underwhelming at this valuation.\nStill, given how great Apple's business is, shares are probably more of a hold than a sell today. After all, a quality business like this is probably more likely to surprise to the upside than the downside.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Martin Baccardax ",
        "Text": "Apple shares edged higher in early Wednesday trading, with the stock pinned near the lowest levels in a month, after a top Wall Street analyst pointed to an impending multiyear cycle of iPhone upgrades tied to the tech giant's AI push.\nApple\u00a0 (AAPL) \u00a0shares have been under pressure for much of the past month, and have extended declines since the iPhone 16 launched Sept. 10, amid concern that the slow rollout of AI-powered features on the flagship device would blunt demand for new purchases and upgrades.\nReports of quicker lead times for new iPhone 16 orders, which can be a good proxy for measuring the balance between Apple's supply plans and consumer demand, have also suggested muted early uptake for the new handsets, which went on general sale this week and are priced largely in line with last year's models.\nTaiwan-based Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported earlier this week that Apple sold an estimated 37 million new iPhone 16 units in its opening weekend, down around 12.7% from the first days after last year's iPhone 15 launch.\nDemand for the new iPhone series could prove crucial for the broader AI-investment thesis, as Apple is seen as the best-placed tech group to deliver the new technology at the consumer-facing level through its 1.4 billion user base.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring, however, says iPhone lead times don't carry the predictive power that investors sometimes assume, and he continues to see a big uptick in demand over the near term.\n\"Historically, first-two-week lead times are directionally predictive of next-12-month shipments at the model level, but they don't provide much insight into December-quarter iPhone build revisions or total iPhone shipments,\" Woodring said in a note published Tuesday.\nRelated: Apple stock slides as big iPhone 16 bet sputters\nWoodring reiterated his 'buy' rating and $273 price target on Apple stock, a level that suggests 26% upside for Apple over the next 12 months.\n\"What\u2019s more important is how iPhone 16 lead times trend over the next 10 days,\" he added. \"We see near-term stock downside to $200, which we'd be buyers of, given that the multiyear upgrade cycle is a 'when, not an if,'\" he added.\nCFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino also argues that early iPhone lead times aren't a reliable indicator of demand, noting the small sample size and time horizon that could skew the dataset.\nZino sees \"mid-to-high-single-digit percentage growth\" in iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 sales. But he says the uptake will \"not be a super cycle\" but rather an \"evolutionary one that will take several cycles to witness the true benefits.\"\nRelated: Huawei answers Apple's iPhone 16 with the first trifold phone\n\"We are disappointed by the lack of high-end pricing changes and limited AI-rollout details while we await how aggressive telcos will be with promotions.

        "Text": "TikTok will shut down its music streaming service beginning Nov. 28, just two years after parent company ByteDance aimed to compete with the likes of Spotify (SPOT) and Apple Music (AAPL).\nThe company is encouraging its users to utilize the \u201cAdd to Music App\u201d feature, which lets users save the songs they discover on TikTok to the music streaming services of their choice. Users were told to transfer playlists to other services no later than Oct. 28.\n\"We will be closing TikTok Music at the end of November in order to focus on our goal of furthering TikTok\u2019s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry,\" Ole Obermann, global head of music business development at TikTok, said in a statement.\nThe move represents a shift in strategy for the company, which no longer wants to compete with third-party streaming services. Instead, it wants to continue to partner with them.\nSpotify stock ticked higher following the news, closing up about 3% on Tuesday.\nByteDance first initiated talks with music labels to expand the music streaming service, originally dubbed Resso, in 2022. At the time, the goal was to utilize TikTok's ability to discover new music and make songs go viral.\nThe new platform, which signed licensing deals with major record labels, including Sony Music Entertainment (SONY), Warner Music Group (WMG), and Universal Music Group (UMG.AS), launched in July 2023 with a new name: TikTok Music. It was initially rolled out in Indonesia and Brazil before quickly entering markets including Australia, Mexico, and Singapore.\nBut the company has recently found itself in hot water with those labels over a variety of issues, from appropriate compensation for artists and songwriters to protections from artificial intelligence.\nEarlier this year, TikTok and Universal Music Group faced a monthslong dispute that eliminated the songs of top artists, including Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, and Adele, from the platform.\nThe dispute was eventually resolved in May, with the two sides signing an updated agreement that addressed some of the concerns.\nTikTok is currently at the center of a bipartisan political battle after President Biden signed new legislation that will ban the app in the US unless ByteDance divests its ownership stake.\nAfter filing a lawsuit to block the new legislation, TikTok argued its case in front of a federal appeals court last week. But if that fails, a ban could come as early as January 2025.\nAlexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Ryan Hogg ",
        "Text": "Ireland\u2019s \u20ac13 billion windfall from a European court tussle with Apple looks on the surface like a boost to the country\u2019s already-inflated coffers. But in reality, it has created a new headache for an economy with more money than sense.\nOn Monday, the EU ruled Apple had to pay Ireland \u20ac13 billion in unpaid taxes, concluding an eight-year battle for the bloc that received little help from Ireland.\nThe money adds to Ireland\u2019s substantial government surplus without leaving it any nearer to figuring out how it could spend those funds and what it means for the country\u2019s deeply entrenched relationship with U.S. tech giants.\nIreland attracted many tech companies at the start of the century after the country lowered its corporation tax rate to 12.5%.\nAfter being hobbled by the Global Financial Crisis and receiving \u20ac67.5 billion in loans from the EU, the country doubled down on attractive incentives for tech groups while enacting painful austerity measures on its citizens.\nThe investment created an economic windfall for Ireland that wasn\u2019t everything it appeared to be.\nIrish GDP grew by more than 26% in 2016 after Apple restructured to place patents and intellectual property in the country, leading Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Paul Krugman to label the growth figures \u201cLeprechaun Economics.\u201d\nThe country\u2019s statistics organization had to create a new measure of economic growth as a result of the inflated accounts of tech groups in the country, which were paying minimal taxes.\nThe Central Statistics Office introduced modified gross national income, which, among other things, removes the net factor income of re-domiciled public companies, including Apple and Google.\nIn 2023, Irish modified GNI (gross national income) was just 55% of its \u20ac510 billion GDP output.\nStill, the country\u2019s government has praised the tech windfall\u2019s economic benefits, notably infrastructure improvements in Ireland and high-value job creation.\nBut the country\u2019s tech ecosystem is facing a reckoning.\nThe EU\u2019s ruling against Apple was a landmark judgment following a battle that whirred from 2016, when Apple\u2019s contributions to the Irish economy came into focus.\nIreland spent \u20ac10 million in government funds on legal fees defending Apple\u2019s tax situation in the country before the EU ruled against the tech giant.\nMeanwhile, the country doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with the economic benefits it has gained from its past special relationship with U.S. tech.\nBefore the EU court ruled against Ireland, the country was already trying to figure out what to do with a mammoth \u20ac8.6 billion surplus.\nThe Irish government has plenty of pain points that could do with a multibillion-euro injection. The Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il coalition also has the incentive of an election due next year to woo voters. But the figures are eye-watering even for Ireland\u2019s inflated coffers, as are the timelines for improvement.\nAn all-island rail review, which includes neighboring Northern Ireland, says a \u20ac37 billion investment was required over 25 years to update the island\u2019s network.\nThe country also needs to unleash a major housebuilding project, as four people are born for every new home built in the country, and affordability has declined faster than in many major economies like the U.S. and the U.K.\nThe main Irish opposition party, Sinn F\u00e9in, has pledged \u20ac39 billion to a housing plan if it is elected next year.\nDetractors have argued that a spending spree risks overheating an economy still trying to recover from generationally high inflation. Others have argued the funds should be set aside for a rainy day when it is urgently needed, with the nearly \u20ac70 billion of state aid in 2010 still fresh in policymakers\u2019 minds.\nIreland announced last year the creation of a sovereign wealth fund, \u00e0 la Norway, which was expected to grow to more than \u20ac100 billion by the mid-2030s. Ireland intends to reinvest its vast economic reserves in future pension provisions and long-term infrastructure needs.\nDanny McCoy, the CEO of Ibec, Ireland\u2019s main business lobby, warns that future business growth is a risk to Ireland, but he argues that this only increases the urgency to invest now.\n\u201cIbec and our members are extremely optimistic about the resources available to the next government and what can be achieved,\u201d McCoy wrote.\n\u201cHowever, it is conceivable that future governments may not have the same level of resources available as the next one. Therefore, now is the time to address the challenges that have been the Achilles\u2019 heel of growth, such as the long and drawn-out nature of infrastructure delivery, poor public services, and housing issues.\u201d\nThe Apple issue also weighs on Ireland\u2019s mind. The Financial Times reported that other European countries with an interest in Apple may stake a claim to the tax judgment brought by the EU.\nIt may raise questions about Ireland\u2019s tax arrangements with other U.S. tech companies, particularly Google.\nThe Irish government has vast levels of corporation tax in part to thank for its huge surplus, which has been growing for the past few years. The government argues this is volatile and unlikely to grow at its previous pace. That decline could be expedited by wary multinationals.\nThe Irish government hasn\u2019t opposed the EU\u2019s ruling, and has pointed out it is only of historical significance as its current tax policies fall in line with the bloc\u2019s requirements.\nThe government may grumble behind the scenes at the potential Pyrrhic victory of a \u20ac13 billion windfall that reminds tech giants that Ireland isn\u2019t the tax haven it once was for the past two decades.\nHowever, there is also an argument that the longer Ireland puts off much-needed infrastructure developments, the less attractive it becomes as a hub for companies looking for sustainable growth in the country.\n\u201cThe biggest risk to multinationals now in Ireland, is they leave because our transport infrastructure and housing costs are so abysmal,\u201d Irish economist David McWilliams said on his podcast.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Forget Apple: Billionaires Are Buying Up This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch ",
        "Text": "With a market cap of over $3.3 trillion, Apple is the world's largest public company.\nYet, it's time for investors to forget it. Well, not literally \u2014 just figuratively.\nThat's because, while billionaires like Warren Buffett have been selling shares of Apple, several other famous billionaires have been stocking up on a different stock: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\nHere's what's happening and what it means for investors.\nEvery three months, large investment managers, hedge funds, and company insiders are required to file 13F forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These forms disclose what stocks are held, thus providing the public with a glimpse behind the curtain to see which stocks prominent billionaires are buying and selling.\nLast month, the most recent 13F filings were released, with data from the three months ending on June 30, 2024. And it revealed that several well-known billionaires are adding to their positions in Amazon.\nFor example, Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund run by billionaire Ray Dalio, purchased more than 1.6 million shares of Amazon. That more than doubled the fund's total holdings of Amazon to some 2.65 million shares, worth roughly $500 million.\nWhat's more, Citadel Advisors, the hedge fund run by billionaire Ken Griffin, increased its holdings of Amazon by around 1.1 million shares. It now controls about 7.7 million shares, valued at almost $1.5 billion.\nAll this buying begs the question: \"Why are billionaires racing to buy up shares of Amazon?\"\nFirst off, let's remember that 13F disclosures are not a perfect indication of how billionaires really think. For one thing, they're a snapshot. Funds may have already reduced or sold out of stock positions before their 13Fs are even made public.\nSecond, funds are only forced to disclose their long positions, not their short positions. Therefore, it's difficult to know a fund manager's true intentions. Are they really bullish on a given stock, or is their big new position just a hedge? There's no way to know for sure.\nHowever, assuming that the Amazon positions are bullish bets, what are the reasons for being bullish on Amazon right now?\nI can think of more than a few. But let's focus on the company's impressive growth.\nDespite already generating well over $500 billion in annual sales, Amazon continues to increase its sales at a breakneck pace. In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on June 30, 2024), the company reported revenue growth of 10%.\nAt that pace, the company may add close to $50 billion to its sales total over the next 12 months. For context, that's the same amount of annual sales generated by Nike, a titan within the sports apparel industry and an iconic American company for more than four decades. In other words, Amazon's revenue is so big and growing so fast, that its growth alone is equivalent to adding a company like Nike \u2014 every year.\nAmazon remains a wonderful company. It has both the world's largest e-commerce business and the largest cloud-services business (Amazon Web Services). Furthermore, it continues to innovate in new and exciting fields, like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).\nTo sum up, it can be hard to really understand what billionaires are thinking (despite what their 13F filings reveal). Nevertheless, Amazon stock remains a buy now thanks to its excellent fundamentals and solid prospects for the future.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has moved back into the top spot as the largest company in the world by market cap. It's gone through some stunning ups and downs, but if you'd bought shares at the initial public offering (IPO) back in 1980 and held on, you'd have a lot more shares, and a lot of money. Let's see just how much.\nApple went public in December 1980 at $22 per share. Like pretty much any stock over a nearly 45-year period, Apple stock has climbed and crashed several times. For example, it lost 21% of its value between 1989 and 1996 -- a long period for an investor to hold on to a stock that's losing. But if you did, you'd have quite a windfall today.\nSince that time, Apple has developed an incredible tech platform with a strong moat in its differentiated systems and applications. It has a strong, loyal fan base that only buys Apple products and consistently moves up to new drops and launches. Just this week Apple released its latest software update, iOS18, with a swarm of new upgrades and features. It's also investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to stay competitive in the tech race.\nThat's why Apple stock has skyrocketed over time and gone through five stock splits: three 2-for-1 stock splits in 1987, 2000, and 2005; a 7-for-1 split in 2014; and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Each IPO share would have been worth $0.10 split adjusted, and you'd own 224 shares today. At today's prices, that's worth $48,455.\nIn short, the stock has appreciated more than 2,200 times since its IPO. For further perspective, if you had instead invested $1,000 in the stock at its IPO, your investment would've been worth $2.2 million today, excluding the dividends that were paid to you over the years.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $715,640!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": " Karen Friar   ,  Hamza Shaban    and  Josh Schafer    ",
        "Text": "Stocks traded mixed on Monday, with tech names struggling ahead of a crucial week dominated by expectations for the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate cut in four years.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell about 0.5%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%, after strong weekly wins for the major stock gauges. A 6% surge in Intel (INTC) stock helped push the Dow to a record high close of 41,622.08.\nElsewhere, techs were under pressure as Apple (AAPL) shares lost ground amid concerns about iPhone 16 sales. The megacap's stock was down about 3% following analysts' findings that early demand for the recently updated smartphone is lagging 2023 levels.\nMore broadly, stocks are diverging amid rising bets that the Fed will opt for a more drastic 50 basis point cut in its monetary policy decision on Wednesday at the end of its two-day meeting.\nThe central bank is almost universally expected to bring in the first US rate cut in four years \u2014 a significant policy shift and an official end to a years-long tightening campaign designed to tamp down inflation.\nRead more: Fed predictions for 2024: What experts say about the possibility of a rate cut\nThat conviction has put investors on edge over how aggressively the Fed will lower rates, whether by 0.5% or 0.25%. A half-point move would aim to protect the labor market and reduce the risk of recession but would also risk spooking investors by signaling a dire economic outlook.\nAs of Monday, traders are pricing in a 63% chance of an outsized move, compared with 30% a week ago. The odds of a 25 basis point cut stand at 37%, per the CME FedWatch tool.\nIn other corporate news, Boeing (BA) shares were down about 1% and touched a 52-week trading low as the plane-maker implements a hiring freeze and is considering temporary furloughs amid a major strike of 33,000 of its factory workers, which began last week.\nA 6% surge in Intel (INTC) stock helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) to a record high close of 41,622.08.\nIntel (INTC) stock popped after the Biden Administration awarded Intel $3 billion for national security-related chip production. After the closing bell, Intel's shares rose another 9% following news the chip manufacturer is extending collaboration with AWS.\nThe company said in a release it will produce an AI fabric chip for AWS.\nBelow is a look at how all 30 of the Dow components performed on Monday as the index pushed to a record high.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) shares were roughly flat as the company announced its piling more more of its AI-powered Copilot technology into its Microsoft 365 productivity products, including Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams.\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\nThe updates, which include the ability to use Copilot to draft PowerPoint presentations and a feature that prioritizes your emails in Outlook, are a part of what the tech giant refers to as its Copilot Wave 2 rollout.\nIn addition to the improvements to its Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft also announced a new collaborative tool called Copilot Pages, which lets teams of workers access, edit, and manipulate data on a single page using information pulled from Copilot.\nThe company also debuted a new agent builder option that lets users easily create Copilot-powered agents, AI assistants designed to automate and executive business processes.\nThe moves are all a part of Microsoft\u2019s broader efforts to infuse its vast portfolio of business software products with AI capabilities as it seeks to outpace rivals in the space, ranging from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Salesforce (CRM), and monetize its enormous investments in AI technology.\nMicrosoft says the number of customers using Copilot increased more than 60% quarter over quarter and that the number of people who use it daily at work doubled. What\u2019s more, the Windows maker says Vodafone is purchasing 68,000 Copilot licenses for its 100,000 employees after it found that the software helped workers save an average of three hours per week per person.\nThe new Copilot features for Microsoft\u2019s 365 apps are all designed to help improve worker efficiency, whether that means tracking meeting transcripts and chats to make it easier to catch up or quickly adding references to documents, PDFs, and emails in a Word document.\nAfter reports of the death of the classic diversified 60-40 portfolio in 2023, the strategy is officially back in 2024.\nBloomberg's global 60/40 index, which tracks a global portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, closed last week at fresh all-time weekly high. And, as seen in our chart of the day, the index has been ripping for most of 2024.\nCharles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out in an X post on Monday that Bloomberg's aggregate total return bond index is up more than 10% over the past 12 months, marking one of the index's highest yearly returns in the past 20 years. \nPerhaps this is another sign that it's more than just AI stocks working at this stage of the bull market.\nThe debate about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points or 50 basis points continues to heat up.\nThere's been a prevailing thought over the past month, which we've noted before, that if the central bank does opt for the larger of the two interest rate cut scenarios, it could prompt panic in markets. \nBut markets are all about expectations. Panic usually comes when something unexpected happens. As of Monday, markets were pricing in a 59% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point interest cut on Wednesday, per the CME FedWatch tool. \nSo if the market is pricing in a 50 basis point interest rate cut, it's hard to argue that's going to spring outright panic.\n\"I think the Fed would be reluctant to surprise the market,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti told Yahoo Finance.\nAnd, in fact, since the market is already leaning toward a 50 basis point cut on Wednesday, one could argue the Fed would actually be tightening policy by only slashing rates by 25 basis points.\n\"Unless something changes, going 25 will tighten financial market conditions, pushing interest rates up,\" Renaissance Macro's head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Monday morning. \"Monetary policy works through the financial markets. Tighter financial conditions should be avoided when the balance of risks between growth and inflation have shifted as they have now. If the downside risks to employment outweigh the upside risks to inflation, then the Fed should be leaning against tightening financial conditions, all else equal.\"\nThe White House Monday said an \u201cimportant turning point\u201d has been reached in the three-year battle against the surge in inflation and that it\u2019s important to protect progress in the job market.\n\u201cInflation is coming back down close to normal levels, and it is important to safeguard the important labor market progress we have made,\u201d Lael Brainard, director of President Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, said in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations.\nHer comments come as the Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates this week for the first time in four years, as officials have declared they\u2019ve gained confidence inflation is coming back down to their 2% target and that attention is shifting to a cooling labor market.\nFed Chair Jay Powell said in his last speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in late August that the Fed \u201cwill do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability.\u201d He noted that the Fed does not \"seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions\" and that the current level of the policy rate gives the Fed \u201cample room\u201d to lower rates in response to any weakening in the job market.\nBrainard said the administration\u2019s policies to assist in supply chain bottlenecks and address commodities price spikes, coupled with a commitment to respect the Fed\u2019s independence, has helped bring inflation back down.\n\u201cThis was an important contrast to [Biden\u2019s] predecessor, who repeatedly criticized Federal Reserve monetary policy during the previous administration,\u201d Brainard said.\nBrainard underscored the administration\u2019s policies and work to address affordability challenges, including housing by building millions of new affordable homes and providing incentives for states and localities to remove outdated obstacles to building. She also emphasized the importance of expanding the labor force by subsidizing costly childcare and investing in clean energy, semiconductors, and AI to create jobs.\n\"This is very different from an approach that would weaken our economy by undermining the independence of the Federal Reserve and the rule of law, add trillions to the debt, and impose what amounts to a sales tax of $4,000 on middle-class families,\u201d she said.\nStocks continued to send mixed signals on Monday afternoon as tech names struggled ahead of a major Fed decision on interest rate cuts.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.8%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%. Last week, the major gauges posted strong weekly wins. But investors this week are preoccupied with the Fed's upcoming decision to lower interest rates, with uncertainty over how large the cut will be.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during morning trading on Monday:\nApple (AAPL): Shares of the tech giant slid more than 2% in morning trading Monday following a burst of analyst reports that suggested early demand for Cupertino's latest smartphone, iPhone 16, is lagging behind the release of last year's model around the same time period.\nIntel (INTC): Shares of the technology company rose Monday morning following a Bloomberg report that the chip giant will receive up to $3.5 billion in funding to make chips for the Defense Department. This would be in addition to the billions the company was awarded under the Chips and Science Act.\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT, DJTWW): Shares of Trump's media company moved lower during morning trading after reports of a second assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. The Republican presidential candidate confirmed he is \"safe\" in a campaign email. The FBI is conducting an investigation while the suspected gunman is now in custody.\nBausch + Lomb (BLCO (BLCO): Shares of the eye-care company rose more than 4% following a report that it is considering a sale to disentangle itself from its parent company. The Financial Times reported on Friday that Bausch + Lomb is working with Goldman Sachs to search for potential buyers and gauge interest. Parent company Bausch Health owns the majority of Bausch + Lomb's shares.\nWedbush has adjusted its outlook on Zillow (Z), increasing the price target to $80 from the previous $50, and upgrading its rating on the stock to Outperform from Neutral.\nShares were up more than 3% Monday morning.\nThe analyst, Jay McCanless, in a research note attributed his increased confidence to lower mortgage rates providing a \u201cpositive catalyst\u201d for Zillow\u2019s core brokerage business.\nMortgage rates have slid in recent months, hitting their lowest level in over a year as investors anticipate rate cuts from the Fed this month. The central bank will issue its next policy decision on Wednesday.\nAnd there\u2019s also potential for further declines as the Fed prepares to start a new cycle of interest rate cuts this week, which could continue into next year. Lower borrowing costs would help with affordability.\nAdditionally, according to McCanless, the company\u2019s software and services offerings, a segment of Zillow\u2019s residential division, \"have enabled total revenue to grow at a pace surpassing the national existing home market for several quarters.\"\nMcCanless raised his fiscal 2025 revenue growth forecast for the residential segment to 17% from 12.5% and doubled his rental revenue growth estimate to 10% from 5%, citing new apartment construction.\nWhen the Federal Reserve meets Wednesday, officials are expected to mark the end of an era as they cut interest rates for the first time in four years and chart a course for lower rates over the next two years, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger.\n\u201cThis is a big meeting,\u201d said former Kansas City Fed president Esther George. \u201cIt\u2019s one that\u2019s been foreshadowed since late last year. It\u2019s long been expected.\u201d\nThe central bank is expected to lower rates by a quarter percentage point to a new range of 5.0%-5.25% from its 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% on Wednesday when the policy meeting concludes. The actions will officially mark the termination of the most aggressive inflation-fighting campaign since the 1980s.\nInvestors' bets on how deeply the Fed will cut rates for the first time have been fluctuating widely. As of Monday morning, traders were pricing in a 61% chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, versus 39% for 25 basis points. The odds were split 50-50 on Friday, compared with an 85% backing for the smaller cut a week or so ago.\nThe rate cut will mark the first in a series of cuts, as the central bank's new era of easy money is expected to last through 2025 and 2026. That shift will ripple through the US economy by making it cheaper for Americans to borrow what they need to buy houses, cars, and credit card purchases.\nApple stock slid more than 2% in morning trading Monday following a burst of analyst reports that suggested early demand for the company's latest smartphone, iPhone 16, is lagging behind the release of last year's model around the same time period.\nThe Street reported findings from Citigroup, Jefferies, and TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that indicated demand for the AI-capable phone is softer than 2023 levels.\nKuo, who has accurately predicted Apple's moves in the past, estimated the first weekend of preorder sales for the iPhone 16 brought in about 37 million units, down nearly 13% from the equivalent weekend of last year's iPhone 15 sales debut. \"The key factor is the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series.\" he wrote in a post on Monday.\nEarlier this year, Kuo authored a report saying iPhone shipments will decline as much as 15% year over year in 2024, owing to a drop in iPhone sales in China coupled with the emergence of generative AI-powered and foldable smartphones, which will put pressure on iPhone sales throughout the year.\nMeanwhile, Jefferies noted that some iPhone 16 models are available for store pickup almost immediately, suggesting softer consumer interest. And Citi pointed to intensifying competition in China and upgrade fatigue as among the factors explaining the weaker demand.\nApple's newest iPhone model is a key component in the company's AI strategy, which centers on bringing powerful and intuitive new use cases to everyday users. Apple touts its AI platform, Apple Intelligence, as one of the main selling points for its latest phones, as its software will only run on last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro or newer models.\nAnalysts are banking on that upgrade incentive to reinvigorate iPhone sales and push the stock's value higher.\nStocks traded mixed on Monday, with tech names struggling ahead of a crucial week dominated by expectations for the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut in four years.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed after strong weekly wins for the major stock gauges.\n"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other safe stocks to invest in.\nA probable rate cut has provided hope for the economy. Despite that, the impact on financial markets and stocks remains uncertain. On September 4, Adam Parker, Trivariate Research founder and CEO, appeared in an\u00a0interview\u00a0on\u00a0CNBC.\u00a0Parker was not surprised that tech stocks were down by close to 4% at the beginning of September, that too right before an impending rate cut. Parker highlights that the inconsistency in the market at the moment is not normal, and with multiple rate cuts over the next two years, he has no reason to hold a positive economic outlook. He suggests that eight probable rate cuts indicate that the economy is slowing, consumer spending is declining, and unemployment is rising, all of which are not good signs for the market. The interviewer counter questions that eight rate cuts with a 25 basis point reduction are not as disastrous to presume a faltering economy. Parker then highlights that rate cuts in the past have been supported by consistent data, an incremental fiscal, and an expansion of the balance sheet, all of which are currently out of the picture. You can also read our piece on the\u00a0best battery stocks to buy according to short sellers.\nOn September 2, CNBC published a detailed report on the impact of rate cuts on the stock market in the United States. The Fed, in the footsteps of countries in Europe and Asia, recently announced an easing cycle, after a long period of high interest rates. As per current pricing data, the Fed is expected to have three 25-basis point cuts by the end of this year. Speaking of the global economic outlook, 2025 will see a lower-rate environment followed by easing inflationary pressures. However, the fear of recession in the United States tells another story. Analysts believe that the last four months of 2024 will be considerably weak and choppy amid geopolitical factors, uncertainty from the AI sector, corporate earnings, and most importantly, an overdue consolidation correction.\nOn September 3, JP Morgan reported that investors must not expect the cutting cycle to provide a fresh start to stocks. Leading strategists at the firm suggested that the rate cut cycle is rather reactive and is in response to a wilting economy, having little to no impact on stocks. Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy, on the other hand, suggested that the market environment today resembles the market in 1995, increasing hopes for a market upside amid stable GDP strength and forecasts.\nBear market or bull market, certain stocks deserve a place in every investor\u2019s portfolio. These are long-term opportunities to hold and will continue to provide superior returns, as they have for decades.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 safe stocks to invest in now, we looked for well-established companies in the energy, finance, healthcare, technology, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries. These stocks have a history of performing well and boasting consistent financial results, making them ideal and safe long term investments for beginners. We then picked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by money managers and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the safest stocks to invest in. Apple is the company behind the iPhone, used by a vast majority across the globe, accounting for 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models and Apple is on the cusp of an iPhone upgrade super cycle. The new feature aims to dramatically enhance a user\u2019s experience across all Apple devices.\nIn the FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple\u2019s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 12% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion.\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion.\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024\u00a0investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall APPL ranks 4th among the safe stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of APPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "JPMorgan JPM is in discussions with Apple Inc. AAPL regarding a credit card partnership to replace Goldman Sachs GS. This was first reported by Wall Street Journal, citing a source familiar with the matter.\nIn 2019, Goldman partnered with Apple as it entered into the credit card space to issue Apple credit cards. However, it began pulling back last year due to significant losses in its consumer division.\u00a0In early 2023, GS informed Apple of its intention to offload the partnership due to financial strains and in November, Apple reportedly proposed an exit from its credit card contract within the next 12 to 15 months. This paved the way for potential new partners to take over the Apple credit card program.In December 2023, JPM was reportedly being considered a natural successor to take over the Apple credit card program given the existing relationship between the two entities. The two entities already had ties via Apple Pay, and JPMorgan was one of the largest partners for transactions at Apple retail outlets.Earlier this year, AAPL and JPMorgan initiated discussions to consider the possibility of the bank becoming the new issuer of the Apple Card.\nAs reported by Wall Street Journal, the discussions have advanced in recent weeks, However, there\u2019s no certainty that an agreement will be formed.JPM is negotiating for better terms, as it seeks to pay less than the full value for roughly $17 billion outstanding balances in the Apple Card program due to higher losses on the cards. Sources close to Goldman contended that higher-than-average delinquencies and defaults on the Apple Card portfolio were majorly owed to the new user accounts.Apple and Goldman offered cards to customers with weak credit scores in an attempt to boost their revenues, which resulted in increased subprime exposure and terms that could be costly for any issuer. This has further complicated the negotiations.Also, JPM is in talks regarding amendments to some parts of the program, which includes Apple\u2019s calendar-based billing feature, which means that cardholders receive statements at the beginning of the month instead of staggered ones dispersed across the period. This feature, while appealing to customers, leads to a huge number of calls for the service personnel at the same time each month.These efforts align with JPM\u2019s aim to grow its presence in diverse sectors and strengthen its market share. Last week, it was reported that the company seeks to increase its corporate banking presence in the Swiss markets by utilizing its blockchain technology. It is currently in discussions with potential clients in Switzerland as the bank projects significant growth in its Swiss corporate banking division over the next three to five years. Similarly, earlier this month, JPM set up a private banking team in Dubai to offer wealth management services. This July, the company stated that it aims to capture 15% of the nation\u2019s consumer deposits.\nYear to date, shares of JPMorgan have gained 23% compared with the industry\u2019s 17.1% growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCurrently, JPM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Author": "  David Bartosiak ",
        "Text": "There\u2019s been a resurgence in AI names recently. There\u2019s also been a split between the haves and the have-nots. Look, I dare not call Apple (AAPL) a have-not, but in the grand scheme of the AI moves we\u2019ve seen, they are being left out of the party. The latest pre-order data for iPhone 16 is coming up somewhat lower than last year too. That\u2019s leading to some lagging when it comes to share price.\nAAPL has come down from over $230 at the end of August to the $216 level on Monday. It\u2019s looking overhead to its 50-dayh moving average and is under pressure. RSI has come down sharply, now at 40 and dropping as the selling continues. The now infamous August 5th bottom is at $196. The stock should tick up to fill the gap and retest the 50-day before it gets uglier. If it doesn\u2019t, then the 200-day and a retest of the lows could happen in short order.\nMoving Averages: Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.\nSupport and Resistance Levels: Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.\nChart Patterns: He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.\nVolume Analysis: He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.\nDave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Apple\u2019s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The Apple(NasdaqGS:AAPL) is currently navigating a complex environment marked by both growth and challenges. Recent developments include a record June quarter revenue of $85.8 billion and significant investments in AI technology, contrasted by a slight decline in iPhone and Wearables revenue and concerns over valuation. In the discussion that follows, we will explore Apple's financial health, key weaknesses, growth opportunities, and external threats to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's current business situation.\nClick here and access our complete analysis report to understand the dynamics of Apple.\nApple's financial health is highlighted by its impressive revenue growth and profitability. The company reported a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from the previous year. This growth was achieved across multiple markets, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Services revenue reached an all-time high of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year, showcasing the strength of Apple's diversified business model. Customer satisfaction remains exceptionally high, with the iPhone 15 family achieving a 98% satisfaction rate in the U.S. Moreover, Apple is trading at 5.3% below its estimated fair value of $240.26, suggesting potential for value appreciation despite a higher Price-To-Earnings Ratio compared to industry peers.To gain deeper insights into Apple's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.\nApple faces several challenges. The company's iPhone revenue decreased by 1% year-over-year to $39.3 billion, and revenue from Wearables, Home, and Accessories fell by 2% to $8.1 billion. Additionally, Apple's Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 33.9x is significantly higher than the Global Tech industry average of 21.4x, indicating that it might be overvalued compared to its peers. Gross margin pressure is also a concern, with the products gross margin dropping 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by product mix and partially offset by favorable costs. Furthermore, Apple's earnings growth over the past year (7.6%) did not outperform the Tech industry average of 31.4%.To dive deeper into how Apple's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of Apple's Valuation.\nApple has several opportunities to enhance its market position and capitalize on emerging trends. The company is making significant investments in Apple Intelligence, aiming to unlock the full potential of AI technology. New product launches, such as the all-new 11- and 13-inch iPad Air, demonstrate Apple's commitment to innovation. Expansion into emerging markets, including the opening of its first location in Malaysia, offers growth potential. Increased engagement in services is also notable, with both transacting and paid accounts reaching new all-time highs, growing double digits year-over-year. These strategic moves are expected to bolster Apple's competitive advantage and drive future growth.\nApple faces several external threats that could impact its long-term success. Currency fluctuations pose a significant risk, with a negative foreign exchange impact of 230 basis points already affecting revenue growth. The competitive environment, particularly in the global tech market, remains intense. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, such as ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Significant insider selling over the past three months also raises concerns about potential internal challenges. These factors highlight the need for Apple to navigate external pressures carefully to sustain its market leadership.\nApple's strong financial health, evidenced by its record revenue and high customer satisfaction, underscores its resilience and potential for value appreciation, especially as it trades 5.3% below its estimated fair value of $240.26. However, challenges such as declining iPhone and Wearables revenue, a higher Price-To-Earnings Ratio, and gross margin pressures indicate areas needing strategic focus. The company's investments in AI, new product launches, and expansion into emerging markets present significant opportunities for future growth. Nonetheless, external threats like currency fluctuations and intense competition necessitate careful navigation to maintain its market leadership and drive sustained success.\nIs Apple part of your asset mix?

        "Title": "Who's the Biggest Winner From Apple Intelligence? It's This AI Stock, Not Apple.",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled the latest steps in its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy on Monday with its \"Glowtime\" event focused on its iPhone 16 lineup, its first new phone launch since it introduced Apple Intelligence back in June.\nThe latest line of phones will all be compatible with the new generative AI features, scheduled to launch on iOS 18. Apple's rollout of the new phones and Apple Intelligence will be perhaps the biggest test of demand for generative AI technology yet.\nCloud infrastructure companies and start-ups have poured billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, buying Nvidia components and filling up data centers in order to create and run generative AI applications like ChatGPT, but so far, there hasn't been a significant business beyond increased demand for hardware components.\nThere isn't really a \"killer app\" based on generative AI, and generative AI-based software hasn't taken over the way some might have expected when ChatGPT was launched nearly two years ago. However, Apple has a better chance to change that than any company that has come before it as Apple Intelligence will come with generative AI writing tools like text rewrite, image generation, and Visual Intelligence, which allows users to get information just from a photo.\nIn other words, demand for the new crop of iPhones will be the biggest test yet for broader demand for generative AI and its marketability.\nHowever, Apple stock didn't get the boost from the news that some might have expected, finishing Monday essentially flat.\nWhile Apple shares were flat on the news, a key supplier jumped. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), which designs Apple's CPU architecture, surged on the presentation, finishing Monday's session up 7%.\nImportantly, Apple's new A18, which is powering the iPhone 16, will run on Arm's latest CPU architecture, the v9, which commands twice the royalties as the prior version, the v8.\nApple is also Arm's most valuable customer as the iPhone makes up roughly half of the company's revenue.\nOf course, Apple will benefit from strong sales of the iPhone 16, but, according to those numbers, Arm stands to be an even greater beneficiary if the new iPhones are a hit.\nIf iPhone 16 units increase 10% from the iPhone 15, Arm's royalties from the iPhone would jump 120% as royalty rates will have doubled from the year before. If iPhone sales make up half the company's royalty revenue, then that alone would drive royalty revenue up 60% even if the rest of the business is flat.\nArm dominates the market for smartphone CPU architecture with greater than 99% market share. That's largely due to its power-efficient architecture, which helps preserve battery life, but the company also sees an increasing opportunity in the data center from the AI boom as its Grace CPUs are also used by Nvidia in the Grace Hopper and upcoming Grace Blackwell Superchips.\nThe same advantage Arm has over x86-based competitors like Intel and AMD also applies to the data center as AI applications demand huge amounts of energy, and running them as efficiently as possible will help companies save money. In fact, Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson recently said, \"In our discussions with leading AI companies, they are telling us that reducing power-per-operation is now more important than increasing operations-per-second.\"\nIf Apple Intelligence does catch on, proving a larger market for AI devices, it could set off a supercycle of demand for Arm components in smartphones, the data center, PCs, and beyond.\nArm's momentum is already building with licensing revenue, a forerunner of royalties, up 72% in its most recent quarter. If the iPhone 16 takes off, Arm looks likely to cash in, and the stock has a ton of upside potential in AI beyond that.\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Romain Dillet ",
        "Text": "It was a matter of time, but Apple is going to allow third-party app stores on the iPad starting next week, on September 16. This change will occur with the next major release of iPadOS, the operating system specifically designed for the iPad.\nThe move is related to the European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a set of market fairness and pro-competition rules. Last fall, the Commission shared a list of six tech companies that have been designated \"gatekeepers,\" as they operate so-called \"core platform services\" (CPS). It has since added a seventh.\nFor Apple, the Commission initially designated three products and services as CPS: its mobile operating system iOS, its app distribution marketplace the App Store, and its web browser Safari. Then, in April, it announced that it was adding Apple\u2019s iPadOS to the list.\nWhile iPadOS user numbers did not meet the threshold to be in scope of the DMA, the Commission has some leeway in designations and said it considered that there are strong locked-in effects for business users in particular.\nApple had six months to update iPadOS and make sure that it is compliant with the DMA. Which brings us to Friday\u2019s announcement: Starting with iPadOS 18, users in the EU will be able to install alternative app stores. Similarly, web browser developers will be able to release browsers for the iPad with their own browser engines.\nGiven the different DMA compliance timeline for iOS, recent changes to iOS in the EU can be an indication of what\u2019s going to happen for iPad users in the EU.\nThere are five third-party app stores that are now available for iOS in the EU. One example, the AltStore PAL, was the first alternative app marketplace made available on iOS in the EU. You can use it to download video game emulator app Delta, virtual machine app UTM, torrenting app iTorrent, and more.\nApps are notarized by Apple for security purposes before they can be released on alternative app stores. App developers also have to sign new business terms with Apple -- and pay a controversial \u201cCore Technology Fee\u201d above a certain threshold.\nEpic Games also launched its alternative iOS app store in the EU so that people can download and play Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe, and Fall Guys on their iPhones. The company has already said that it plans to bring Fortnite and its other games to the iPad.\nAs for web browsers, while third-party browsers such as Chrome and Firefox have been available for a while, they all still use Apple\u2019s own browser engine WebKit to load web content. Tech companies haven\u2019t taken advantage of the DMA to release an EU-specific browser app for European users so far.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/alternative-app-stores-allowed-on-the-ipad-in-the-eu-starting-september-16/\n"

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shareholders are holding onto a successful iPhone 16 launch. Otherwise, the stock could be in trouble. Right now, Apple's stock trades at a premium price point despite its weak growth prospects, but the iPhone 16 could change all of that.\nHowever, Apple investors received concerning news about the iPhone 16, and it could spell disaster for the stock.\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo monitors several key Apple suppliers to gauge iPhone preorders. The iPhone 16 was announced last week, making this the first weekend of preorder data available, which is crucial in determining overall demand. The last few years have seen fairly weak iPhone demand, with sales barely moving from year to year. Unfortunately, for investors, that trend is starting to move in the wrong direction.\nAccording to Ming-Chi Kuo and his sources, iPhone preorders are down about 13% year over year. This is terrible news for Apple investors, as they needed a successful iPhone 16 launch to justify the stock's current price.\nSo it is time to panic-sell? Not necessarily.\nThere are a few factors at play. First, this is information from suppliers and could have errors. If this information came directly from Apple, then it would be a different story. Second, part of the draw of the new iPhone 16 is that it can run Apple Intelligence, Apple's take on generative AI. However, some of these features aren't expected to be available until October, after the iPhone 16 is available to the public.\nSo, there is still hope that the iPhone 16 will be a successful launch, and I'd caution investors to wait until this year's holiday season is complete before judging its success or failure.\nBut one thing isn't up for debate: Apple needs the iPhone 16 to be a success.\nApple is one of those stocks that is trading on its historically strong performance, not its current results. Since 2022, Apple has failed to post any meaningful revenue growth.\nBasically, Apple's revenue is still below the peaks it reached in 2022, yet the stock price has significantly climbed since that point. This is partially due to improving profit margins and share buybacks boosting earnings, but the price investors must pay for Apple's stock has also climbed.\nWhile investors used to be able to purchase the stock for somewhere in the mid-to high-20s times forward earnings, that's no longer the case. At more than 32 times forward earnings, Apple stocks trade for a substantial premium over the broader market's 23.7 times forward earnings (measured by the S&P 500).\nWhen a stock has that much premium over the broader market, it needs to grow earnings rapidly, which requires strong revenue growth.\nWhile Apple Intelligence and the iPhone 16 were supposed to supply that to Apple, preliminary signs are pointing toward that not working out. Once investors get more official data, this could ignite a larger sell-off in the stock. Until then, Apple is still a very expensive stock that is trading on the promise of future success. There are other stocks out there that are far cheaper and have a clearer path to success than Apple, and investors should consider moving capital into them instead of Apple.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Online retailers in China have slashed the prices of Apple's new iPhone 16 series ahead of its official release, as consumers in the world's largest smartphone market hold out for the release of the US company's first on-device artificial intelligence (AI) software.\nPDD Holdings' Pinduoduo, one of the country's most popular e-commerce platforms, has started selling the iPhone 16 Plus with 512 gigabytes of storage for 8,999 yuan (US$1,268), a 10 per cent discount from the official price of 9,999 yuan. The 128GB iPhone 16 is being sold at an even steeper 11 per cent discount.\nBoth Pinduoduo and Alibaba Group Holding's' Taobao marketplace have slapped a 4 per cent discount on the 256GB version of the high-end iPhone 16 Pro Max, lowering the price by 400 yuan to 9,599 yuan. Alibaba's Tmall shopping platform also offers buyers the option to pay for a new Apple handset in 24 instalments without interest charges.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

The iPhone 16 ships this Friday without AI features, considered the main selling point of the new series.\nWhile Apple said it will launch its AI system in US English next month and in localised English in several markets in December, other languages, including Chinese, will not be available until next year. The company has also given no indication of how it plans to offer Apple Intelligence in China, where the government has tight oversight over generative AI services accessible by the public.\nInitial response to the new iPhone on Chinese social media appeared to be tepid.\nAcross the globe, pre-order sales in the first weekend for the iPhone 16 series were down nearly 13 per cent from last year's iPhone 15 series, partly because Apple Intelligence is missing at launch, according to Kuo Ming-chi, analyst at TF International Securities.\n\"Additionally, intense competition in the Chinese market continues to impact iPhone demand,\" he said.\nThe Mate XT smartphone on display at a Huawei store in Shanghai.

Huawei made a surprise comeback to the 5G smartphone market last year with a device equipped with an advanced, locally-made processor, in defiance of US sanctions.\nApple risks losing further market share to Huawei and other domestic brands in the premium segment in China, consultancy Counterpoint Research said last month.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company recently fell out of the top five ranking of smartphone vendors in China by quarterly shipments, the first time that domestic vendors dominated all the top five positions, according to research firm Canalys.\nBut Apple so far appears unfazed by the competition from Huawei.\nThe US tech giant has lowered the trade-in value, or the amount of money a consumer receives for trading in their older device for a new one, by up to 16 per cent in China, according to a Jefferies research note last week.\n\"Apple may now conclude Huawei's tech capabilities are constrained by advanced chip access, and for those who wanted to switch from iPhone to Huawei have already done so,\" Jefferies analysts wrote.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has a history of producing the world's most valuable companies. United States Steel became the first-ever $1 billion company in 1901, and 117 years later, Apple became the first company in the world to surpass a $1 trillion valuation.\nApple is now worth over $3 trillion, but since 2018, tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet have joined it in the trillion-dollar club. But I think yet another is on track to join them.\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL) was founded in 1977 and has since participated in nearly every technological revolution. Right now, it's quickly becoming a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) data center infrastructure, which could be the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation.\nBased on Oracle's current market cap of $429 billion, investors who buy its stock today could earn a gain of 133% if it gets there.\nLarge language models (LLMs)\u00a0are at the foundation of every AI software application. They are trained by ingesting mountains of data, and from there, the model identifies patterns and learns to make predictions. Typically, the \"smartest\" AI applications are powered by the LLMs with the most data, and the training process is facilitated by centralized data centers filled with graphics processing units (GPUs).\nNvidia supplies the world's most powerful GPUs for developing AI models. Simply put, the more GPUs a developer can access, the more data they can feed into an LLM, and the faster it can be processed. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Supercluster technology allows developers to scale up to more than 32,000 Nvidia GPUs (and soon, over 65,000), which is more than any other data center provider.\nPlus, the company's random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology moves data from one point to another more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since developers often pay for computing capacity by the minute, OCI is among the fastest and cheapest solutions for training LLMs. That's why AI leaders like OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk's xAI are now using Oracle.\nOracle chairman Larry Ellison says the company currently has 85 live data centers, with 77 under construction. However, he estimates the company will eventually have somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000, so it has barely scratched the surface of its opportunity so far.\nAutomation is one thing that sets Oracle apart from other data center operators. No matter its size, every Oracle data center is identical in terms of functionality, so the company is able to manage them all with software alone -- no humans required. Not only is that a big cost savings for the end-user, but it also creates a more secure service by eliminating human error. Plus, automation is the key to scaling up Oracle's data center locations into the thousands.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), a 7% increase from the year-ago period. The OCI segment, specifically, delivered $2.2 billion in revenue, up by a whopping 46%.\nAs in previous quarters, OCI revenue would have grown even faster during Q1 if the company had more data centers online. It currently has an enormous backlog of customers waiting for more computing capacity.\nThat is reflected in Oracle's remaining performance obligations, which came in at a record $99 billion during the quarter, up 52% year over year. That was an acceleration from the 44% growth the company achieved in the final quarter of fiscal 2024. Oracle signed 42 new deals for GPU capacity worth $3 billion during Q1 alone, contributing to the sharp increase in remaining performance obligations (RPOs).\nCEO Safra Catz believes 38% of the company's RPOs (around $37.6 billion) will be converted to revenue over the next 12 months, which should help the company return to double-digit percentage growth at the top line. Additionally, she expects an acceleration in OCI growth compared to the previous fiscal year.\nOracle has generated $3.88 in trailing-12-month earnings per share. So, based on its current stock price of $155.89, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40.2. The Nasdaq-100 technology index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.7, so Oracle stock certainly isn't cheap when measured against its peers.\nHowever, Oracle's trailing-12-month earnings grew by 15% compared to the prior period, and Wall Street is forecasting accelerated earnings growth of 24% for fiscal 2025 overall. That might explain why investors are now willing to pay a premium for its stock.\nMathematically speaking, if Oracle's P/E ratio remains constant, the company could achieve a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years, even if its earnings growth slows to just 8.8%. But that's a very conservative estimate considering based on Ellison's comments, it could grow its data center footprint tenfold over the long term. If that happens, Oracle's earnings growth is likely to accelerate, not decelerate, in the coming decade.\nRemember, the company's data centers rely on automation, so they offer incredible scalability. In other words, Oracle should experience an expanding gross profit margin as more data centers are built, which will be a huge tailwind for its earnings.\nAs a result, I think Oracle has a great opportunity to join its big-tech peers in the $1 trillion club within the next decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Calls: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell Now.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0 ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC yet again talked about the importance of investing in individual stocks and said with discipline and patience beginner investors can beat the market by picking solid stocks with strong fundamentals.\n\u201cIf you are willing to put in the work, regular people can trounce the averages as long as you are disciplined and you follow the rules,\u201d Cramer said.\nTalking about his stock-picking process, Cramer said that he likes to \u201cstart\u201d hunting for stocks by going through the list of stocks making new highs. This is a good start, according to Cramer, because a lot of times momentum keeps pushing the same stocks higher and higher unless something fundamentally changes. Cramer said he does not recommend buying stocks when they are trading at new highs. Instead, he waits for a pullback.\n\u201cNew high list is not a shopping list it\u2019s an inspirational list. You keep an eye on those names and then wait for them to come down before you pull the trigger,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer said that you should only pile into stocks on a pullback if you believe they will rebound for reasons \u201cunrelated to the broader market.\u201d\nFor this article, we picked 10 key stocks Jim Cramer is talking about during his programs these days. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer recently talked to T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert and came out very hopeful on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone sales. Talking about the over sentiment after his interview, Cramer said:\n\u201cDo you think he doesn\u2019t know more about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and sales than these three stooges who said Apple has already time to go, sell it?\u201d Cramer said.\nSievert told Cramer that the \u201cfirst week was better than last year.\u201d\nCramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of his top picks \u201cdespite endless sources trying to shake you out of this.\u201d\nShipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n\u201cWait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,\u201d said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. \u201cOn average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.\u201d\nIn the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they\u2019re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\nHowever, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Calls: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell Now. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "CUPERTINO, Calif., October 01, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In celebration of World Teachers\u2019 Day, Apple\u00ae today launched all-new free classroom resources to help educators and students embrace creativity in any lesson, and is celebrating educators through special collections and offerings across Apple services. Additionally, the company announced a major expansion of its groundbreaking education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, reaching students and teachers across six continents with free grant-funded STEAM programming.\nOver the past four decades, Apple has been a committed educational leader. Through its work in education, the company has shared its cutting-edge technology and professional learning resources with millions of students and educators, equipping them with the tools to create new worlds, connect in engaging ways, and pursue the jobs of tomorrow. To illustrate the reach of its efforts, Apple is also releasing its first-ever Education Impact Report, which provides a snapshot of the work the company is doing to support teachers and learners worldwide.\n\"At Apple, we have always believed in the power of education to open new doors and give people the tools they need to build a better, more equitable world,\" said Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. \"We\u2019re blown away to see how tomorrow\u2019s coders, creators, innovators, and leaders are using Apple technology and resources to make their impact known today \u2014 and we\u2019re thrilled to expand our education work into even more communities.\"\n\"We\u2019re inspired by the incredible work coming out of classrooms and communities across the globe, and the myriad of ways Apple products like Mac and iPad empower learners to create and build on their passions,\" said Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of Education and Enterprise Marketing. \"Our new Creative Activities for early learners and students make learning easy and fun, and most importantly, give educators quick tools to engage learners of all ages.\"\nSupporting Teachers and Community Educators with New Tools\nOver the course of Apple\u2019s long history in education, professional learning and educator resources have always been key parts of the company\u2019s approach, as the effective use of technology can help unlock the potential of all learners.\nToday, Apple is launching new Everyone Can Create\u00ae resources for teachers. Creative Activities are a collection of quick, interactive, and fun lesson ideas that empower educators to sprinkle imagination and originality into their learning plans. Creative Activities for Early Learners (ages 4 to 8) and Creative Activities for Students (ages 8 and up) enable teachers to engage their students without increasing their workload. Each activity strengthens essential skills and gets students creating quickly with templates and shareable links.\nNew Creative Activities include:\nDrawing: Reveal a Constellation\nPhoto: Create a Sticker Collage\nVideo: See More in Slo-Mo\nMusic: Lay Down a Beat\nThe new Creative Activities are now available in the Apple Education Community, a professional learning hub with more than 1 million members where educators can find inspiration, share resources, and connect with peers. This week, the Apple Education Community is expanding its Forum collaboration features to 16 additional countries and regions, enabling participation from even more educators around the world.1\nIn addition, Apple continues to expand Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that helps educators coach teachers on how to get the most out of Apple products. With new lessons and the ability to register and participate at any time, Apple Learning Coach is now available in eight languages across 15 countries and regions.2 To date, more than 4,000 certified Apple Learning Coaches have guided nearly 100,000 teachers, impacting 2.4 million students.\nReaching Students and Teachers on Six Continents Through Grant Programs\nApple works with schools and nonprofit organizations around the world to provide grants and other hands-on programming designed to expand access to technology, along with educational and workforce opportunities. To date, the company has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in technology, tools, and resources to more than 200 education and community partners. In the last year alone, Apple has expanded its support to nearly 40 new education partners across Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nThis work is largely connected to Apple\u2019s Community Education Initiative, through which the company provides hardware, scholarships, financial support, educator resources, and access to Apple experts to schools and organizations in under-resourced communities. Apple collaborates with each partner organization to customize and enhance programming to support the community\u2019s specific goals and transform students\u2019 in-school and extracurricular experiences.\nApple\u2019s extensive education initiatives also include Apple Developer Academies and the Apple Foundation Program, which bring coding education and skills training to developers and entrepreneurs around the world, along with free resources like Everyone Can Code\u00ae, Develop in Swift Tutorials, Everyone Can Create, Challenge for Change, and Today at Apple\u00ae sessions at all Apple Store\u00ae locations.\nAs detailed in the newly released Education Impact Report, in the past five years, more than 10,000 teachers have received professional learning opportunities through Apple grants. Over that same time frame, 500,000 students in close to 2,000 schools and communities around the world have engaged in the company\u2019s grant programs. Apple currently supports more than 200 schools and nonprofit organizations \u2014 a number that continues to increase.\nForging New Partnerships and Deepening Existing Work\nCodeDoor, one of Apple\u2019s newer partners, provides coding and workforce preparedness training for migrants throughout Germany. Apple supports the organization\u2019s Creators program, which uses Everyone Can Code resources and Swift Playgrounds\u00ae to give participants the tools to design and pitch apps as solutions to community challenges. Through a hybrid experience that takes place over the course of eight months, participants acquire valuable skills, including coding with Swift\u00ae and presentation techniques.\n\"CodeDoor was created from the idea that young people are curious and approach learning as a process of discovery, but need the right tools to feel empowered,\" said Karan Dehghani, CodeDoor\u2019s founder. \"With support from Apple, our Creators program teaches learners from migrant families how to identify and solve real-life problems through app development \u2014 equipping a new generation of Germans with the skills they need to build community and a brighter future.\"\nApple is also deepening its work with existing community partners. Since 2020, the company has collaborated with the New York Public Library to expand access to technology through in-person and virtual training classes for learners of all ages and skill levels, with a focus on helping adults develop confidence in their computer skills and grow more comfortable in today\u2019s digital world.\n\"The world is evolving so fast.

        "Text": "Consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has had a pretty good year, with its stock up roughly 19% as of Sept. 11, outperforming the broader market. However, like most tech stocks, September has thus far not been friendly to Apple, which has seen its stock fall approximately 3.5% this month.\nRecently, Apple debuted its new iPhone 16 during an event held at its headquarters, and the phone will feature a new artificial intelligence (AI) software called Apple Intelligence. The news has prompted one prominent Wall Street tech analyst to boost his already bullish outlook on the stock. Let's take a look.\nPrior to his recent note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives already had an outperform rating on Apple and a $285 price target. Now, Ives is reiterating his bullish outlook and boosting his price target to $300, suggesting 36% upside from Apple's current stock price of $221, as of Sept. 11.\nIves is excited about the new iPhone rollout and thinks it could be the company's most successful iPhone release in company history, as well as a \"launching pad for the consumer AI revolution globally.\" In addition, Ives believes a new phase of customer interaction and personalization with their phones is now underway with Apple Intelligence, which will ultimately spark a \"renaissance of iPhone growth\" and push Apple to a $4 trillion market cap.\nApple is not necessarily a cheap stock at 33x earnings, but it has traded more expensively in recent years and served investors very well. While predicting how impactful AI will ultimately be to consumers is always a bit of a fickle task, Apple has a strong track record of leading the way on consumer tech innovation, so Ives' excitement is certainly worthy of investors' attention.\nOver the last three quarters, more than half the total sales came from the iPhone, so obviously the product is one of, if not the most important for the company. If the iPhone 16 is as good as Ives thinks, it could certainly boost sales and the stock significantly.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When it comes to tech, there are so many different brands that it\u2019s sometimes hard to find one you can trust. Not only that, but you don\u2019t want to end up spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on products that simply aren\u2019t worth the value.\nCheck Out: 7 Best New Nordstrom Rack Clothing Items That Are Worth Every Penny\nFor You: 9 Ways To Spend Less and Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nFor financial experts Diego Apaza and Melanie Musson, one standout tech company is Apple. These are their top reasons why they favor Apple products over the competition.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nWhen asked why she chooses Apple over other tech brands, Melanie Musson, a finance expert with InsuranceProviders.com, had a very straight-to-the-point answer. \u201cApple innovates; the competition copies,\u201d she said.\nSince its inception in the 1970s, Apple has emphasized innovation. This is something the company has shown time and time again in the way it continually innovates upon its existing product line. Whether you\u2019re purchasing a MacBook Air, iPad Pro, AirPods, or any number of accessories, their tech is top of the line.\nYou can see this in everything from the user-friendly interfaces to the novel features they put out. And the company doesn\u2019t stop once it\u2019s produced something groundbreaking or remodeled some existing tech. It keeps going year after year, offering up the latest and greatest gadgets of the modern time.\nRead Next: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than Apple\nIt seems like there\u2019s a new tech upgrade at least once a year, if not more frequently. But while Apple does reinvent and update its existing gadgets regularly, even the older devices tend to be worth a good deal. This is due to a combination of durability and functionality, though the aesthetic definitely plays a role for many Apple users.\nStill, considering how quickly tech changes and how limited older devices can feel, the fact that Apple products often retain their value is rather impressive.\n\u201cThe best tech for the money, in my opinion, is Apple. It might sound like a basic answer, but Apple has consistently shown strong resale value and maintains high consumer interest,\u201d said Diego Apaza, CEO at Alpha Stocks Lab.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a tech world without Apple in it, but this is more by design than happenstance. The company has built a reputation for itself that has kept consumers coming back for years. There\u2019s a reason why there are so many die-hard iPhone and MacBook fans who can\u2019t imagine switching to any other brand for their smartphones, computers, wearables, or other gadgets.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been a dominant player in the market for decades, and they still hold a commanding position compared to their competitors,\u201d said Apaza. \u201cThey\u2019ve managed to position themselves as a leader in the sector and have built an ecosystem that can sustain itself even if some popular products fall out of favor.\u201d\nApaza added that Apple products are a premium purchase. Not only that but, thanks to the company\u2019s solid reputation in the industry, they\u2019ve managed to keep themselves at the forefront of many people\u2019s minds for decades now.\nTech, especially new tech, is expensive. Apple doesn\u2019t exactly sell its products cheap, which can be a double-edged sword.\nOn the one hand, this leads to greater resale value and makes Apple a worthwhile investment. On the other hand, the company\u2019s products aren\u2019t the most affordable.\nStill, that doesn\u2019t stop people from buying.\n\u201cOf course, Apple products are often more expensive than those of other companies and brands, but they last longer. Also, the benefits are worth the extra cost,\u201d said Musson. \u201cA MacBook can last 10 years. A PC that is 10 years old is so beyond outdated that you\u2019d probably have a hard time even turning it on.\u201d\nSo many people want to streamline their lives \u2014 from their finances to their tech. And with Apple, they can actually do that.\n\u201cApple products work together in a way other tech companies wish their products did,\u201d said Musson. \u201cSo, if you have family members, friends, or a significant other with Apple products, you can easily share and collaborate.\u201d\nIf you invest in Apple products, you can build a seamless network of devices that work together in ways that optimize your experience. Some users call this the \u201cApple Ecosystem.\u201d It\u2019s a true unity of information and devices that\u2019s difficult to find elsewhere. For many, this integration is well worth the cost of the individual products.\nIn conclusion, everyone has their own idea of what company produces the best tech for the money, but Apple stands out for its continuous innovation, strong resale value, longevity, reliability and overall quality. For individuals who want to be able to seamlessly integrate their tech devices, as well as for those looking for a long-term investment for their lives, Apple has a lot to offer.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Moves For Building Lasting Wealth: What Smart Americans Are Doing Right\n3 Best Florida Cities To Buy Property in the Next 5 Years, According To Real Estate Agents\nThe Average Consumer Has $6,329 in Credit Card Debt.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News You Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The ability of generative AI to handle complex tasks like legal document drafting and even medical diagnoses has led experts to view it as a game-changer across industries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nBig Tech CEOs are hyper-focused on AI development right now. Satya Nadella has famously remarked that AI is the defining technology of our time, emphasizing the role of generative AI tools that his company markets, such as Copilot and Azure OpenAI, in revolutionizing work processes and enhancing productivity. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai has stressed the importance of setting up responsible AI development, remarking that the potential of AI is immense, and noting that it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. Andy Jassy has claimed that with cloud cost optimization programs largely in the rearview, companies are now turning their attention to investments in generative AI that is already a multi-billion-dollar business.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a010 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI news that has not received significant media coverage but is important to the AI market nonetheless.

Latest reports suggest that the company has given more people a chance to test a new AI software update that is going to automate features through the virtual assistant Siri. The new update was made available earlier this week and will soon be released to all iPhone owners. The new iPhones, touted as AI-capable, are powered by new chips and software, which Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) claims sets them apart from competitor products in the smartphone space. The AI software features are being dubbed Apple Intelligence and concerns have been raised over the soft demands for these phones given the slow rollout of the new AI software.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI news you probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, during an interview with CNBC last month, called the decline in Mag. 7 stocks after Q2 earnings representative of a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in the industry.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s popular to talk about AI because these stocks are driving the market, but at a certain point, you want to get a return on all of this money you are investing.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cInvestors were reminded of the strength of the\u00a0Apple Inc.

Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc.

        "Text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free,\u00a0here.\nApple is wedging AI into its phones like a new U2 album no one asked for.\nWhether you\u2019re an Apple fangirl who has already reserved the $1,200 iPhone 16 Pro Max or a normie trapped in too many yearslong blue-bubble-only group chats, at some point soon you\u2019ll end up with artificial intelligence features built right into your phone.\nIt hardly matters that the real-world applications for most AI products are, so far, both underwhelming and unreliable. In the absence of any other major innovations, Apple is betting even nascent AI tools will inspire folks to upgrade and usher in a \u201csuper cycle\u201d of sales for the next year.\nHowever, given the \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d highlights the company previewed in June and officially rolled out Monday, investors and customers alike may want to temper their expectations. Even Apple seemed to hedge a bit: It never mentioned the words \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d\nThe new tools look \u2026 fine. Cute, even. They are exactly what we\u2019ve come to expect from Apple \u2014 intuitive, friendly, mostly not creepy. With iPhone 16, you\u2019ll get a smarter, more human-sounding Siri. You\u2019ll be able to generate bespoke emojis by typing something like \u201cheart eyes zombie eating pizza.\u201d You can point your camera at a dog in the park and the phone can tell you (approximately) what breed it is.\nBut the AI tools on offer right now are firmly in the \u201cnice to have\u201d category \u2014 not the \u201cmust-have\u201d that would spur someone to drop a grand on a new device.\n\u201cDespite the unknowns of feature timing and global rollout, I believe consumers will get excited about these AI features,\u201d tweeted Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, ahead of the phone\u2019s formal unveiling at Apple HQ. Munster expects iPhone sales will exceed Wall Street\u2019s estimates in the coming quarters.\nOf course, the way iPhone cycles go, even a ho-hum iPhone 16 should do decent sales, given that many customers have been holding onto older phones and are due for an upgrade anyway. That\u2019s still a positive \u2014 brand loyalty is one of Apple\u2019s biggest strengths, which is partly why Apple is taking its time to integrate AI slowly and transparently (having learned its lesson from the 2014 U2 album debacle).\nFor an event built around unveiling Apple\u2019s first AI-powered iPhone, there was one striking absence over the two-hour presentation: the words \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d\nInstead, CEO Tim Cook and other company spokespeople referred only to their \u201cintelligent\u201d features.\nTo be clear: \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d is Apple\u2019s proprietary AI. But Apple \u2014 the most brand-conscious company on the planet \u2014 understands something that often gets lost in the bot-pilled bubble of Silicon Valley: Regular people don\u2019t trust AI.\nWhile developers in Silicon Valley and investors on Wall Street have gone all-in on a future powered by bots, the people who are meant to be buying these AI-powered devices need a little more convincing. (And even Wall Street enthusiasts are increasingly losing patience with the technology\u2019s lack of ROI.)\nOver the summer, a study published in the Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management found that describing a product as \u201cAI-powered\u201d tends to lower a customer\u2019s intention to buy it.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why: Our interactions with chatbots and AI image generators have quickly taught us to be skeptical of their stilted, often flatly incorrect renderings. When something looks inauthentic, we now say it looks like it was generated by a bot. When we hear a politician fumble their stump speech, we quip that it sounds like ChatGPT wrote it.\nThe always image-conscious Apple knows better than to fall into the \u201cAI\u201d trap, even if its whole pitch for the new iPhone is AI.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Is Selling Apple Stock and Buying This Little-Known Stock Instead",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest companies in the world through intelligent acquisitions and prudent investments.\nAfter famously eschewing technology stocks for years, Berkshire surprised Wall Street in 2016 when it reported a stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Even more surprising were the subsequent share purchases that eventually made Apple its largest holding.\nLast year, Buffett referred to Apple as being a \"better business\" than any other Berkshire owned, but great businesses are not necessarily smart investments. Berkshire sold 389 million shares of Apple in the second quarter, cutting its stake in half, and the company started a small position in the lesser-known Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA).\nTo be clear, Berkshire still has 30% of its stock portfolio invested in Apple, but that represents a substantial reduction from 51% in the same quarter last year. Also noteworthy, Berkshire has allocated less than 1% of its portfolio to Ulta, but its novelty sets it apart from long-standing positions.\nHere's what investors should know about these stocks.\nApple reported solid financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended June 29). The company not only beat overall sales and earnings estimates, but also its sales exceeded expectations across every major product category except Macs. Revenue increased 5% to $85.8 billion, gross profit margin expanded 174 basis points, and GAAP net income increased 11% to $1.40 per diluted share.\nLooking ahead, Apple is well positioned to maintain similar momentum. The company has a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including personal computers and smartphones. It also has a strong presence in several service verticals. Apple has one of the fastest-growing advertising businesses and it operates the leading mobile app store. Last year, the App Store earned more than twice as much revenue as Alphabet's Google Play Store.\nHowever, Apple is also facing several headwinds. First, the Digital Markets Act in Europe forced the company to support third-party app stores on its devices, which could erode its dominance in the space. Second, Apple has lost so much smartphone share in China (its third largest market) that it no longer ranks among the top five vendors. Third, iPhones account for 45% of total revenue, but the company has yet to eclipse the iPhone sales record set in the first quarter of 2022.\nBuilding on that, Apple possesses tremendous brand authority in consumer electronics, but the company has not launched a new viral product since AirPods in 2017. If that continues, Apple will struggle to exceed mid-single digit sales growth. Earnings may grow faster because the company has historically spent heavily on stock buybacks. But earnings growth that is largely dependent on share repurchases is a sign of a company with limited prospects.\nNothing I've mentioned so far is a deal-breaker, per se. The real problem lies in the disconnect between Apple's growth prospects and its current valuation. Wall Street expects earnings to grow at 8.6% annually over the next three years, which makes its valuation of 33.5 times earnings look outrageous. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 3.9, a substantial premium to three-year average of 2.6. The sky-high valuation may explain why Warren Buffett slashed his stake in Apple.\nUlta operates more than 1,400 stores across the United States, where it sells about 25,000 products spanning mass-market to high-end items from approximately 600 brands. Over the last few years, Ulta has secured a leadership position among U.S. beauty retailers due to store openings, effective marketing, compelling loyalty perks, and investments in e-commerce.\nUlta reported disappointing financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased less than 1% to $2.6 billion, and same-store sales actually declined 1%. Meanwhile, gross margin contracted 100 basis points, and GAAP earnings declined 11% to $5.30 per diluted share. Management also lowered its full-year outlook, such that evenue and earnings are forecasted to decline 1% and 11%, respectively.\nIn a recent note, Morningstar analyst David Swartz attributed Ulta's disappointing performance and guidance to competitive pressure, primarily arising from the rapid expansion of Sephora stores within Kohl's locations. But he thinks the company will turn things around. \"We forecast Ulta will expand its store base by about 20% over the next 10 years while achieving same-store sales growth of about 4%,\" he wrote.\nUlta is undoubtedly facing headwinds, but the stock is priced more reasonably than Apple. Wall Street expects earnings to increase at 9% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 15 times earnings seem fair. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.6, which is a slight premium to the three-year average of 1.5.\nI think patient investors can follow Berkshire's lead and buy a small position in Ulta stock today. But small is the key word. I would start with no more than 1% of my portfolio and build my position opportunistically during pullbacks. But investors should bear in mind that Ulta has failed to outperform the S&P 500 over the last three- and five-year periods.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic According to Financial Media.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nOne of the primary growth drivers in the AI industry over the past few years has been the exponential increase in data generation. The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, e-commerce, and various digital platforms has led to an unprecedented surge in data production. This vast amount of data serves as the fuel for AI systems, particularly in the development of machine learning models. Clive Humby, a venture capitalist, emphasized the critical role of data in AI development by famously proclaiming that data is the new oil. The ability to collect, process, and analyze large datasets allows AI algorithms to improve accuracy and deliver more sophisticated outputs.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nTo understand the AI revolution, it is also important to understand advancements in computing power. Moore\u2019s Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a microchip approximately every two years, has played a crucial role in enhancing the processing power available for AI applications - consider companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and their advanced node processing. The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) - like the ones made popular by NVIDIA - has further accelerated AI development by enabling faster computation and more complex model training. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds globally, says that these improvements in hardware have been a game-changer for AI.\nThe availability of massive investments in AI research and startups is also a key growth driver. According to a report by PwC, global investments in AI are expected to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030, with the technology contributing $6.6 trillion to GDP from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from consumption effects. This influx of capital is spurring innovation and the commercialization of AI technologies across various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Prominent hedge fund managers are also taking note. Ken Griffin, the chief of Citadel Investment Group, says that AI is the most transformative technology of our time, and not just another bubble, but a structural shift in the economy.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have explosive growth potential according to financial news outlets. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company is expected to debut new AI features that will be integrated into the smart devices that it markets, including the iPhone, at an event next month. Wall Street analysts are excited about the integration of new features since they are expected to drive sales of new Apple devices, primarily because the older models will not be able to support the new features. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring, in an investor note, highlighted that Apple Intelligence remained the key to unlocking pent-up iPhone demand and accelerating replacement cycle. The analyst further forecast that the Apple event in September would heavily feature AI integration on the new iPhone 16, though iPhone pricing and iPhone battery life would also be key details to watch.\nAt a tech event earlier this year, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed some of the capabilities of the new AI offering, which included massive changes to popular iPhone applications like Siri, Genmoji, and Image Playground. There are rumors that the firm may put advanced features of the AI software behind some kind of a paywall.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks that could go parabolic according to financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

The feature hasn't been FDA-cleared, however, although the company says that it expects approval \"soon.\" The new AirPods were announced at the Apple \"It's Glowtime\" event.\nThe hearing aid feature, when enabled, boosts specific sounds in real time, like parts of speech or elements of an environment. It also applies a personalized hearing profile (more on that below) to music, movies and phone calls across devices.\nApple says this will allow wearers to better hear their surroundings and engage in conversations.\nIn a related announcement, Apple previewed a five-minute certified hearing test coming to iOS 18 and AirPods Pro 2 that'll allow users to check their current hearing health. The test, which has users tap on their smartphone's screen after they hear a series of tones at different volumes and frequencies, builds on learnings from Apple's hearing studies, and was developed using \"large-scale real-world data,\" Apple says.\nAfter taking a hearing test, you'll get results in a personalized hearing profile (which the aforementioned hearing aid feature uses). The results will be stored in Apple's Health app, where they can optionally be shared with a healthcare provider.\nThe hearing profile can be applied in tandem with a feature called Media Assist to boost certain parts of speech on a phone call or instruments within a soundtrack. Apple claims that users with little-to-no hearing loss can still benefit from the adjustments at individual frequencies.\nBoth the hearing aid feature for AirPods Pro 2 and the hearing test for iOS 18 will launch this fall via a software update in over 100 countries and regions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOuNLS1elWsThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/09/apple-says-airpods-pro-2-can-be-used-as-clinical-grade-hearing-aids/\n"

        "Title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 184\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $93.8 million\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology firm in the world. It is a global brand and generates 52% of its revenue through the iPhone. This allows Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a sizeable user base of 1.5 billion users as of 2023, which is its gold mine in the simplest of terms. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s closed ecosystem means that its users have to use the firm's services, and it has used it to create a Services business that generates $78 billion in revenue annually. The user base is also the key to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis, as the confidence in its ability to ensure that the users continue to upgrade their iPhones. It has also allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to emerge as a late winner in the AI race. Its shares have lost a mere 1.71% since July, which pales in comparison to MSFT's 11.20% losses. This is because as opposed to MSFT, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is perceived to be in a better position to monetize AI due to its consumer focused business as opposed to the former's enterprise focused model.\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\u201cRecent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Ani Freedman ",
        "Text": "During the much-anticipated \u201cGlowtime\u201d event, Apple unveiled its new products, including the latest iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. But what the tech giant demonstrated was a renewed focus on health, boasting two \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d features on the new Apple Watch and AirPods Pro 2: sleep apnea detection and hearing aid features.\n\u201cThese new features expand across products, bringing informative and powerful ways to support users in their sleep and hearing health for conditions that impact billions globally,\u201d according to\u00a0Apple\u2019s press release.\nIf you\u2019re intrigued by whether Apple\u2019s new tech can help you optimize your health, here\u2019s what you need to know about how the new features will work.\nSleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start, according to the Mayo Clinic. It can cause you to snore loudly, not feel well-rested even after a full night of sleep, and may lead to serious health problems such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues.\nApple hopes to help users of its newest Apple Watches (Series 10, Series 9, and Ultra 2) recognize if they may have sleep apnea through a feature called Breathing Disturbances.\nIt works by using the accelerometer in the watch, which detects small movements at the wrist that could be signs of interruptions to normal respiratory patterns during sleep, Apple explains in the press release. Every 30 days, users can check the Health app to see breathing disturbance data, which notify you with consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea. After that, you can decide whether or not to talk to your doctor about next steps to address it.\nThe breathing disturbances feature can double as a metric of how restful your sleep is, Apple says. Sleep quality can be impacted by things like napping too late or too long, alcohol or caffeine consumption, or racing thoughts. The Health app will show nightly breathing disturbances picked up by the Apple Watch, which can reveal trends over time.\nYou can export a PDF of your breathing disturbances data to show your doctor, especially if you\u2019re concerned about sleep apnea.\nApple says the sleep apnea notification algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning technology paired with an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. Apple then validated the feature in a clinical study, in which every participant identified by the algorithm was found to have at least mild sleep apnea.\n\u201cThis is a major step forward in improving public health,\u201d Dr. Sairam Parthasarathy of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center for Sleep, Circadian, and Neurosciences\u2019s professor and director in Tucson, Arizona, said in the release..\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration just gave clearance to Apple\u2019s sleep apnea detection devices\u2014a step toward approval.\nHearing loss is frustrating for anyone, especially when you\u2019re trying to use hearing aids that can be counterintuitive or uncomfortable. With the new generation of AirPods Pro, users can employ a hearing aid capability supposed to be on par with over-the-counter hearing aids, Apple writes, best for people with mild to moderate hearing loss.\nAfter taking Apple\u2019s five-minute hearing test at home with the AirPods\u2014found in the Health app\u2014the headphones\u2019 technology can transform \u201cAirPods Pro into a clinical-grade hearing aid,\u201d according to the press release It takes into account your personal hearing test results, enabling \u201cpersonalized dynamic adjustments\u201d based on your hearing needs in the environment you\u2019re in to boost audio in real time.\nThe hearing aid feature can also be set up with an audiogram from a professional.\nApple says people with little to no hearing loss can benefit from the hearing test as well, as the test profile will enable specific audio adjustments at individual frequencies.\n\u201cHearing health is a cornerstone of overall wellbeing. Protecting and preserving our hearing enhances our quality of life both in the short-term and long-term,\u201d said Rick Neitzel, professor at University of Michigan School of Public Health and principal investigator of the Apple Hearing Study.\nFor more on health tech:\nTop CEOs are obsessed with this $300 Oura Ring that tracks sleep and health metrics\nContinuous glucose monitors are trendy wearables\u2014but how useful are they?

        "Title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors have lots of choices when picking what stocks to buy. Even among some of the most valuable companies out there, worthwhile opportunities might be available.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), for example, have produced monster returns during the past couple of decades. But which of these behemoth \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks is the better buy right now?\nThanks to its lineup of popular products, Apple has become one of the world's most recognizable brands. This brand moat has supported the company's impressive financial success over the years. According to Interbrand, Apple's brand is estimated to be worth $503 billion, more than any other business on Earth.\nWhat makes Apple special is that it has created a business model that successfully combines its hardware and software offerings. This so-called ecosystem gives the business a durable competitive advantage. The result is strong customer loyalty. Once consumers get familiar with using Apple's offerings, they are less likely to leave.\nConsequently, this means the company has historically benefited from pricing power. Its smartphones, tablets, and laptops carry premium price tags. But they are met with robust demand when each new iteration is released.\nApple is also incredibly profitable, which is another reason to appreciate the company. In the past five years, the business has posted an average gross margin of 42% and an average operating margin of 29%. This leads to lots of free cash flow -- to the tune of $100 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2023.\nManagement hasn't been shy about returning this capital to shareholders. During the past nine months, the business paid $11 billion in dividends and repurchased $70 billion of its stock. This favorable capital-return program is a staple of the Apple investment thesis.\nOne undeniable reason to buy Amazon shares is because the business benefits from multiple secular tailwinds. It's the dominant leader in e-commerce, as 38% of all online spending in the U.S. goes through Amazon.com. Plus, Amazon has its hands in cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS), streaming with Prime Video, and digital advertising. These trends should continue to propel the business in the years ahead.\nHistorically, investors have criticized Amazon for not prioritizing profitability. But management has been making major improvements, slashing costs, and focusing on driving greater efficiencies. In the second quarter, Amazon reported operating income of $14.7 billion. That figure was up an impressive 91% versus the same period a year ago.\nI mentioned Amazon Web Services before. This is a key growth and profit engine that gets a lot of attention. Revenue was up 19% in the last quarter, with an operating margin of more than 35%.\nAWS also positions the company to be a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. AWS looks to be an important infrastructure-service provider for businesses that want to develop their own AI capabilities, with offerings like data computing and storage, as well as machine learning.\nDespite the size of the business, analysts anticipate considerable growth. According to the average of Wall Street analyst estimates, Amazon is projected to increase revenue and earnings per share (EPS) at yearly rates of 10.7% and 36.4%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026.\nBoth Apple and Amazon are fantastic businesses, a statement most investors will not argue with. However, there's one important factor to consider before picking a winner.\nInvestors need to look at valuation as part of their decision-making process. As of this writing, Apple shares trade at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9.1. That represents a sizable 32% premium to its trailing-five-year average.\nOn the other hand, Amazon trades at a P/S of 3.4. This is in line with its five-year history. Therefore, I believe that Amazon is the better stock to buy right now. If we look out over the next three-to-five years, Amazon's return potential is higher than Apple's seems to be.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other ESG stocks.\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it\u2019s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn\u2019t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45\u00b0C\u2014closer than ever to the 1.5\u00b0C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists\u2019 initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\u201cIf you solely look at climate as your window, you\u2019ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.\u201d\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market\u2019s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as \u201cwoke\u201d investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren\u2019t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 7.32%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an obvious choice for ESG investors, given its strong commitment to labor rights, environmental responsibility, and ethical business practices across its supply chain. The tech giant has reduced its overall greenhouse gas emissions by over 55% since 2015, marking significant progress toward its ambitious Apple 2030 goal of achieving carbon neutrality across its entire value chain by the decade\u2019s end.\nOn the business front, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to demonstrate robust financial performance and growth potential, solidifying its leading position in the technology market. For fiscal Q3, the company reported revenue of $85.8 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year, surpassing analyst expectations of $84.5 billion. Earnings per share also rose by 11% to $1.40, exceeding the anticipated $1.35.\nOn August 2, Goldman Sachs raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $265 to $275 while maintaining a Buy rating. The firm highlighted Apple\u2019s strong performance in the iPhone segment and sustained momentum in its services business. Goldman Sachs anticipates a significant multi-year iPhone replacement cycle, bolstering its confidence in Apple\u2019s future growth.\nOn the other hand, MoffettNathanson initiated coverage of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Neutral rating and a $211 price target. Although the firm acknowledged Apple\u2019s strong AI strategy, the analysts also noted that the market has already priced in these developments. MoffettNathanson emphasized that while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-positioned to lead in AI, its advantage lies in the trust of over one billion users, particularly concerning personal data like contacts and emails, which Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) keeps securely under its control.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nThe latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values.

AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power.

Working across hardware and software to deliver the most natural listening experience, AirPods 4 with ANC also introduce intelligent features like Transparency mode to keep users aware of their environment; Adaptive Audio, which dynamically blends Transparency mode and ANC based on the conditions of a user\u2019s environment; and Conversation Awareness, which lowers the user\u2019s media volume when they start speaking to someone nearby.\nAirPods Max Get Five New Colors\nAirPods Max are available in five beautiful new colors, including midnight, starlight, blue, orange, and purple, and offer complementary finishes alongside other Apple products like Mac\u00ae and iPad\u00ae. Additionally, AirPods Max now feature USB-C charging capabilities, making them more convenient than ever to charge at home or on the go.\nAirPods Pro 2 Introduce the World\u2019s First All-in-One Hearing Health Experience\nApproximately 1.5 billion people around the world are living with hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization. Building on years of work in hearing health \u2014 including the Noise app on Apple Watch, headphone audio levels with iPhone\u00ae, hearing accessibility features, and the Apple Hearing Study \u2014 Apple is introducing an end-to-end experience focused on prevention, awareness, and assistance.\nPrevention\nAccording to the Apple Hearing Study, one in three people are regularly exposed to loud environmental noise levels that can impact their hearing. That can include common scenarios like taking the subway while commuting, mowing the lawn at home, attending a sporting event, and many more. In order to help users prevent exposure to loud environmental noise while preserving the sound signature of what they\u2019re listening to, Hearing Protection comes to AirPods Pro. The ear tips help to provide passive noise reduction, while the H2 chip helps to actively reduce louder, more intermittent noise at 48,000 times per second. On by default across all listening modes, Hearing Protection is helpful in a variety of loud settings. Plus, with an all-new multiband high dynamic range algorithm, sounds at live events like concerts remain natural and vibrant so users don\u2019t miss a beat.\nAwareness\nApple is also introducing a scientifically validated Hearing Test feature with AirPods Pro and a compatible iPhone or iPad, expanding the ability for users to quickly check their hearing from the comfort of their home in minutes. The test is simple to take, utilizes a standard clinical approach called pure-tone audiometry, leverages advanced acoustic science, and provides users with an interactive experience. When a user completes the test, they will see an easy-to-understand summary of their results in a personalized hearing profile for AirPods Pro, which is stored privately and securely in their Health app. Users can also share these results with their healthcare providers for more informed conversations.\nAssistance\n\"Hearing health is an essential part of our overall wellbeing, yet it can often be overlooked \u2014 in fact, according to the Apple Hearing Study, a staggering 75 percent of people diagnosed with hearing loss go untreated,\" said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple\u2019s vice president of Health. \"We\u2019re thrilled to provide breakthrough software features with AirPods Pro that put users\u2019 hearing health front and center, bringing new ways to help test for and receive assistance for hearing loss.\"\nAirPods Pro also add an innovative, over-the-counter Hearing Aid capability for users with mild to moderate hearing loss. Using the personalized hearing profile from the Hearing Test, this new feature seamlessly transforms AirPods Pro into a clinical-grade hearing aid. After setup, the feature enables personalized dynamic adjustments so users have the sounds around them boosted in real time. This helps users better engage in conversation and keeps them connected to the people and environment around them. With the incredible audio quality of AirPods Pro, the user\u2019s personalized hearing profile is automatically applied to music, movies, games, and phone calls across their devices without needing to adjust any settings. This first-of-its-kind software-based Hearing Aid feature brings users the ability to fine-tune their experience at any time, making access to hearing assistance easier than ever at an approachable price point. Users can also set up the Hearing Aid feature with an audiogram created by a hearing health professional. Both the Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are grounded in science and were validated through rigorous scientific studies. The Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are expected to receive marketing authorization from global health authorities soon, and will be available this fall in more than 100 countries and regions, including the United States, Germany, and Japan.\nAfter taking the Hearing Test, users can also use their hearing profile to personalize the AirPods Pro listening experience. This benefits even more people, including those with little to no hearing loss, who can take advantage of specific adjustments at individual frequencies. To help provide the best listening experience, Media Assist is an all-new feature that helps boost certain parts of speech on a phone call or instruments within a soundtrack to help an even broader population.\nBetter for the Environment\nAirPods are designed to minimize their impact on the environment. The new AirPods 4 design includes the use of 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. The case also uses 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board and 100 percent recycled aluminum in the hinge. AirPods 4 are free of potentially harmful substances such as mercury, BFRs, and PVC. In a first for AirPods, 100 percent of the packaging is made using fiber-based materials, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025. Additionally, Apple reduced the packaging volume by more than 30 percent compared to the previous generation, which helps decrease emissions from shipping and move closer to Apple\u2019s commitment of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nPricing and Availability\nCustomers can now pre-order AirPods 4 for $129 (U.S.) from apple.com/store and in the Apple Store\u00ae app in the U.S. and more than 58 other countries and regions, with availability beginning Friday, September 20.\nCustomers can now pre-order AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation for $179 (U.S.) from apple.com/store and in the Apple Store app in the U.S. and more than 58 other countries and regions, with availability beginning Friday, September 20.\nNew hearing health features will be available this fall for AirPods Pro 2 customers in a free software update when paired with iPhone or iPad running iOS 18 or iPadOS\u00ae 18.1\nAirPods Pro 2 are available for $249 (U.S.) from apple.com/store and in the Apple Store app today.\nCustomers can now pre-order AirPods Max with USB-C charging for $549 (U.S.) from apple.com/store and in the Apple Store app in the U.S. and more than 60 other countries and regions, with availability beginning Friday, September 20.\nNew subscribers can get Apple Music\u00ae free for three months with the purchase of any AirPods, AirPods Pro, or AirPods Max.

        "Author": "  Vardah Gill ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Innovative Stocks that Pay Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other best innovative stocks that pay dividends.\nInnovation plays a crucial role in today\u2019s market. With the significant attention tech stocks have gained over the past year, it\u2019s clear where investors are directing their funds. Tech firms are leveraging disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence to process vast, complex datasets. In the healthcare sector, advancements in research and development (R&D) have led to life-saving drug therapies and treatments. Meanwhile, the growing impact of climate change is pushing energy and utility companies to prioritize renewable energy sources. Therefore, innovation lies at the heart of every industry today.\nBusinesses in the US and globally swiftly recognized the influence of innovation on their growth and operations, and they are gradually shaping their activities around it. A recent McKinsey survey of over 1,000 executives revealed that companies with a strong culture of innovation are twice as successful as some of their peers in scaling digital transformations. These innovative firms focus on technologies and changes to their operating models that promote rapid learning and adaptation\u2014essential components of innovation. The report also highlighted that 14 of the top 20 global companies have leveraged innovation to either expand existing markets or create entirely new ones.\nRead also:\u00a0Top 18 Automotive Industry Innovations and Trends\nA key component of innovation is R&D, which focuses on systematic and scientific investigation to create new products, technologies, or processes. Through R&D investments, companies can strengthen their abilities, explore fresh ideas, and discover innovative solutions to address customer demands. Businesses worldwide, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector, have boosted their R&D investments to develop new products that meet the demands of their customers. Financial Times reported that R&D in the US has grown in recent decades, increasing from 2.2% of GDP in the 1980s to 3.4% in 2021. This rise is mainly due to the private sector\u2019s contribution, which doubled to 2.5% of GDP. Moreover, the percentage of the population involved in patent creation almost doubled during this time.\nIt\u2019s not just established companies that are embracing innovation in their operations; the rise of US startups also reflects this trend, as they introduce groundbreaking business ideas previously unheard of. Economist John Haltiwanger found that Americans were starting new businesses at an unprecedented rate. And he\u2019s not mistaken. In 2020, more new businesses were launched than in any previous year, with 2021 following closely behind. According to the Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship, the one-year survival rate for these startups exceeded 80% in 2021, marking the highest rate since 1999. Haltiwanger noted that a surge in new businesses is a strong indicator of job creation, innovation, and productivity growth within the economy. He further said that startup booms not only reflect technological innovation but also significantly drive it. Startups explore how to leverage new technologies, experiment with them, and create new products, pushing competitors to adapt and innovate in response. Research from Texas McCombs, which examined 6,116 patents from the mid-1970s to 2016, highlighted the impact of startups on innovation. The study found that patents from startups were cited 8.5% more each year and 21% more over a nine-year period compared to patents from established companies.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds as of Q2 2024 and picked companies that actively prioritize and promote the development of new and groundbreaking ideas, products, services, or business processes. From that list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment towards them. These companies belong to different sectors, including healthcare, technology, aerospace, and defense.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has played a key role in creating revolutionary devices and services that have transformed the consumer electronics market, including the iPhone, iPad, iTunes, and the App Store, among others. The stock has surged by nearly 19% since the start of 2024 and in the past 12 months, it has delivered a 24% return. The company is delivering strong returns this year, even with some fluctuations in iPhone sales. In fiscal Q3 2024, it reported a 14.5% quarter-over-quarter decrease in iPhone sales, totaling over $39.2 billion.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue for the quarter came in at $85.8 billion, which grew by 5% from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company also unveiled significant updates to its software platforms at the Worldwide Developers Conference. This included Apple Intelligence, a groundbreaking personal intelligence system that integrates advanced, private generative AI models into the core of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Baron Funds highlighted the strengths in the company\u2019s business in its Q2 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the firm has to say about AAPL:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in\u00a0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nBeing a dividend payer, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a strong cash position. In the most recent quarter, the company reported an operating cash flow of $29 billion. It returned $32 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company holds a 12-year streak of consistent dividend growth, which makes it one of the best innovative stocks that pay dividends. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.45%, as of September 18.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a popular stock among elite funds during Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The hedge fund positions in the company jumped to 184 in Q2, from 150 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a collective value of more than $124 billion.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best innovative stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other American tech stocks.\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term leadership in the consumer electronics market by focusing on a high-end, closely connected ecosystem of products, services, and software. Apple's flagship iPhone is the central component of this ecosystem, accounting for 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Hence, providing it with pricing power, switching costs, and network impact. All other Apple products and services get the most value from keeping users within this walled garden. With this strategy, the company has growth potential and makes it unique.\nThe California-based tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence, an AI-powered personal system for its new smartphones, in fiscal Q3 2024, perhaps sparking an iPhone upgrade super cycle. Sales of iPhones reached $39.3 billion YoY, and Mac revenue increased 2% to $7 billion YoY, contributing to the company's $85.8 billion in revenue, a 5% YoY gain. AAPL's economic moat is bolstered by its solid financial history, which includes growth in net income and revenue over the last ten years.\nMorningstar analysts upgraded their estimation of the company's fair value from $170 to $185 due to an improvement in their projection for iPhone revenue. Analysts predict strong iPhone-driven growth in 2025 and 2026, pushed by improvements to Apple's artificial intelligence technologies. However, they still believe the firm's stock is expensive, with the present price reflecting an unsustainable 20% iPhone revenue increase in fiscal 2025 amid headwinds in China and slowing upgrade cycles.\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc.

Investors have been eagerly waiting for this news since June. This integration will allow eligible U.S. users to split their purchases into biweekly or monthly payments, leveraging Affirm's buy now, pay later (BNPL) services.\nThis move provides Apple Pay users the ability to check out online or in-app with flexible payment plans, including 0% APR options for some purchases.

        "Text": "CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Apple on Monday charged into the artificial intelligence craze with a new iPhone lineup that marks the company\u2019s latest attempt to latch onto a technology trend and transform it into a cultural phenomenon.\nThe four different iPhone 16 models will all come equipped with special chips needed to power a suite of AI tools that Apple hopes will make its marquee product even more indispensable and reverse a recent sales slump.\nApple\u2019s AI features are designed to turn its often-blundering virtual assistant Siri into a smarter and more versatile sidekick, automate a wide range of tedious tasks and pull off other crowd-pleasing tricks, such as creating customized emojis within seconds.\nAfter receiving a standing ovation for Monday's event, Apple CEO Tim Cook promised the AI package will unleash \u201cinnovations that will make a true difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nBut the breakthroughs won't begin as soon as the new iPhones \u2014 ranging in price from $800 to $1,200 \u2014 hit the stores on Sept. 20.\nMost of Apple\u2019s AI functions will roll out as part of a free software update to iOS 18, the operating system that will power the iPhone 16 rolling out from October through December. U.S. English will be the featured language at launch but an update enabling other languages will come out next year, according to Apple.\nIt\u2019s all part of a new approach that Apple previewed at a developers conference three months ago to create more anticipation for a next generation of iPhones amid a rare sales slump for the well-known devices.\nSince Apple\u2019s June conference, competitors such as Samsung and Google have made greater strides in AI \u2013 a technology widely expected to trigger the most dramatic changes in computing since the first iPhone came out 17 years ago.\nJust as Apple elevated fledgling smartphones into a must-have technology in 21st-century society, the Cupertino, California, company is betting it can do something similar with its tardy arrival to artificial intelligence.\nIn an attempt to set itself apart from the early leaders in AI, the technology being baked into the iPhone 16 is being promoted as \u201cApple Intelligence.\u201d Despite the unique branding, Apple\u2019s new approach mimics many of the features already available in the Samsung Galaxy S24 released in January and the Google Pixel 9 that came out last month.\n\u201cApple could have waited another year for further development, but initial take up of AI-powered devices from the likes of Samsung has been encouraging, and Apple is keen to capitalize on this market,\u201d said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore.\nAs it treads into new territory, Apple is trying to preserve its longtime commitment to privacy by tailoring its AI so that most of its technological tricks can be processed on the device itself instead of relying on giant banks of computers located in remote data centers. When a task needs to connect to a data center, Apple promises it will be done in a tightly controlled way that ensures no personal data is stored remotely.\nWhile corralling the personal information shared through Apple\u2019s AI tools inherently reduces the chances the data will be exploited or misused against a user\u2019s wishes, it doesn\u2019t guarantee iron-clad security. A device could still be stolen, for instance, or hacked through digital chicanery.\nFor those seeking to access even more AI tools than being offered by the iPhone, Apple is teaming up with OpenAI to give users the option of farming out more complicated tasks to the popular ChatGPT chatbot.\nAlthough Apple is releasing a free version of its operating system to propel its on-device AI features, the chip needed to run the technology is only available on the iPhone 16 lineup and the high-end iPhone 15 models that came out a year ago.\nThat means most consumers who are interested in taking advantage of Apple\u2019s approach to AI will have to buy one of the iPhone 16 models \u2014 a twist that investors are counting on will fuel a surge in demand heading into the holiday season.\nThe anticipated sales boom is the main reason Apple\u2019s stock price has climbed by more than 10% since the June developers conference, including a slight uptick Monday after the shares initially slipped following the showcase for the latest iPhones. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives was so impressed with what he saw Monday that he predicted the new AI iPhones will propel Apple's market value through the $4 trillion threshold next year for the first time. That forecast translates into increase of roughly 20% from Monday's closing price of $220.91 for Apple's stock.\nBesides its latest iPhones, Apple also introduced a new version of its smartwatch that will include a feature to help detect sleep apnea as well the next generation of its wireless headphones, the AirPods Pro, that will be able to function as a hearing aid with an upcoming software update.\n"

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) - Shares in European hearing aid makers slipped in early trading on Tuesday after Apple rolled out hearing aid features.\nApple said its AirPods Pro 2 could now be \"transformed\" into a personalized hearing aid via an upcoming software update that would boost specific sounds in real time, including parts of speech or elements within a user's environment.\nShares in Italy's Amplifon dropped as much as 7.2% earlier in the session and were down 5.7% by 0845 GMT. Other hearing aid makers, Sonova, Demant and GN Store Nord, fell between 2% and 4%.\nHowever, Jefferies analysts said in a note that Apple's move was not a concern for hearing aid players as over-the-counter (OTC) devices target a different population.\nOTC hearing aids do not compete against prescription-based devices on either technological or service levels, despite their attractive price points, Jefferies added.\n\"The level of fitting does not suffice the need for those, that have severe hearing aid problems and as such, OTC devices are mostly used for those with mild hearing aid problems,\" analysts from Vontobel wrote in a note.\nStill, analysts said the news could be a positive development for the hearing aid industry, as it also raises awareness of the hearing deterioration problems.\n(Reporting by Anastasiia Kozlova and Alessandro Parodi in Gdansk, additional reporting by Agnieszka Olenska and Amir Orusov; editing by Milla Nissi)\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other active stocks.\nThe economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants.\nAs stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\u201cChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC\u2019s Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%.\nHowever, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts.\nIn a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz\u00a0emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial.\nKantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary.\nHe noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support.\nLooking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability.\nKantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy.\nMethodology\nWe sifted through Yahoo Finance's list of the most active stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nVolume: 10.573 million\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 56.172 million\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational corporation best known for its consumer electronics, software, and online services. Famous products include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, renowned for their focus on user experience, innovative design, and ecosystem of services including the App Store and Apple Music.\nThe revenue in FQ3 2024 rose by 4.87% year-over-year, with the services division setting a record at $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. iPhone revenue reached $39.3 billion, despite a slight decline. Moreover, Mac revenue grew by 2% to $7 billion, and iPad revenue by 24% year-over-year.\nShipments for the latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to UBS data. Delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are shorter than last year in major markets.\nIn the US, wait times for the iPhone 16 are 26 days, down from 40 days last year. In China, they're 18 days compared to 36. Despite upcoming Apple Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\nJust a few weeks after launching the new iPhone with Apple Intelligence, the company is likely to unveil new versions of the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini in October. These computers will also come pre-loaded with Apple Intelligence and are expected to rival AI workloads of PCs announced by Microsoft. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) debuted Apple Intelligence in June, its first step into the world of GenAI.\nDespite potential challenges related to iPhone upgrade cycles and the services business, the company's strong brand recognition, innovative product lineup, and expanding ecosystem position it well for continued growth.\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) gained but detracted from relative performance due to our underweight. While the company\u2019s overall and iPhone revenues declined year over year, the unveiling of an upgraded iPad Pro and iPad Air boosted investor sentiment. In particular, the introduction of generative AI features allayed concerns that Apple was not keeping pace with competitors.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 8th on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other big tech stocks.\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of\u00a0 AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an information technology company and the famed manufacturer of the iPhone. It is based in Cupertino, California.\nThis tech giant is by far the largest company in the world and has a reputation that transcends borders. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 was Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) best quarter in quite some time, with revenue growth year-over-year from products like the iPad coming in at 24%. However, many are disillusioned by this company because, despite its reputation, its growth is lagging behind many competitors in the tech space, particularly in terms of sales.\nThe hefty price tags that accompany any Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) product on the market may be the biggest reason why sales seem to be lagging. However, analysts expect the iPhone 16 to bring about a massive change because this new model actually gives users a reason to upgrade. With Apple Intelligence only being available on the latest iPhone models - the 15 and 16 series - now may be the time for Apple enthusiasts to trade up from older models.\nApple Intelligence introduces generative AI on the iOS user interface and marks the first major step Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has taken in the field of AI. This signals to investors that the iPhone maker may finally be catching up with other big tech stocks, a development that is expected to increase growth and profitability in the coming years.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had 184 hedge funds long its stock in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $124.2 billion.\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy.

Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro 2 has integrated hearing aid capability into a consumer device for the first time making it accessible to users.\u201d\nAccording to Bhatia, machine learning models facilitate the enhancement of the user's hearing following a preliminary test, with all consumer devices from Apple integrating the hearing score obtained through the AirPods Pro 2, adjusting their audio output accordingly for the user.\nShe believes the technology will be hard to replicate by rival companies for Android users as it demonstrates the \u201cseamless functionality within Apple's ecosystem.\u201d\nApple has previously developed hearing technology such as the Noise app on Apple Watch, headphone audio levels with iPhone, hearing accessibility features, and the Apple Hearing Study, whereas the AirPods Pro 2 will provide end-to-end experience focused on prevention, awareness, and assistance.\nBhatia concludes that competitors will be quick to respond with similar features to provide for those experiencing hearing loss.\n\u201cThe market potential for this product is substantial.\u201d\nUsing the personalised hearing profile from the Hearing Test, the new feature will transform AirPods Pro into a clinical-grade hearing aid.\nAfter setup, the feature will enable personalised dynamic adjustments so users have the sounds around them boosted in real time.\n\"Apple launches AirPods with clinical-grade hearing aid demonstrating wider trend for heathtech integrated wearables\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a012 best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett.\nWarren Buffett, the most famous investor on Wall Street, needs no introduction, having generated billions of dollars for himself and investors for decades. Throughout his investment career that began in 1965, the \u2018Oracle of Omaha\u2019 has averaged annual\u00a0returns of 19.8%, trumping a gain of 9.9% for the S&P 500 over the same period.\nThe market-beating performance has propelled Buffett to the top of the charts as one of Wall Street\u2019s most revered and followed investors. His investment portfolio is always tracked as investors scan for potential market opportunities.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a010 Best Counter Cyclical and Defensive Stocks to Invest In.\nLikewise, Buffett is one of the most successful investors in Wall Street\u2019s history, having accumulated a fortune of $138 billion. His total assets might have been significantly higher if he hadn\u2019t donated large sums to different charitable causes.\nMarket participants have always applauded his disciplined approach, which entails a long-term perspective. His investment firm has become the latest company to cross the $1 trillion mark on market cap, underlining Buffett\u2019s impressive stock-picking skills. According to Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research, the $1 trillion milestone is a testament to Buffet\u2019s investment firm\u2019s financial strength and franchise value.\nBuffett\u2019s investment strategy has remained constant throughout his career, focusing on the concept of value investing. The strategy focuses on identifying companies that are undervalued but have the potential to increase in value over time. Buffett seeks out companies with a lasting edge over competitors, like a well-established brand, high barriers to entry, and a large and loyal customer base, and he buys into them at a price that ensures a safety margin.\nLikewise, the billionaire investor is well-known for his cautious stance on investing in high-risk, high-reward sectors like technology. Instead, he prefers to invest in more stable sectors such as retail, insurance, and finance. He is recognized for his commitment to long-term investments, holding onto companies for extended periods, and steering clear of frequent trading. This strategy enables him to benefit from the compound interest effect and allows the companies he invests in to mature and produce significant profits.\nBuffett\u2019s cautious approach is evidenced by the fact that his investment firm had\u00a0over $180 billion\u00a0in cash as of the end of the first quarter. The cash reserves were expected to swell to over $270 billion as of the end of June.\nThe cash reserves have been building up as the billionaire investor only invests in finding attractive deals with eye-popping returns. In a 2023 letter to shareholders, Buffett reiterated he did not see the possibility of eye-popping performance.\nBuffett has consistently included dividend stocks in his portfolio, which is a strategy that has effectively generated consistent passive income. This year alone, his investments are projected to generate around $6 billion in dividend earnings.\nNevertheless, Buffett has also been in defensive mode in recent months, opting to reduce stakes in some companies. He has trimmed holdings by up to half in some tech giants, concerned by valuations getting out of hand after a year of gains fuelled by the artificial intelligence frenzy.\nWhile valuations have gotten out of hand going by the blockbuster gains over the past year, there are still opportunities to unlock. With the US Federal Reserve poised to end its monetary easing spree with a cut of interest rates, equity is poised to receive a significant boost.\nThe best long-term stocks to buy, according to Warren Buffett, are companies well poised to benefit from interest rates dropping. Low interest rates make it easier for companies to access cheap capital to accelerate their operations, generating more shareholder value.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our selection of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett, we began by analyzing Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 13F portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within the portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock, as of the end of the second quarter of this year. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order based on the value of Warren Buffett stakes in the companies.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s Latest Investment Stake: $84.25 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes as of Q2: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best long-term stocks to buy, according to Warren Buffett, a consumer tech giant. The company is engaged in developing and selling an array of devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Mac\u2019s wearables, among others.\nThe company\u2019s competitive edge stems from its game-changing devices and solutions that have propelled it to a three trillion dollar empire. Recently, the company unveiled the iPhone 16, a new device expected to reinvigorate growth in its slowing iPhone business. The company is also betting on artificial intelligence as it aims to strengthen its product pipeline to attract more sales.\nAnalysts have touted the new iPhone as a product that could be the most successful iPhone yet, likely to generate more value. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s revenue growth in the past year, up to the third quarter of 2024, has been relatively slow, increasing by just 0.43%. However, there was a significant jump in earnings during the third quarter of 2024, with a notable quarterly increase of 4.87%. This suggests a consistent financial path, though, with a moderate pace of growth.\nAfter rallying for the better part of the year, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not necessarily cheap, as it trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 29. Nevertheless, the premium valuation is expected of a three trillion dollar company that is poised to generate significant value.\nApple remains Buffett\u2019s biggest holdings despite downsizing his stakes by up to 56% in the first two quarters of the year. The oracle of Omaha sold roughly 510 million shares in\u00a0 the tech\u00a0 giant. Nevertheless the company still accounts for about 40% of the portfolio.\nIt remains one of Buffett\u2019s longest investments owing to the fact that it pays a dividend with a yield of 0.45%. Additionally, the company returns value through stock buybacks. By June 2024 end, 184 out of the 912 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey were the firm\u2019s investors. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s largest shareholder is Warren Buffett\u2019s\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway, whose $84.25 billion stake also makes the stock the biggest in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio.\nHere\u00a0is what Mar Vista Focus strategy said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall AAPL\u00a0ranks 1st on our list of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Insiders At Apple Sold US$82m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Over the past year, many Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n See our latest analysis for Apple \nThe Senior VP, Katherine Adams, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$23m worth of shares at a price of US$189 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$217, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 30% of Katherine Adams's holding.\nInsiders in Apple didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Apple. In total, insiders sold US$24m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Apple insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$2.0b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Apple is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Apple you should be aware of.\nBut note: Apple may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase is in talks with Apple about replacing Goldman Sachs as the tech giant's credit-card partner, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\nThe discussions started earlier this year and have advanced in recent weeks, but any potential deal could still be months away, said the source, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier.\nGoldman Sachs declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\nGoldman and Apple reportedly pulled the plug last year on their partnership, which included credit cards and savings accounts.\nGoldman is facing a costly exit from the partnership that is seen by other lenders as too risky and unprofitable, sources told Reuters in December last year.\nAfter its foray into consumer banking flopped, Goldman has refocused on its traditional mainstays - investment banking and trading. The consumer business that CEO David Solomon championed has lost billions of dollars.\nThe card, launched in 2019, was one of the hallmarks of Goldman's retail strategy. Apple and Goldman granted cards to customers with lower credit scores in an attempt to boost revenue, a source told Reuters last year.\nThe card offered perks like \"no fees\" and cashback. But Goldman had to set aside bigger provisions for bad loans, leading to higher paper losses for its consumer business.\nGoldman is also exiting a credit-card partnership with automaker General Motors. Earlier this month, Solomon dismissed the notion that the bank's early exit with GM was messy, saying the bank had anticipated the problems.\nInvestors have supported Goldman's attempt to refocus on its Wall Street operations, pushing its stock up nearly 27% so far this year.\n(Reporting by Nupur Anand, Manya Saini and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Lananh Nguyen and Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Title": "How Much Will Apple Pay Out in Dividends This Year?",
        "Author": "  Collin Brantmeyer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the world's largest company by market capitalization, has generated an impressive total return of 31% over the past year despite its sales growth stalling. One reason beyond its decade-high operating margin and gross margin is that the tech giant is returning an incredible amount of capital to its shareholders.\nSo, let's examine Apple's dividend, its sustainability, and another way it rewards shareholders.\nApple currently distributes a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share after the company increased it earlier this year from $0.24 per share. Year to date, Apple has paid investors $0.74 per share and will likely pay investors an additional $0.25 per share, based on its previous history, for a total of $0.99 in 2024.\nMoreover, Apple management has paid and raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years. According to recent research by Hartford Funds, anytime a company grew or initiated a dividend, its stock had higher returns and less volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since 1973.\nHartford Funds also highlights that a key metric for a dividend-paying stock is its payout ratio, or the percentage of a company's profits paid out as dividends. The research suggests that it is essential for a company to keep its payout ratio below 75%; otherwise, management may need to cut its dividend if its earnings slide. With a payout ratio of only 14.9%, Apple's management should be able to maintain and raise it annually for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to its consistent dividend, Apple is buying back its shares hand over fist. Management has reduced its outstanding shares by 14.5% over the past five years and recently announced a $110 billion share repurchase program in May. So, while Apple's revenue and net income are only up 0.8% and 6.7% year over year through the first nine months of its fiscal 2024, respectively, its capital allocation strategy should keep shareholders happy while it finds new growth opportunities.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 780% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 168% for the S&P 500.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 23, 2024\nCollin Brantmeyer has positions in Apple.

        "Title": "How to buy Apple stock (AAPL)",
        "Author": "  James Royal, Ph.D. ",
        "Text": "Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world and has consistently rewarded investors with strong returns over the past two decades. Its simply designed and innovative products have been highly sought after by consumers for years, and the iPhone, iPad, AirPods and Apple Watch have transformed the categories they compete in.\nIn 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded company to surpass $1 trillion in market value, and is worth $3.4 trillion as of September 2024. The company\u2019s products are synonymous with luxury in the tech industry and have become so intertwined in people\u2019s lives that many can\u2019t live without them.\nHere\u2019s what else you should know about investing in Apple (AAPL) and how to buy shares in the tech giant.\nAnalyzing a company\u2019s competitive position and financials is probably the single hardest part of buying the stock, but it\u2019s also the most important. The best place to begin is with the company\u2019s Form 10-K, which is the annual report that all publicly traded companies must file with the SEC.\nThe 10-K can help you understand a lot about the company:\nhow it makes money and how much\nits assets and liabilities\nits profitability trends over time\nthe competitive landscape\nthe various risks faced by the business\nThe annual report is a great first step at finding out about the company, but you\u2019ll want to do more than this. You\u2019ll want to study what other businesses are doing to compete, because it\u2019s important to have a broader perspective on the industry.\nFor example, Apple competes with the largest companies in the world, all of which have deep financial resources and can attract the smartest employees. Rivals include Microsoft, Google and Meta Platforms (Facebook), and they battle for market share across various domains, such as smartphones, communication apps and virtual reality headsets. Each company has its own agenda in the tech world, and that does not always coincide with how Apple is strategizing.\nInvesting in Apple by the numbers\nApple is the most valuable company in the S&P 500 as of September 2024 and has a market value of about $3.4 trillion.\nApple earned more than $114 billion in operating income and $6.13 in diluted earnings per share during its 2023 fiscal year.\nThe iPhone is Apple\u2019s best-selling product, generating more than $200 billion in revenue and accounting for more than 52 percent of overall sales in 2023.\nApple has split its stock five times since going public, with the most recent split being on a 4-for-1 basis on Aug. 28, 2020.\nApple has been a fantastic performer for many years, and in 2023 the company earned nearly $100 billion. But you\u2019ll need to keep an eye on this growth stock, because the tech world is all about disrupting the established players such as Apple. While legendary investor Warren Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns millions of shares in the stock, that may not mean it\u2019s right for you. Apple does pay shareholders a quarterly dividend, making it more attractive for certain investors who want to earn passive income.\nSo you\u2019ll want to consider the following questions:\nDo you understand the business and its future prospects?\nWill you be able to continue analyzing the company and industry as it grows?\nGiven that stocks can be volatile, will you be able to hold on if it drops, or even buy more?\nDo you have a sense of what the company is worth and how that compares to the current market value?\nApple pays a dividend \u2014 does that fit your needs?\nHow much you can afford to invest has less to do with Apple than with your own personal financial situation. Stocks can be volatile. So, to give your investment time to work out, you\u2019ll likely want to be able to leave the money in the stock for at least three-to-five years. That means you should be able to live without the money for at least that length of time.\nCommitting to holding the stock for three-to-five years is important. You\u2019d hate to have to sell the stock when it\u2019s near a low only to watch it rebound much higher after you exited the position. By sticking to a long-term plan, you\u2019ll be able to ride out the ups and downs of the stock.\nIf you\u2019re investing in individual stocks, you\u2019ll likely want to keep the percentage of any single position between 3 and 5 percent. This way you\u2019re not heavily exposed to one investment breaking your portfolio. If the stock has more business risk, then you might choose an even lower percentage than this range.\nIn addition, rather than just committing a one-time sum of money to the stock, consider how you can add money to your position over time.\nWhile opening a brokerage account may sound like a difficult step, it\u2019s actually quite easy, and you can have everything set up in 15 minutes or so.\nYou\u2019ll want to select a broker that caters to your needs. Are you trading often or infrequently? Do you need a high level of service or research? Is cost the most important factor for you? If you\u2019re buying a few stocks but investing mainly in funds, then a number of brokers specialize in offering commission-free trading for those funds.\n(Here\u2019s Bankrate\u2019s list of best brokers for beginners.)\nAfter you\u2019ve opened your account, you\u2019ll want to fund it with enough money to buy Apple stock. But you can take care of this step completely online, and it\u2019s simple.\nWith Apple shares trading around $220 per share as of September 2024, you may not have enough money to buy an entire share. Several brokers, including Charles Schwab and Fidelity, have started offering fractional shares to help with this problem, allowing you to invest with just a few dollars.\nOnce you\u2019ve decided to buy Apple stock and you\u2019ve opened and funded your brokerage account, you can set up your order. Use the company\u2019s ticker symbol \u2014 AAPL \u2014 when you input your order.\nMost brokers have a \u201ctrade ticket\u201d at the bottom of each page, so you can enter your order. On the broker\u2019s order form, you\u2019ll input the symbol and how many shares you can afford, or the amount you\u2019d like to invest if you\u2019re buying fractional shares. Then you\u2019ll enter the order type: market or limit. A market order will buy the stock at whatever the current price is, while the limit order will execute only if the stock reaches the price that you specify.\nIf you\u2019re buying just a few shares, then you\u2019re likely best off sticking with a market order. Even if you pay a little bit more now for a market order, it won\u2019t affect the long-term performance much if the stock continues to perform well.\nSept. 9, 2024: Apple announces new iPhones, Watches and AirPods. The iPhones are the first to include Apple Intelligence, which offers AI features to users.\nAug. 5, 2024: A U.S. federal judge ruled that Google illegally maintained its monopoly in online search by making billions of dollars in annual payments to Apple in order to be the default search engine used on the iPhone and in the Safari browser.\nAug. 3, 2024: One of Apple\u2019s largest investors, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed that it had sold roughly half of its stake in the company.\nMarch 21, 2024: The U.S. Justice Department sues Apple, accusing the company of monopolizing the U.S. smartphone market by making it difficult for competitors to integrate with the iPhone.\nHow profitable is Apple? In its fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2023, Apple earned more than $114 billion in operating income and diluted earnings per share of $6.13.\nWho are Apple\u2019s largest shareholders? The tech titan\u2019s largest shareholders as of June 30, 2024 are The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street. The three firms hold nearly 20 percent of Apple\u2019s outstanding shares, according to SEC filings.\nWho is Apple\u2019s CEO? Tim Cook was named CEO in August 2011 after Steve Jobs resigned due to health reasons. Prior to taking over as CEO, Cook served as Apple\u2019s chief operating officer and was responsible for its worldwide sales and operations.\nHow many shares of Apple stock are there? As of June 29, 2024, Apple had 15.3 billion shares outstanding, or 15.4 billion diluted shares, which account for things such as stock options.\nDoes Apple pay a dividend? Yes, Apple pays a regular cash dividend of $0.25 per share each quarter, which may be increased over time.\nWhat were Apple\u2019s sales in 2023? In its most recent fiscal year, Apple generated $383.3 billion in net sales. The company is expected to generate $390.3 billion in sales in its fiscal year ending September 2024.\nWho is Apple\u2019s biggest competitor? Apple faces competition from a number of companies in categories such as smartphones, personal computers, tablets and more. Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Amazon would all be considered major competitors to Apple.\nBuying a stock can be exciting, but success won\u2019t happen overnight. Investors should take a long-term perspective on their investments, and they should consider taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging if they believe in the stock for the long haul.\nWith dollar-cost averaging, investors add a set amount of money to their position over time, and that really helps when a stock declines, allowing them to purchase more shares. High-flying stocks can dip from time to time, so the strategy can help you achieve a lower buy price and higher overall profits.\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation.\n"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this week.\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming indispensable for large businesses, providing them with tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug\u200b.\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company\u2019s total sales\u200b. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure\u200b. The company\u2019s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is potentially participating in a funding round for OpenAI, the California-based AI startup that is estimated to be worth around $100 billion, later this year. Experts are divided on the reasons behind the tech giant's possible investment in OpenAI.

While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Apple AirPods 4 review: Still the top choice for a reason",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "I spend the vast majority of my workday listening to music on my AirPods Pro 2. It\u2019s the only way I can concentrate on researching and writing. But at $249, the AirPods Pro 2 are a pricey proposition, which is where Apple\u2019s (AAPL) AirPods 4 come in. An updated version of Apple\u2019s entry-level and mid-range AirPods, the AirPods 4 come in two flavors: a $129 base model and a $179 version with active noise cancellation. We\u2019ll refer to those as \"AirPods 4 with ANC.\"\nI\u2019ve been using both models of AirPods 4 for the past week or so, and so far, I've found them to be far more comfortable than their predecessors, slotting easily into my ears and staying put whether I\u2019m out for a run or cooking dinner, and the audio quality is top-notch for wireless earbuds.\nBetween the two models, I\u2019d opt for the AirPods 4 with ANC; they pack more features and offer a shockingly similar experience to the AirPods Pro 2, though they lack the Pro 2's silicone tips that help block ambient noise. But if you\u2019re in the market for the most affordable option, the standard AirPods 4 are still a solid choice.\nThe AirPods 4 line offers an updated design that Apple says it has refined using years of data to ensure a snug fit whether you opt for the base model or the ANC version. I like the AirPods Pro 2 design, but some users, including my wife, have trouble with the way the changeable silicone tips sit in their ears. The AirPods 4 with ANC should solve that problem, providing noise-cancelling tech without the need for tips.\nBoth versions of the AirPods 4 get voice isolation for better-sounding phone calls and Siri interactions, which allow you to approve or dismiss things like notifications and phone calls by shaking your head up and down for yes or side to side for no. In my testing I had to be fairly deliberate with my movements, so there\u2019s no way I could do this discreetly on the subway without people thinking I\u2019m having an argument with myself. Still, I can see how this could be helpful if I were out for a run or lifting weights and wanted to dismiss or accept a call or notification.\nApple says the machine learning algorithm that enables Siri interactions, which is powered by the company\u2019s H2 chip, should pick up on how you move your head over time, letting you more subtly accept or reject calls.\nBoth AirPods 4 models also come with Apple\u2019s Personalized Volume, which automatically adjusts the volume of what you\u2019re listening to depending on what\u2019s happening around you. So if you\u2019re in a quiet library, Personalized Volume will lower the sound, but if you\u2019re in a crowded room, it will raise it. I usually switch this off since I want to be able to control the volume myself, regardless of where I am.\nThe AirPods 4 also come with Apple\u2019s Force sensor, which allows you to pinch the AirPods\u2019 stems to pause and play music, answer calls, skip and rewind tracks, mute and unmute calls, and call upon Siri. You can also bring up the virtual assistant to do things like message or call people by saying \u201cHey, Siri\u201d or just \u201cSiri.\u201d You don\u2019t, however, get the AirPods Pro 2's swipe controls that let you raise and lower the volume by sliding your fingers up or down their stems.\nApple\u2019s AirPods 4 with ANC use internal and external microphones and speakers to drown out environmental noise. I wore the AirPods 4 with ANC on a cross-country flight from Apple\u2019s Sept. 9 iPhone event in Cupertino, Calif., to New York and was surprised at just how well the earbuds blocked out ambient cabin sounds and engine noise.\nIt felt as though I was using the AirPods Pro 2 I normally wear on flights. That said, Apple specifically explains that the AirPods 4 with ANC are meant to block out low-frequency sounds, not high-frequency noises like a crying baby in the row behind you. That\u2019s where the AirPods Pro 2\u2019s silicone tips come in handy.\nLike the AirPods Pro 2, the AirPods 4 with ANC also get Apple\u2019s Transparency mode, which amplifies environmental sounds, so you can hear what\u2019s going on around you while still listening to music or a podcast. Unlike the Pro 2s, however, the AirPods 4 with ANC won\u2019t include Apple\u2019s upcoming hearing aid feature.\nApple rates the AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with ANC\u2019s battery life at five hours on a single charge. That drops to four hours if you have ANC active on the AirPods 4 with ANC. That\u2019s lower than the six hours the company promised with its third-generation AirPods, but the same as the second-generation AirPods. The charging case gets you the same 30 hours of listening time as the third-gen AirPods.\nThat said, I wore the AirPods with ANC turned on for my roughly five-and-a-half-hour coast-to-coast flight, and while they called it quits before I landed, they certainly lasted more than four hours.\nBoth AirPods 4 models support Apple\u2019s Find My, which lets you locate your devices on a map if you misplace them, but only the ANC model includes a built-in speaker that will play a tone to alert you when they're nearby. Apple says a five-minute charge in the case adds an hour to listening time for both pairs of earbuds.\nFrom their fit to their ease of use, Apple\u2019s AirPods 4 are still some of my favorite earbuds around. If you\u2019re the type of person who isn\u2019t doing much commuting or doesn\u2019t tend to listen to music in loud areas, the base AirPods 4 are the version for you. But if you\u2019re going to be in a noisy office, ride the bus or train, or fly often, the model with ANC is the way to go.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bit more out of your earbuds, though, including improved noise cancellation and the ability to use them as hearing aids, then you\u2019ll need to opt for the AirPods Pro 2. Either way, if you\u2019re an Apple user, you can\u2019t go wrong.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Here's Why It's Time to Follow Warren Buffett and Sell Apple Stock",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) used to be an outsize position of Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B). Although it's still his largest by a decent margin, recent sales of the stock may have some investors questioning whether this will last for much longer. Berkshire has been dumping Apple stock quarter after quarter and now has less than half of its Apple shares remaining.\nI think this is a genius move, and investors should follow suit as the stock has detached itself from the business's current performance.\nThere are several potential reasons for the sell-off, but we can assume Buffett doesn't need the cash. Investors will often sell stocks to raise capital to make other investments. However, Berskhire's cash and short-term investments total nearly $277 billion. With a cash hoard like that, he doesn't really need any more.\nSo why is he selling? According to his comments at Berkshire's 2024 annual shareholders meeting, Buffett is worried about the capital gains tax rate increasing from its current 21% to 28%. As a result, Berkshire is trying to lock in gains at a lower tax rate while it can. Buffett was quick to say that Apple will remain its largest position and that it believes in the company.\nBut could there be something else going on here?\nCould you imagine if Buffett said, \"I am selling Apple stock because the valuation has gotten too high for the actual business performance\"? The stock would crater the next day, and Berkshire wouldn't be able to sell for as high a price. I'm not saying that's what was actually on Buffett's mind here, but there is some truth to that view. Apple isn't the same company that Berkshire bought in early 2016.\nThe company Buffett bought for 12 times earnings is now trading for nearly 35. That's a much higher premium to pay for a stock, especially one that isn't growing much at the moment.\nApple is trading like a stock that is growing its revenue and earnings much faster (like back in 2021), but it isn't doing that and isn't projected to do so anytime soon. Per Wall Street analysts' estimates, Apple will grow its earnings by the following amounts over the next few years:\nYear\nEPS Growth\n2024\n8.6%\n2025\n11.5%\n2026\n12.8%\nData source: YCharts.\nThat's basically a market-matching growth rate. Should a company that essentially matches the market's growth trade for a 50% premium over the S&P 500 index? I'd say no.\nIn fact, if I presented you with this information without Apple's name attached, you'd probably decline to invest. That's why I think dumping Apple stock is a great move, as there are far better investments out there than an overpriced stock with hardly any growth potential left.\nApple isn't a value stock or a growth stock, which makes it a more uncertain investment. With so many better options available in the market today, I think investors would be wise to trim their gains like Buffett and look elsewhere.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Haripriya Suresh and Praveen Paramasivam\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian authorities are set to begin a forensic investigation into the cause of a fire that broke out on Saturday at a Tata Electronics factory that makes components for Apple iPhones, a Tamil Nadu state official said on Sunday.\nThe factory, for which Sunday was a weekly holiday, is unlikely to receive state permission to resume production by Monday, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.\nNeither Tata Electronics nor Apple responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours. Tata Electronics previously said it was investigating the cause and would take steps to safeguard employees and other stakeholders.\nThe incident is the latest in recent years to affect Apple suppliers in India, where the U.S. firm is diversifying its supply chain beyond China and which it sees as a growth market.\nThe fire at the plant in the city of Hosur began in an area used to store chemicals, a fire official told Reuters.\nIt has been \"completely put out\" and fumes have stopped, said district administrative official K.M. Sarayu.\nTwo workers who were hospitalised are likely to be discharged on Sunday, she said.\n\"We can now go in to investigate,\" Sarayu said, adding that a forensic team from state capital Chennai has been dispatched.\nIt was not clear if the fire affected surrounding buildings, one of which is set to start assembling iPhones by year-end.\n(Reporting by Haripriya Suresh, Praveen Paramasivam and Aditya Kalra; Writing by Dhwani Pandya; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other forever stocks to buy now.\nInvestment opportunities are increasingly cropping up as volatility in the equity markets edge higher in response to changes in the investment environment. Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fuelling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value. Additionally, they boast a competitive edge in their respective industries by investing billions of dollars in research and development. In addition, the companies are increasingly spearheading industrial trends and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.\nOur Methodology\nThe best forever stocks offer stability and growth, making them ideal for long-term investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the go-to company for any investor eyeing exposure to developing and selling high-profile devices at the heart of the digital revolution. One of the reasons it remains one of the best forever stocks to buy now has to do with the iPhone product line. While the iPhone business has come under pressure in recent years, it has found a new lease of growth with the integration of AI in the iPhone 16, which is expected to fuel demand and drive sales.\nWhile the focus has always been on the hardware business, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-term prospects remain intact as the services business is increasingly becoming an important part of underlying growth. The segment grew by 11% in the first quarter of the year, up from 3% growth last year.\nWith more than 2.2 billion active Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices in circulation, Apple is well positioned to generate significant revenues by selling various services through App Store sales, advertising revenue, AppleCare+, subscription services like Apple TV+, and more.\nThe company remains in a solid financial position, having exited the first quarter with $39.895 billion in operating cash flow and a free cash flow of about $37.5 billion. With a market cap of over $3 trillion, a debt portfolio of $101 billion is insignificant for a company that generates a free cash flow of upwards of $30 billion. Likewise, the company returns value to shareholders with a dividend yield of 0.46% while offering buybacks.\nBy June 2024 end, 184 out of the 912 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey were the firm\u2019s investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other big name stocks.\nIn early April 2024, Goldman Sachs Inc.\u2019s data revealed that short selling on individual US-listed stocks was at the highest level in 6 months, and the most targeted sectors were technology, telecom, and media. This increase in short positions was seen after the significant ~9% advance seen in 1Q 2024 for the S&P 500. As per the data, some hedge funds that were using long-short equity strategies have started to fight the rally.\nDuring extreme market volatility, short selling has become pronounced and has drawn significant interest from institutional and retail investors. It has prompted regulatory intervention as new reporting requirements have been issued by the SEC to offer transparency and ensure the availability of short position data.\nIn the 2Q 2024, the US and Canadian markets saw an increase of\u00a0~$58 billion in short interest or a rise of 5.1% from the previous quarter.\nRecently, S3 Partners, a renowned tracker of short-interest data, reported that the sectors that saw the largest increases in short exposure in 2Q 2024 included information technology (a rise of $49.3 billion), communication services (at $11.2 billion), and utilities (a rise of $3.7 billion) from the previous quarter. The sectors that saw the largest decrease in short exposure were the energy and financial sectors, down $12.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\nEarlier in 2024, a significant surge in\u00a0the leading AI giant\u00a0resulted in losses of\u00a0~$3 billion for the short sellers. Some market experts even described this as an \u201cAI-generated nightmare.\u201d\nIn global equities, short interest climbed during July 2024, with strong increases seen throughout the Automobile (+13bps), REITs (+11bps), and Consumer Durables (+11bps) sectors, reported S&P Global. On the other hand, the largest decreases were in the Financial Services (-10bps) and Real Estate Management and Development (-4bps) sectors.\nTalking about the US equities, the average short interest decreased to 77 basis points during July 2024. Significant increases in short interest were seen throughout REITs (+6 basis points) and the Household and Personal Products (+8 basis points) sectors. Conversely, the largest declines were in the Financial Services (-15 basis points) and the Automobile (-9 basis points) sectors.\nS3 Partners revealed that there is a relatively weak correlation between short positions in certain assets and distress measures. This means that not all heavily shorted stocks are facing difficulties. As per the firm, broader market sentiments and valuation concerns are some of the factors that can drive short interest.\nThe company believes that shorting an asset can form part of broader strategies or hedging activities not linked to distress. It mentioned that there can be 3 measures of bearishness for stocks \u2014- average analyst ratings (From 1 to 5), Credit default swap (CDS) spreads,\u00a0and Altman Z-Score.\nFor example, the US Dollar had a low short position of ~1.32%. However, it had a high CDS spread of 1000 basis points. This indicates high perceived distress on the currency even though there is minimal short interest. This can be because of factors such as currency market dynamics or investor sentiments.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "Text": "Apple has been ordered to pay \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) to Ireland after losing a decade-long fight with the European Union over \u201csweetheart\u201d tax breaks.\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled on Tuesday that Apple had benefited from years of illegal state aid by receiving unfair tax support from the Irish government.\nMargrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition chief, had ordered the company to pay Ireland the fee in 2016 after a two-year investigation. However, the ruling had been overturned by a lower EU court in 2020 after Apple appealed against the decision.\nThe CJEU is the EU\u2019s highest court, meaning the decision cannot be appealed against and the funds will now have to be released to the Irish government. They have been frozen in an escrow account since 2018.\nThe decision is a boost for Ms Vestager\u2019s tax crackdown on US multinationals after she was previously defeated in a separate case involving Amazon before the CJEU.\nIn its latest ruling, the CJEU said: \u201cOn appeal, the Court of Justice sets aside the judgment of the General Court and gives final judgment in the matter, conversely confirming the Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d\nIn 2016, Ms Vestager said the Irish tax authority had allowed Apple to benefit from tax rates as low as 0.005pc since 1991, meaning it underpaid billions of euros in taxes.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, had called the original ruling \u201ctotal political crap\u201d.\nThe company says it has now paid $20bn (\u00a315bn) in taxes on the relevant profits in the US.\nAn Apple spokesman said: \u201cThis case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to. We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal.\n\u201cApple is proud to be an engine of growth and innovation across Europe and around the world, and to consistently be one of the largest taxpayers in the world. The European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and ignore that, as required by international tax law, our income was already subject to taxes in the US.\n\u201cWe are disappointed with today\u2019s decision as previously the General Court reviewed the facts and categorically annulled this case.\u201d\nIn a separate case on Tuesday, the CJEU upheld a \u20ac2.4bn fine for Google first ordered in 2017 after the EU found that it had abused its search dominance to boost its shopping service.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $222.50, denoting a -0.12% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.54% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.72%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.65%.\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's stock has dropped by 0.87% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.3% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.86%.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Apple to post earnings of $1.60 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 9.59%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $94.52 billion, indicating a 5.61% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.70 per share and a revenue of $390.63 billion, signifying shifts of +9.3% and +1.92%, respectively, from the last year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn terms of valuation, Apple is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 33.23. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.05.\nIt's also important to note that AAPL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.62. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Micro Computers industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.63.\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

        "Title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among the Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now",
        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\nThe aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.\nThe financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.\nWhile the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.\nStill, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:\n\u201c...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.\u201d\nJust last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.\nHe discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.\nThe S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.\nRecently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.\nAccording to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.\nMethodology\nWe first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024. We then selected 10 stocks from these Fortune 500 companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nMarket Capitalization as of September 14: $3383.75 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world's largest technology companies by revenue, known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.\nThe revenue in FQ3 2024 was up 4.87% year-over-year and reached $85.78 billion. The services division set a record at $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. iPhone revenue reached $39.3 billion, despite a slight decline. Moreover, Mac revenue grew 2% to $7 billion, and iPad revenue surged 24% year-over-year.\nThe company also launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone event in September unfolded as anticipated, with attention shifting to pre-order data and sales figures for the new iPhone. A survey by US AlphaWise indicated that about 60% of customers planning to upgrade are doing so because of Apple Intelligence. Even more advanced AI features will further roll out in 2025.\nOn August 29, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is considering a significant investment in OpenAI, alongside NVIDIA, as part of a funding round led by Thrive Capital that would value OpenAI at $100 billion.\nCurrently, 184 hedge funds are long AAPL. Berkshire Hathaway has the highest stake in the company, with a position of $84,248,000,000.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best Fortune 500 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Retirement portfolios should always include a mix of large-cap stocks (those that are higher value) \u2014 often companies with time-tested brands and history \u2014 and smaller-cap stocks, which might vary in price.\nWhen it comes to large-cap stocks, look no further than Apple, the electronics leader valued at $3.35 trillion. That\u2019s right \u2014 the tech company is worth more than the United Kingdom\u2019s GDP.\nCheck Out: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\nRead Next: 9 Easy Ways To Build Wealth That Will Last Through Retirement\nDepending on the week, it seems like Apple stock (AAPL) is either trending madly upward or experiencing a worrisome drop as it battles rival companies in China, with investing experts shrieking to \u201cbuy, buy, buy\u201d or hold off altogether. For example, in June, Apple secured better profit results than expected, bumping the stock value. However, not long after that, the Oracle of Omaha himself (aka Warren Buffett) shared that Berkshire Hathaway had dumped a significant amount of the stock, which worried investors. It turns out Buffett was just worried about capital gains taxes increasing and wanted to keep his gains and losses in balance.\nRegardless of its ups and downs, even on its worst days, it\u2019s unlikely that Apple will ever lose enough value to become a bad investment. Here are just a few reasons why you should probably include Apple stock in your retirement portfolio.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nIf Apple\u2019s solid historical performance isn\u2019t reason enough to invest in the company, now might be a great time before prices rise again. Some analysts are suggesting that iPhone\u2019s new AI integrations might encourage consumers to upgrade to the iPhone16 in the fall, boosting sales and potential stock price.\nFurthermore, Daniel Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, told Investors Business Daily that as many as 270 million iPhones are overdue for an upgrade.\nLearn More: 8 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024\nFurthermore, while Apple makes its revenue on a steady stream of tried-and-true products people have come to know and love, it\u2019s also constantly innovating. Who remembers the iPod, after all, which revolutionized digital music? And the iPad was among the first tablets to bring streaming entertainment to screens smaller than laptops but bigger than phones. Now that the company is working AI algorithms into more of its programming, everything from iPhones to Apple Watches to MacBooks will stay on the cutting edge of tech evolution, if not outright drive it.\nApple hasn\u2019t stopped at just making technology \u2014 once it got a foothold in the streaming entertainment business through Apple TV, it\u2019s gone on to make some incredible, innovative and award-winning unique programming that can\u2019t be found on other platforms. This year alone, Apple TV-produced shows have garnered over 72 Emmy nominations, including limited series like \u201cLessons in Chemistry\u201d and the ongoing \u201cSlow Horses.\u201d\nMoreover, Apple is known for great customer service via its fishbowl Apple stores, which are equal parts showrooms and IT service centers. This helps to build consumer confidence and keeps Apple at the top of the tech food chain.\nPerhaps in response to slower phone sales, this year Apple also revealed a stock buyback program that is the biggest in company history, buying back $110 billion of stock. This sent its stock price up by 6%, due to trading.\nThere are more reasons than not to keep Apple in your portfolio. Whether its on an upward trend or a downward one now, by the time you retire, you\u2019re likely to reap the benefits of its continued growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Reasons A Financial Advisor Could Boost Your Savings in 2024\nFlorida's Retirees Are Fleeing: Experts Predict These 5 States Will Be Top Retirement Spots in 10 Years\n3 Things to Do This Week If You Have Debt\n7 Best New Items To Buy at Big Lots Ahead of Halloween 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Reasons You Should Add Apple Stock to Your Retirement Portfolio\n"

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Oppenheimer analysts believe Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Vision Pro remains unthreatened by Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s recently showcased AR glasses prototype, Orion.\nDespite Orion's impressive features, including its lightweight design (around 100 grams) and a wide 70-degree field of view (FOV), the analysts suggest it is not yet a competitor to Apple's Vision Pro.\nThe key reason for this, according to Oppenheimer, lies in Orion's cost and market readiness.\n\"Our checks indicate that Orion's bill-of-materials cost easily exceeds $3,000 compared to the Vision Pro's $2,000,\" the firm states.\nA significant portion of this cost is said to come from the silicon carbide (SiC) wafer used in Orion, which is priced at over $350 per pair of glasses.\nOppenheimer explains that this is before considering additional costs for coating and lithography.\nThey add that while Meta's use of SiC contributes to Orion's impressive FOV, it also drives up costs, making the product less commercially viable in the near term.\nMost AR glasses on the market use glass with a high refractive index, which is cheaper but offers a smaller FOV.\n\"Higher refractive index enables higher FOV in AR glasses,\" Oppenheimer explains, noting that Meta's choice of SiC gives Orion a competitive edge in terms of FOV but complicates cost management.\nThe analysts also point out that while Orion's light weight and FOV are impressive, its display resolution and refresh rate lag behind those of Apple's Vision Pro.\nThey assert that \"resolution and speed of display are as important to good user experience as weight and FOV.\"\nOppenheimer concludes that Orion's advanced design is years away from reaching the commercial scalability that Apple's Vision Pro will achieve by 2024, keeping Apple in a strong competitive position.\nRelated Articles\nShould Apple worry about Meta's AR glasses product Orion?\nChina's stimulus-led stock rally pulls Asia and Europe higher; oil falls\nUBS downgrades Siemens Healthineers citing China market challenges\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Global tech giants halved their business flight emissions in 2023 compared to 2019, but companies like Apple and Google's parent Alphabet are falling behind, risking a return to pre-pandemic levels, a Brussels-based NGO said in a report.\nBusiness travel last year approached pre-pandemic levels but trailed behind leisure trips, as geopolitical conflicts and a slower rebound in key markets hindered full recovery.\nEmissions from corporate flights by 26 major tech companies analysed by Travel Smart, a campaign led by Transport & Environment (T&E) dropped by an average of 49% in 2023, it found.\nWhile this shows that many tech firms are on the right path, only seven have set specific reduction targets that are essential to keeping business flight numbers in check, T&E said.\nAlphabet, which has not set a goal to cut emissions, and Apple, which set a broader target, are slowly creeping back toward 2019 levels, T&E said.\nThe two were among the worst performers, with reductions in corporate travel emissions of just 23% and 31% in 2023, respectively.\n\"How can (Google chief) Sundar Pichai say that Google is progressing to a sustainable future when its travel emissions are going in the wrong direction?\" said Denise Auclair, corporate travel manager at T&E.\nMicrosoft, IBM, and SAP, despite significant cuts, are also at risk as they are among the companies that fly the most without having set reduction goals, T&E said.\n\"Tech companies have claimed to be climate leaders for a long time and many have substantially reduced their business travel emissions, but if they want to be credible they must set reduction targets,\" Auclair added.\nAsked about its performance, Apple said it has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 55% since 2015 as part of its goal to become carbon-neutral by 2030.\n\"We're achieving this by making reductions across our entire carbon footprint \u2014 including business travel \u2014 and implementing significant cuts to the largest sources of our emissions,\" a spokesperson for Apple told Reuters.\nOther companies were not immediately available for comment.\n(Reporting by Dagmarah Mackos; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n"

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nBarclays recently published a list of stocks that could be impacted if Donald Trump comes to power and implements his tariffs plan against China. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was part of the list. Barclays said it chose these stocks \u201cbased on a bottom-up approach, using factual input on global supply chain exposure.\u201d\nApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone event went more or less as expected and all eyes are now on pre-order data and actual numbers on the new iPhone. A survey by US AlphaWise showed about 60% of customers planning to upgrade their iPhone said Apple Intelligence is a key part of the rationale behind the upgrade.\nAlmost all bull cases around Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0are based on the assumption that millions of people would upgrade their iPhones mainly due to AI. However, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nOverall, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Morgan Stanley's Best Stock Picks: 15 Stocks To Own For 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Morgan Stanley's other stock picks.\nThe tail end of 2024 is seeing a market shift in the stock market as the Federal Reserve has finally signaled that interest rate cuts are on the horizon. This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth.\nIt also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time.\nOne bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was \"vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity.\" To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation.\nMS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we \"do not think a recession is imminent\" and \"remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall.\"\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nReturning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece).\nThe bank believes that small caps \"are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap,\" meaning that their outperformance \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates.\" MS warned that \"softer economic data may constrain\" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%.\nAugust's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. \"The time has come for policy to adjust,\" stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" he added.\nFollowing the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not \"believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges.\" MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration \"may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth.\"\nSubsequently, the bank believes that the percentage of total unemployed accounted for by people who lost their jobs (Job Losers) and the number of total layoffs (Challenger Layoffs) might be more relevant when analyzing the labor market. Job Losers currently sit at 50%, while Challenger Layoffs are less than 50,000 after having jumped to 100,000. In short, this paints a more robust labor market picture that might not signal a recession as the Sahm Rule might have suggested.\nRemaining bearish on small caps, it believes that the \"window for small cap outperformance is too narrow \u2013 requiring \u201cGoldilocks\u201d growth and inflation.\" This sentiment is also echoed in the bank's Vintage Values 2025 stock report, where it comments that its strategists \"currently recommend avoiding small caps, and Vintage Values 2025 reflects that view. It skews heavily toward large-cap stocks: 80% of the names are classified as either mega-cap or large-cap.\" Mind you, this sentiment was also echoed in the 2024 report, verbatim.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks for 2025, we ranked MS' Vintage Value 2025 stock picks by their share price percentage upside based on the bank's price target.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 184\nShare Price Target Upside: 23%\nShare Price Target: $273\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's largest technology company in terms of revenue and market capitalization. With roughly $1.46 billion people using an iPhone worldwide, the phone is the bedrock of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. This is also evident through the fact that 52% of the firm's revenue comes from smartphones, and its sizeable user base has also allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to build a tertiary Services business capable of generating $78 billion in revenue annually. The user base is baked into the firm's share price, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s value is based primarily on its ability to ensure regular iPhone upgrades by keeping users in its fold through a closed ecosystem and unique design. It has also meant that the shares have managed to avoid Wall Street's AI jitters in 2024, as while enterprise AI players like MSFT are down by 7.9% since the July peak, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares have lost just 1.70%. The ability to monetize AI and ensure regular upgrades are the two pillars of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis.\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cRecent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Morgan Stanley's best stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

All three versions of the smartwatch \u2014 the SE, standard Series line and Ultra \u2014 will get upgraded. And the two lower-end AirPods models will get the most significant update in their history.\nA lack of recent upgrades has weighed on sales of Apple\u2019s wearables division, which also includes home products and accessories. The unit\u2019s revenue is poised to decline for the second year in a row during fiscal 2024, which runs through September. But analysts expect the category to bounce back in 2025 with a 6.2% revenue gain to $39.5 billion.\nTwo years ago, Apple released the first Ultra watch \u2014 a bulkier, higher-end model \u2014 raising the overall average selling price of the lineup. That year, it also unveiled the second-generation version of the AirPods Pro, another upscale model. That created a tough sales comparison last year when Apple didn\u2019t release a major AirPods update and only rolled out minor tweaks to the Apple Watch.\nThat\u2019s why Monday\u2019s event is a key moment for the wearables business. The Apple Watch Series 10 \u2014 the mid-level version \u2014 will get a new look, with larger displays packaged into a thinner design. The entry-level AirPods will be redesigned and include a version with active noise cancellation \u2014 something previously only found on the AirPods Pro.\nBy bolstering Apple\u2019s more affordable AirPods, the company could attract new customers to the lineup. In the same vein, the company is planning a revamped low-end Apple Watch SE, a model currently priced at $230.\nFresh momentum from the Apple Watch and AirPods would help offset slow sales elsewhere. The new Vision Pro headset, also part of the wearables segment, hasn\u2019t been a major hit for Apple since its launch in February. The category also includes the Apple TV set-top box, HomePod speaker and Beats headphones.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\nChina Can Avoid Japan\u2019s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea\u2019s Path\nThe Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following\nUS Oil Boom Turns Kamala Harris Into an Unlikely Fracking Supporter\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Hanna Ziady, CNN ",
        "Text": "Apple has lost its fight to dodge a \u20ac13 billion ($14.4 billion) tax bill following a ruling by Europe\u2019s top court Tuesday, which dealt a blow to the world\u2019s most valuable company just a day after the iPhone maker unveiled a host of product upgrades to boost sales.\nThe European Court of Justice also upheld a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) antitrust fine against Google, in a separate decision.\nThe two ECJ rulings are final, which means the companies cannot appeal them.\nThe decisions highlight the European Union\u2019s tough stance on Big Tech, which in recent years has extended to enacting sweeping regulations to curb the power of major tech companies.\nIn the ruling against Apple, the ECJ upheld a 2016 decision by the European Commission, which found that Ireland had granted Apple unlawful state aid that it was required to recover. According to estimates by the EU\u2019s executive arm, Ireland had given Apple \u201cillegal tax benefits\u201d worth \u20ac13 billion.\nAccording to Alex Haffner, a competition partner at London-based law firm Fladgate, Apple will now have to \u201cforgo\u201d \u20ac13 billion that had been kept in an escrow account pending the outcome of the case.\n\u201cPerhaps of more relevance will be the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their\u2026 muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary,\u201d he added.\nThe tax case against Apple was part of a crackdown by the EU\u2019s now outgoing antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on deals between multinationals and EU countries that regulators saw as unfair state aid.\nThe Commission said at the time that Apple had benefited from two Irish tax rulings for more than two decades that artificially reduced its tax burden to as low as 0.005% in 2014.\nApple challenged the ruling, and the EU\u2019s General Court \u2014 the ECJ\u2019s lower-level court \u2014\u00a0upheld\u00a0the challenge in 2020, saying regulators had not met the legal standard to show\u00a0that Apple\u00a0had enjoyed an unfair advantage.\nBut on Tuesday, the ECJ\u2019s higher Court of Justice set aside the judgment of the General Court and sided with the Commission.\n\u201cToday is a huge win for European citizens and tax justice,\u201d Vestager said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe Commission will continue its work on harmful tax competition and aggressive tax planning.\u201d\nApple, meanwhile, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision. \u201cWe always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal,\u201d a company spokesperson added in a statement.\nApple said it had paid more than $20 billion in tax in the United States on the same profits that the Commission argued should have been taxed in Ireland.\nShares of Apple (AAPL) fell more than 1% in premarket trading.\nIn a statement on the ruling, the Irish government said: \u201cThe Irish position has always been that Ireland does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers.\u201d\nSeparately, the court dismissed an appeal lodged by Google and its parent Alphabet against the \u20ac2.4 billion fine levied by the Commission in 2017.\nGoogle was fined for abusing its dominant position in online search by favoring its own price comparison shopping service over those of competitors in more than a dozen European countries.\nAt the time, Vestager said Google\u2019s behavior \u201cdenied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation\u201d by smaller rivals.\nThe Commission\u2019s decision was upheld by the General Court but appealed by the companies. That appeal was dismissed Tuesday, and Google was ordered to also pay the Commission\u2019s legal fees. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) were unchanged in premarket trading.\n\u201cWe are disappointed with the decision of the Court,\u201d a Google spokesperson said, pointing to changes the company had made to shopping ads in Europe in 2017 to comply with the Commission\u2019s decision. The new approach had generated \u201cbillions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nIn her statement, Vestager said the case against Google was a \u201ccatalyst for change,\u201d challenging the notion that \u201cdigital companies should be left to operate freely.\u201d\n\u201cIt demonstrated that even the most powerful tech companies could be held accountable,\u201d she said.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Title": "Calculating The Fair Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Apple's estimated fair value is US$240 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$221 share price, Apple appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n The US$238 analyst price target for AAPL is 1.1% less than our estimate of fair value\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n Check out our latest analysis for Apple \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$124.0b\nUS$135.5b\nUS$163.8b\nUS$177.5b\nUS$188.0b\nUS$197.2b\nUS$205.5b\nUS$213.0b\nUS$220.1b\nUS$226.8b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x10\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.89%\nEst @ 4.18%\nEst @ 3.67%\nEst @ 3.32%\nEst @ 3.07%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% \nUS$115.6k\nUS$117.7k\nUS$132.7k\nUS$134.1k\nUS$132.4k\nUS$129.4k\nUS$125.7k\nUS$121.5k\nUS$117.0k\nUS$112.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$227b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.5%) = US$4.9t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.9t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.4t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.7t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$221, the company appears about fair value at a 8.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.158. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +2.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share, indicating a change of +8.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $94.12 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $390.22 billion and $424.35 billion estimates indicate +1.8% and +8.8% changes, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries ",
        "Text": "By Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries\nDUBLIN (Reuters) -An EU court order that Apple pay Ireland 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes triggered mixed feelings in Dublin on Tuesday as the government assessed possible reputational damage and rebuffed opposition calls for the cash to be spent quickly.\nIreland had fought the EU back-tax bill alongside Apple since 2016, seeking to defend its position as the location of choice for U.S. multinationals in Europe - and the billions of euros in direct and indirect taxes they bring in each year.\nThe government played down the finding by the Court of Justice of the European Union that it granted the iPhone maker unlawful aid through its tax treatment as an issue \"of historical relevance only\" due to changes in tax rules since.\nBut it reluctantly accepted that it must now take the back taxes held in an escrow fund estimated at 13.8 billion euros.\nFinance Minister Jack Chambers said ministers would \"carefully consider\" in the coming weeks how best to use the money but that it would not be added to next month's budget pot.\nOpposition parties, who have criticised the government's decision in 2016 to join Apple in appealing the ruling, repeated calls for the windfall to be used quickly to fix a housing crisis and help fund stretched services like healthcare.\n\"If they (the government) had their way, the taxpayer would be down more than 13 billion euros... The mind boggles,\" Mary Lou McDonald, leader of the main opposition Sinn Fein party, told reporters.\nThe government has already set out plans to cut taxes and hike spending in an 8.3 billion euro pre-election Oct. 1 budget, to the extent that it will break its own fiscal rule, meant to cap spending growth at 5%.\nIreland is already taking in more tax than it can spend - primarily due to surging corporate tax receipts paid by foreign companies like Apple - and has set up a new sovereign wealth fund it hopes to grow to 100 billion euros by 2035.\nIt expects to take in 24.5 billion euros in corporate tax this year, mainly from big foreign multinationals, and had collected significantly more than expected by the end of August.\nSpending Minister Paschal Donohoe said increasing spending any further now risked stoking inflation again just as it has stabilised at around 1%.\nOther EU countries might also lay claim to part of the funds following Tuesday's final ruling in the antitrust case, although Chambers said it was not yet possible to comment on whether they would do so.\nREPUTATIONAL DAMAGE\nForeign multinationals, attracted in large part due to low tax rates, make up around 11% of the entire labour market in Ireland - twice the workforce they had when the Apple controversy broke in 2013.\nPeter Vale, tax partner at Grant Thornton, said Tuesday's ruling might do temporary damage to Ireland's reputation but was unlikely to impact foreign direct investment.\n\"While it does relate to a bygone era, even last week, (ex-U.S. President Donald) Trump accused Ireland of being a tax haven,\" Vale said. \"We'll vigorously defend that, but it only adds further fuel to the fire to those sort of assertions.\"\nSince the EU order in 2016, Ireland has made a number of changes to its corporate tax code and did the once unthinkable by dropping opposition to giving up its prized 12.5% corporate tax rate as part of an overhaul of global tax rules.\n($1 = 0.9057 euros)\n(Writing by Conor Humphries and Padraic Halpin; Editing by Jason Neely and Catherine Evans)\n"

A custom process of weaving, flattening, laser-welding, grinding, and finely polishing the titanium wire results in precise, interlinking lozenge shapes that provide a luxurious drape, complete with a dual-button, parachute-style buckle secure enough for all water sports. The Titanium Milanese Loop will be available in both natural and black titanium.\nEnhancements to Support Activity on All Terrains and in the Water\nApple Watch Ultra 2 features the brightest display Apple has ever designed at 3000 nits, suited for a wide range of outdoor adventures. GPS accuracy is also essential for many types of activities. The precision dual-frequency GPS of Apple Watch Ultra 2 utilizes advanced satellite and signal models, custom positioning algorithms, and Apple Maps data to provide the most accurate GPS in a sports watch, leading to more accurate distance, route maps, and metrics.\nWith watchOS 11, the new Vitals app gives users a way to quickly view key overnight health metrics and gain better context when it comes to their health. The new training load feature offers an insightful new way to measure how the intensity and duration of workouts are impacting a user\u2019s body over time. An Up Next view for Custom Workouts helps users keep track of their current and upcoming interval.\nThe Action button can be customized to make it even easier to start a workout, switch between workout types during a Multisport workout, and more. With watchOS 11, users can now conveniently switch actions at any time by pressing and holding the Action button. This gives users quick access to useful features like Stopwatch, Backtrack, and Flashlight, and a variety of new options, including Translation, Voice Memos, and Shazam\u00ae.\nTo help users plan and enjoy open water activities and stay aware of changing conditions, watchOS 11 introduces a new Tides app for Apple Watch. Users can access seven rolling days of forecasted tidal information for coastlines and surf spots around the globe, including information on high and low tides; rising and falling tides; tide height and direction; and sunrise and sunset, all plotted against a timeline. Users can also view beaches near their location on a convenient map, and new complications show current tide information for their favorite spots or the closest beaches at a glance.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 is the best sports watch for athletes and adventurers of all kinds:\nRunners get advanced metrics, customizable workout views with Heart Rate Zones, Race Route, an industry-first automatic track-running detection feature, Custom Workouts, and more experiences during workouts and races alike. Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers battery life for long runs, with up to 12 hours during outdoor workouts, or up to 35 hours with all low-power settings.\nCyclists can easily view their workout as a Live Activity on iPhone\u00ae \u2014 or connect Bluetooth-enabled cycling accessories to Apple Watch Ultra 2 \u2014 giving them more metrics and experiences, including cadence, an automatic estimate of functional threshold power, and Power Zones. Apple Watch Ultra 2 can also track distance, speed, elevation, and heart rate.\nSwimmers can make use of automatic stroke detection and lap count on Apple Watch Ultra 2, which is certified to WR100. watchOS 11 brings Custom Workouts for pool swims, which help users track their intervals and give them a snapshot of what\u2019s next. Users can also view water temperature directly within the Workout app during Pool Swim and Open Water Swim workouts.\nHikers can enjoy enhanced trail experiences with offline maps \u2014 complete with turn-by-turn directions \u2014 as well as features like Waypoints and backtrack GPS data in the Compass app. Users can also create and save custom hiking routes in iOS 18 and sync them to Apple Watch.\nDivers can take advantage of the Oceanic+ app \u2014 developed in partnership with Huish Outdoors \u2014 which turns Apple Watch Ultra into a dive computer.2 This year, the Oceanic+ app introduces new features for snorkelers, allowing them to easily view popular locations nearby and access information about weather, as well as water temperature and tidal conditions provided by the snorkeling community. All snorkeling adventures are archived in a user\u2019s personal logbook, including their route and underwater photos. Photos can be automatically color-corrected and analyzed against a comprehensive, localized database to help users identify fish.\nGolfers benefit from Apple Watch Ultra 2 with Apple\u2019s brightest display ever and long battery life. With a suite of third-party apps, users can access course information as well as tools and insights utilizing the high-frequency motion API to help improve their game.\nWith its rugged, corrosion-resistant titanium design, large bright display, and long battery life, Apple Watch Ultra 2 is also great for rowing, skiing, snowboarding, tennis, and many other activities.\nInsightful Sleep Apnea Notifications\nSleep apnea is a potentially serious condition where breathing stops momentarily during sleep. The condition, which is estimated to impact more than 1 billion people worldwide, goes undiagnosed in most cases, and if left untreated, can have important consequences on health. Building on the intelligent health features already available, Apple Watch now offers a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea.3\nTo detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. While some breathing disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep, and when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. The new sleep apnea algorithm analyzes breathing disturbance data so Apple Watch can notify the user if the data indicates signs of sleep apnea. The notification will include the time period when potential sleep apnea occurred, educational materials on the importance of seeking treatment, and a PDF providing three months of breathing disturbance data to reference during a conversation with a healthcare provider.\nThe sleep apnea notification feature was developed with advanced machine learning methods, validated in a clinical study, and is expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon. Sleep apnea notifications will be available in more than 150 countries and regions this month, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.\nAudio Playback Through Speakers\nFor the first time, audio can play back through the two built-in speakers on Apple Watch Ultra 2. Just like with phone calls, users can listen to audio from a range of apps \u2014 including Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and third-party apps\u2014 right from their Apple Watch.\nAdditional watchOS 11 Features\nApple Watch Ultra 2 also features many other enhancements with watchOS 11:\nActivity rings are more customizable than ever, with the ability to specify Activity ring goals by the day of the week so the rings provide the right amount of motivation at the right moments. Users can also pause their rings for a day, week, month, or more without affecting their award streaks, allowing users to plan a rest day, care for an injury, or just take a day off.\nThe Workout app offers even more workout types that can track distance using enhancements in GPS positioning, including various field sports, Downhill Skiing, Cross Country Skiing, Snowboarding, Golf, Outdoor Rowing, and more. Users can also see their route maps for more workout types.\nwatchOS 11 also features a more intelligent Smart Stack to help users quickly access important information; a new Photos watch face that uses machine learning to help users select and compose their best photo options; the Translate app and Check In on Apple Watch; the ability to scroll through any app with the double tap gesture; summarized notifications powered by Apple Intelligence\u2122 forwarded from iPhone;4 and more.\nApple Watch Herm\u00e8s Ultra 2\nThe first-of-its-kind Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s Ultra 2 combines a natural titanium case with the new Herm\u00e8s En Mer band in Bleu Nuit \u2014 a dark navy color \u2014 and a special Herm\u00e8s Maritime watch face. The En Mer band features Herm\u00e8s\u2019s nautical, diagonal rib pattern made from high-density textured knit, providing both durability and comfort. A wide titanium buckle on the band ensures that Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s Ultra 2 stays securely on the wrist even during water activities, including scuba diving, sailing, and high-speed water sports.\nThe new Herm\u00e8s Maritime watch face features high-visibility numerals in the classic Herm\u00e8s Cape Cod typeface, with a sweeping outer bezel that displays the seconds. Pressing the Action button transforms the watch face into a special countdown timer inspired by boat racing.\nPricing and Availability\nCustomers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the UAE, the U.K., the U.S., and more than 49 other countries and regions can pre-order Apple Watch Ultra 2 in black titanium today, with availability in stores beginning Friday, September 20.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 starts at $799 (U.S.), and is available in natural and black titanium.\nApple Watch Herm\u00e8s Ultra 2 is $1,399 (U.S.).\nNew bands, including the Titanium Milanese Loop, will be available to order today from apple.com/store and in the Apple Store\u00ae app, with availability in stores beginning Friday, September 20.\nwatchOS 11 will be available for Apple Watch Series 6 or later on Monday, September 16, and requires iPhone Xs or later, running iOS 18.

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other 5G stocks.\n5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the latest evolution in mobile networks, which is designed to significantly improve speed, reduce latency, and enhance the capacity and connectivity of mobile devices. A Market Research Future report estimates that in 2024, the 5G market is projected to be worth $15.03 billion, and by 2032, it could reach $229.41 billion. This rapid increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.60% during the forecast period. According to some experts, 5G is one of the most important trends in technology along with artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn a CNBC interview at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai on June 26, director-general of the GSM Association, Mats Granryd highlighted the deep connection between 5G and AI and suggested that their mutual rise is not accidental. He said that \u201cAI feeds off 5G and 5G feeds off AI.\u201d\u00a0 This is especially evident in China, where the development of standalone 5G networks is well advanced and discussions are already shifting toward 5G Advanced (5.5G). While some countries lag, like the Philippines, Mats pointed out that this dynamic between 5G and AI is most prominent in regions with widespread 5G coverage.\nWhen asked about the rivalry between countries like the U.S. and China in AI and 5G, Mats said that such competition is insignificant. He said that from his experience on the GSMA board, which represents the 25 largest mobile operators globally, the focus is on creating common standards and specifications rather than competing.\nHe talked about the difficulties of the 2G and 3G eras when different technologies created challenges for global connectivity. The shift to a unified 4G standard was a pivotal moment that laid the foundation for the digital economy.\nMats believes that 5G will follow a similar path to become a common platform worldwide, which will also extend to AI. While some regions may advance faster than others initially, he showed confidence in the fact that everyone will eventually catch up and benefit from the integration of AI with 5G.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs to identify companies involved in the 5G market. We then selected 10 stocks with the smallest short interest and listed them in descending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nShort Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 0.77%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. It is known for its innovative consumer electronics, software, and services, and is best known for its flagship products including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The company also offers a suite of services such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay. It takes the 3rd spot on our list of best 5G stocks according to short sellers.\nApple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5G journey started with its iPhone 12 in 2020 and it supported more 5G frequencies than any of its competitors in the market. While the company still uses Qualcomm modems, KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the company has plans to launch two iPhone models with its in-house 5G modem in 2025.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took the first major step toward the development of its modems when it agreed to acquire the majority of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business for $1 billion in 2019. The acquisition brought around 2,200 Intel employees, intellectual property, and equipment to Apple. Ming-Chi Kuo believes that a fourth-generation iPhone SE in the first quarter and a new ultra-thin iPhone 17 in the third quarter could have the company\u2019s own modems.\nIn the second quarter, 184 hedge funds had stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at a combined value of $124.175 billion. As of Q2,\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0owns 400 million shares of the company, worth $84.25 billion, making it the most prominent shareholder.\nMar Vista Investment Partners, LLC\u00a0stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd\u00a0in our list of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer Thinks These 10 Stocks Deserve Your Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer thinks deserve attention.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold off on selling stocks, anticipating a rebound once the market\u2019s downturn ended. This strategy proved effective as the average investor saw gains, with the Dow rising by 484 points or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing by 1.16%. This performance suggests that selling during Friday\u2019s decline was not the best move.\n\u201cLast week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday\u2019s downturn wasn\u2019t the best strategy.\u201d\nThe previous week was challenging for economically sensitive stocks and tech stocks, despite the August employment report showing modest growth and a downward revision for July. The recent report seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts, as it presented a balanced scenario of neither too strong nor too weak. Nonetheless, Wall Street reacted negatively, with investors moving away from cyclical stocks in favor of recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals. Industrials and semiconductors were particularly affected.\nJim Cramer observed that on Monday, recession-proof stocks such as pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform strongly. However, this trend is concerning as these stocks have surged significantly and might be due for a correction.\n\u201cRecession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.\u201d\nAccording to Cramer, historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it\u2019s a signal to shift investment strategies. With the Fed moving towards easing and a rate cut expected next week, Cramer suggests it\u2019s time to reconsider holding recession-proof stocks. Instead, investors should look at more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulation. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn can be challenging, anticipating a positive impact from the Fed\u2019s rate cuts could make these stocks attractive.\n\u201cHistorically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it\u2019s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it\u2019s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it\u2019s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It\u2019s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.\u201d\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer noted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s iPhone launch event starts at 1 p.m. ET on Monday. He questioned whether artificial intelligence still captures investor interest, especially in light of recent trading trends among AI-related stocks.\n\u201cApple \u2019s iPhone launch event begins at 1 p.m. ET Monday. Does anyone care about artificial intelligence anymore? Seems fair to ask considering the recent trading in stocks lumped into the AI trade.\u201d\nA positive outlook on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is backed by its strong financial performance and promising future. In the third quarter, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported impressive revenue of $85.8 billion, marking a 5% increase from the previous year despite foreign exchange issues. The Services segment saw record revenue of $24.2 billion, driven by more subscriptions and new services. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s profitability remains strong with a 46.3% gross margin and net income of $21.4 billion.\nAlthough iPhone revenue slightly declined, other products like iPads and Macs performed well, with Mac sales boosted by new M3 devices and iPad sales rising 20% year-over-year. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s focus on emerging technologies, such as AI and augmented reality, especially with the upcoming Vision Pro AR headset, positions it well for future growth. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also returned $32 billion to shareholders in Q3 2024 through dividends and share buybacks, reflecting confidence in its long-term financial health.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer Thinks These 10 Stocks Deserve Your Attention. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

For one individual, Edward Corona, a trader and publisher at The Options Oracle, investing in Apple (AAPL) has proven rather lucrative.\nRead More: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\nFind Out: 9 Easy Ways To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nHere\u2019s a bit about Corona, why he chose Apple and two other tech companies he believes could be good investment options.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nCorona said he\u2019s been trading and investing for more than three decades now. About a year ago, he started The Options Oracle, a Substack newsletter where he shares his strategies and insights with others.\nAs for his journey investing in Apple, he said, \u201cApple has been a game changer for many, including myself. As an options trader, AAPL has been and continues to be like a printing press for me and my subscribers, consistently offering optimal technical setups that have led to solid returns.\u201d\nHe added that he\u2019s been trading Apple stock for a long time as well \u2014 and for good reason.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trading Apple for years, drawn to it because of its strong fundamentals and the consistent technical patterns it offers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a reliable stock for generating returns through options strategies, particularly with the way it reacts to market conditions.\u201d\nPart of what makes Apple a solid option is its recent \u2014 and ongoing \u2014 innovations and product launches. On top of that, it\u2019s had strong earnings reports, which have led to greater investor confidence and have bolstered the stock even more.\nPlus, even in the face of economic changes, Apple has proven itself time and time again as a company with strong fundamentals and the ability to weather what may come.\nAccording to MarketWatch data, Apple is up 14.33% this year (from January through the first part of September). It\u2019s also up 6.26% over the past three months. If you\u2019d invested $10,000 two decades ago, you\u2019d have nearly $5 million today (assuming you\u2019d reinvested any dividends over that period).\nCheck Out: Best Stocks Under $5 To Buy This Month\nInvesting in Apple has been a game changer for many, but it\u2019s not the only tech company to consider.\n\u201cAs for other tech companies, I believe Microsoft and Nvidia are worth watching this year,\u201d Corona said. \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s dominance in cloud computing and AI gives it a strong growth trajectory, while Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI hardware and gaming makes it a compelling investment, especially as AI continues to expand.\u201d\nWhile there are never any guarantees, here\u2019s a bit more about these two companies.\nEven if you don\u2019t know much about the stock market or tech, you\u2019ve probably heard the name Nvidia once or twice. Nvidia\u2019s revenue for fiscal 2024 was about $61 billion, a 126% increase from the previous fiscal year.\nNvidia stock has seen some radical growth in the past five years too. Since 2019, it\u2019s risen by over 2,000%. If you\u2019d purchased just $100 worth of Nvidia stock five years ago, it\u2019d be worth more than $2,000 today. If you\u2019ve invested $1,000, it\u2019d be worth more than $20,000.\nThere are quite a few reasons Nvidia\u2019s grown so rapidly. Among them is, as Corona said, its advancements in AI hardware and gaming. It\u2019s also a leader when it comes to the graphic processing units (GPUs) found in data centers, personal computers and the like.\nEven if Nvidia doesn\u2019t see the same kind of growth in the coming half a decade or so, chances are it could continue to rise \u2014 though only time will truly tell.\nSimilarly, Microsoft is another company to watch this year and beyond. In July of this year, Microsoft stock reached an all-time high closing price of $466.73. Half a decade ago in July, it was trading around $132. Despite Microsoft having a few dips, as stocks often do, that\u2019s some significant growth.\nIn the past 10 years, Microsoft has risen by nearly 800%. As Corona said, part of what\u2019s contributed to Microsoft\u2019s success over the years is its leadership in cloud computing and AI. While the future remains to be seen, Microsoft\u2019s long-term resilience and ability to shift and meet market demands could be a good sign for investors going forward.\nWhether you choose to invest in tech or something else, your investment journey is going to be uniquely your own. That said, here are a few tips when choosing a company to invest in for your future.\nDo your research to make sure you truly understand the company you\u2019re investing in, what products and services it offers, and the industry as a whole.\nLook over its financial statements and performance over the years to determine its growth potential and overall financial health.\nEvaluate the company\u2019s net income growth and revenue over the years, as well as that of its competitors, and make sure it\u2019s poised for continued growth.\nResearch industry trends and anything else that might impact the company\u2019s performance and your potential returns.\nUse valuation metrics \u2014 like the current price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio \u2014 to determine whether or not the company\u2019s valuation is reasonably priced.\nIf you\u2019re not sure what companies to invest in, you can also speak with a professional to guide you along the way.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Moves For Building Lasting Wealth: What Smart Americans Are Doing Right\n3 Best Florida Cities To Buy Property in the Next 5 Years, According To Real Estate Agents\nThe Average Consumer Has $6,329 in Credit Card Debt.

        "Text": "Yesterday (9 September) Apple announced the iPhone 16, integrated with AI at its core, at the company's 'It's Glowtime' product launch event live streamed from California.\nThe new iPhone model promises improvements to its Siri personal assistant with a new software roll out coming next month.\nAnisha Bhatia, senior technology analyst at research and analysis company GlobalData said: \u201cMinor improvements on the iPhone 16 aside, it was Apple Intelligence that stole the show at the event in Cupertino, marking a milestone for the tech giant.\n\u201cThe new phone series is Apple\u2019s first to be engineered from inception to fully integrate on-device artificial intelligence capabilities and includes its latest A18 series of chipsets.\u201d\nHowever, despite this, \u201cGoogle will race ahead taking its Gemini AI models to 200 million Android devices by the end of 2024.\u201d\nAs one of the last major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to integrate AI into its devices, Apple Intelligence will focus on language, image, and action generation, drawing on personal context and will be supported by various on-device generative models.\nThe aim is that the AI will adapt and learn from user behaviour on each device to offer a tailored experience, with a full integration taking several years.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said at the product launch: \u201cThe next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up. It marks the beginning of an exciting new era.\u201d\nGoogle has recently increased its hardware focus with new stores opening in Boston, Chicago, and Santa Monica trailing disappointing results in previous hardware sales.\nBhatia concludes: \u201cThe upcoming iPhone cycle is crucial for Apple after multiple years of lackluster sales, especially in China, regulatory scrutiny, and a loss in market cap to Microsoft and Nvidia on the strength of their AI business.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nWall Street analysts are urging investors to take advantage of the recent pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Despite the AI giant\u2019s quarterly forecast falling short of the lofty expectations set by investors, who have driven a massive rally in its stock on hopes for generative AI, analysts remain bullish.\nNvidia's shares dropped more than 6% on Thursday after the fiscal Q2 report was released. While the company reported significant growth and profit, the results were viewed as mixed, as revenue and gross margin projections didn\u2019t surpass Wall Street's lofty targets as they had in previous quarters.\nUBS analysts, however, believe investors should \u201cbuy the pullback,\u201d noting that key indicators for Nvidia remain bullish. The bank specifically pointed to the surge in Nvidia\u2019s purchase commitments and supply obligations, describing this as \u201cthe most important metric we watch and a harbinger of future growth.\u201d\nUBS analysts also expressed confidence in Nvidia's margins, stating they are not concerned about gross margins and expect data center margins to stay consistent through the Blackwell cycle, mirroring the stability seen during the Hopper cycle.\nSimilarly, Bank of America analysts reiterated their Buy rating on Nvidia stock following the report and raised the target price from $150 to $165.\nBofA acknowledged that the stock is \u201clikely to be volatile\u201d in the near term due to Nvidia\u2019s projections missing elevated expectations, and noted that rising Blackwell ramp costs could impact Q3 margins.\nNonetheless, BofA remains confident in Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects, stressing that they \u201ccontinue to believe in NVDA\u2019s unique growth opportunity, execution and dominant 80%+ share as generative AI deployments are still in their first 1-1.5 years of what is at least a 3-4 year upfront investment cycle.\u201d\n\u201cAI deployment remains a mission-critical imperative for global cloud and enterprise customers, with NVDA providing the best turnkey model.\u201d\nCiti analysts have elevated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to their \u201ctop AI pick\u201d for 2025, surpassing both Nvidia and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). This move comes as Apple gears up to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup at the \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d product event on September 9th.\nAt the event, Apple is expected to introduce several key updates, including A18 chips utilizing the N3E process with an enhanced neural engine, improved camera and microphone features, and an upgraded modem for the Pro models.\n\u201cApple\u2019s September event is generally all about hardware updates, but we believe the company will put a lot of focus on how the hardware updates for the iPhone 16 family can better support its Apple Intelligence features that are expected to roll out officially later in the fall,\u201d Citi analysts remarked.\nLooking ahead, Citi expects a major refresh with the iPhone 17 next year, with AI features gradually being introduced over the coming year. This phased rollout is expected to give developers time to create apps and allow Apple to build customer recognition.\nCiti projects iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 unit sales to reach 85 million and 92 million in calendar years 2024 and 2025, respectively. Total iPhone units are expected to hit 228 million in 2024 and 241 million in 2025.\nThe analysts also highlighted that \u201cAAPL stock on average outperformed the broader market since 2016 by 5%-6% over the period from June-quarter earnings date into the September iPhone release date.\u201d\nInvestors should be more concerned about the potential bursting of the AI bubble than a looming U.S. or global recession, according to strategists at BCA Research. The firm\u2019s analysis suggests that the risks associated with the rapidly growing AI sector are more serious than those posed by broader economic downturns.\n\"When bubbles burst, the investment priority is to steer well clear of the bursting bubble plus sectors, regions, and countries heavily exposed to it.\" This implies that regardless of whether a recession follows the collapse of the bubble, the primary focus should be on avoiding the areas most impacted by the fallout.\nIn line with this, BCA Research advises investors to underweight U.S. tech and quasi-tech sectors, which are closely tied to the AI boom, and to reduce their exposure to U.S. equities within a global portfolio.\n\"Investors should worry much less about a U.S. or global recession than they should worry about the bubble in anything AI-related,\u201d BCA noted.\nWith the AI sector continuing to attract significant attention and capital, BCA warns that the potential for a sharp correction poses a noteworthy threat.\nWilliam Blair has initiated research coverage of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with an Outperform (Buy) rating, primarily driven by the underappreciated potential of Tesla's energy storage business.\nThe firm believes that Tesla Energy, particularly its Megapack and Powerwall products, could emerge as a significant growth driver, especially as expectations for the electric vehicle (EV) segment moderate in the near term.\n\u201cWe view Tesla Energy as the most underappreciated component of the Tesla story and expect the narrative will shift toward the energy storage business in light of tempered EV expectations in the near term.\"\nThe analysts highlight three key factors that make Tesla's energy storage business a compelling investment: the need for grid stabilization, the expansion of data centers, and the integration of renewable energy sources.\nThese aspects, alongside Tesla's broader automotive business and emerging opportunities in AI, robotaxis, and robotics, position the company as a technology leader with what William Blair describes as an \"Apple-esque ecosystem for the future of energy.\"\n\"Energy is the foundation for life, an abundance or lack of which determines how far society can reach on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\"\nTesla's approach to energy, through its more efficient EVs, energy storage solutions, and innovations like robotaxis and humanoid robots, aims to revolutionize how energy is created, stored, and utilized, with broad societal implications.\nWhile Tesla's current valuation may appear high by traditional metrics, William Blair argues that this premium is justified.\n\"Using traditional comparable analysis with auto or even tech, we understand the difficulty justifying the valuation, but in our opinion, this misunderstands the Tesla story.\"\nThey believe that the halo effect created by Elon Musk, the company\u2019s culture of first principles, and its technological advantages warrant the valuation premium.\nCiti analysts maintained their Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock with a $91 price target, based on an 18% higher-than-consensus CY25 earnings per share (EPS) following the July-quarter results.\nThe investment bank sees Marvell capitalizing on strong AI investments to rapidly expand its AI ASIC business, with four AI ASIC projects in the pipeline\u2014two currently ramping up, one expected in 2025, and another in 2026.\nMoreover, Citi is adding a Positive Catalyst Watch ahead of next week's Technology Conference, where Marvell's CEO Matt Murphy will participate in a fireside chat.\n\"We expect management to sound bullish on AI growth exceeding prior 2024/25 AI sales targets and all non-AI end markets to recover in 2H24,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\"MRVL stock typically outperforms when all its end markets move in the same direction,\u201d they added.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: \u2018Buy Nvidia pullback,\u2019 Apple named Top AI Pick\nMorgan Stanley updated its Dividend Equity Portfolio, dropped this big tech name\nWhat are implications of potential PlayStation 5 Pro launch on Sony's financials\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 40% ownership\n Recent sales by insiders \nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nLast week\u2019s 5.5% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 30%.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Apple.\n View our latest analysis for Apple \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Apple. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Apple's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Apple. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. With 6.9% and 3.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\nOur information suggests that Apple Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. \nWith a 37% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Apple. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Apple .\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "Text": "A European Union court has upheld a \u20ac13bn ($14.4bn) tax bill for Apple and a \u20ac2.4bn fine against Google for market abuse.\nThis decision aligns with the EU's continued crackdown on Big Tech's competitive practices and tax arrangements.\nIn case of Apple, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg upheld the European Commission's 2016 finding that Ireland gave Apple illegal state aid, granting the company an unfair tax advantage.\nThe Commission's investigation revealed that two Irish tax rulings had allowed Apple to lower its tax burden since 1991, which it deemed a misapplication of Irish tax laws.\nConsequently, Ireland was directed to recover up to \u20ac13bn from Apple.\nIn 2011, one of Apple's Irish subsidiaries reported profits of around \u20ac16bn, but due to tax rulings, only about \u20ac50m were subject to tax in Ireland.\nThis resulted in the subsidiary paying less than \u20ac10m in taxes, translating to an effective tax rate of roughly 0.05% on its annual profits.\nAn Apple spokesperson, as reported by Bloomberg, said: \u201cWe are disappointed with today\u2019s decision as previously the general court reviewed the facts and categorically annulled this case.\u201d\nIn a statement, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said: \u201cThe Commission will continue its work on harmful tax competition and aggressive tax planning. Both in terms of legislative proposals and enforcement. We will implement what we have decided.\u201d\nSimultaneously, the same court upheld a separate ruling that Google had abused its search engine's dominant position by favouring its own product listings, known as \u201cGoogle Shopping,\u201d over those of its competitors.\nThis decision confirms the Commission's stance on Google's anti-competitive practices.\n\u201cWe are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,\u201d a Google representative was quoted by AP as saying.\nFor Google, Vestager said: \u201cThe Google Shopping case set a precedent and paved the way for further regulatory actions, including the Digital Markets Act (DMA) of the European Union. In essence, the Google Shopping case was a catalyst for change, inspiring a more vigilant and proactive approach to regulating big tech and ensuring a fairer digital marketplace.\u201d\n\"Apple and Google lose EU court battles over combined $17bn\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

And the company\u2019s funding raise could reach $1 billion before the end of the year.\nThe project was confirmed in a feature about Ive that appears in The New York Times but did not give details about what, exactly, the project is. Industrial designer Marc Newson, who is working with Ive on the project, indicated the teams are still determining exactly what the project will be.\nThat\u2019s not stopping investors from jumping in. The project could reach unicorn status before the end of December, with investors including Emerson Collective, which is run by Laurene Powell Jobs. Ive\u2019s LoveDesign will be in charge of designing the product.\nIve and Altman first met last year, when Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, arranged a dinner between the two. Ive and Altman discussed how generative AI could make new computing devices possible, among other things. That led to more dinners and eventually an agreement to work together. In February, the startup found offices and hired 10 employees, including the person who succeeded Ive at Apple as well as the product development lead for the iPhone.\nIve left Apple in 2019 to start his own company.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Trimmed His Apple Stake. Here's What He Bought Instead.",
        "Author": "  Brett Schafer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It finally happened. This year, Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) (NYSE: BRK.A) began selling significant portions of its monster Apple stake. According to its latest 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple investment by approximately half in the second quarter. That stock was worth around $80 billion based on Apple's current share price.\nBerkshire Hathaway now has an estimated $300 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, a number that has been growing every quarter for quite a while now.\nA lot of the proceeds of that Apple stock sale are now sitting in cash and U.S. Treasuries as Buffett waits for the next big opportunity that appeals to him. However, the conglomerate did make a few stock buys in the second quarter. Here are two interesting stocks Berkshire Hathaway bought this summer that you should consider for your portfolio.\nOne of Buffett's favorite companies -- and a stock he seems to buy more of every quarter at this point -- is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). It is one of the largest U.S. oil and natural gas companies, and last quarter, it posted its highest production in four years (as measured in barrels of oil equivalent per day) from its various operations.\nThis led to $1.3 billion in free-cash-flow generation in the quarter. To further reinvest for growth, the company just bought CrownRock for $12 billion, a deal that added new acreage for production in the Midland basin. The new assets will help boost free-cash-flow generation and should help Occidental Petroleum consolidate its position in the United States.\nBuffett now owns an estimated 27% of Occidental Petroleum's stock, which is a big bet on continued U.S. demand for natural gas. This might prove a particularly prescient move as additional electricity demand growth builds from the artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing markets. However, right now, natural gas prices are falling. While that will be an issue for Occidental Petroleum in the short run (and helps explain why the stock is down 21% from its 52-week high), this could provide a buying opportunity for investors who are focused on the long term.\nOccidental Petroleum currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 13.4, even with natural gas prices low. If you are like Buffett and a believer in the durability of natural gas demand, now could be a great time to add Occidental Petroleum shares to your portfolio.\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) is a new position for Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway added the stock to its portfolio in the second quarter after shares fell by more than 40% from their recent high.\nUlta Beauty is struggling as it comes off of a beauty-supplies boom related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparable sales declined by 1.2% in the second quarter compared to growth of 8% in the prior-year period. Customers are spending less on beauty products and visiting Ulta stores less frequently. And given that the chain has close to 1,500 stores in operation, investors are likely worried that it's reaching market saturation.\nTaking a longer view, it is clear that Ulta Beauty has been adept at growing its earnings. Operating income is up 295% in the last 10 years while shares outstanding are down 26.8%. The company consistently repurchases stock to reduce its outstanding shares, which is good news for the remaining shareholders.\nBuffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway likely think that Ulta Beauty is a quality retailer that is facing short-term trouble. It currently trades at a low P/E ratio of 14.4 and is buying back a ton of stock.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there\u2019s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he\u2019s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it\u2019s worth paying attention to what\u2019s going right.\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I\u2019m willing to declare that there\u2019s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I\u2019m not trying to call a bottom, let\u2019s make that crystal clear, but I think it\u2019s worth taking a hard look at what\u2019s actually going right\u2014not just what\u2019s going wrong.\"\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it\u2019s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn\u2019t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\"Sure, the market\u2019s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren\u2019t even oversold yet\u2014at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there\u2019s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don\u2019t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let\u2019s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That\u2019s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won\u2019t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it\u2019s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\"But let\u2019s be realistic: You can\u2019t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there\u2019s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates when business is booming. That\u2019s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday\u2019s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\"\nOur Methodology\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to release a new phone, which Cramer believes will be impressive. However, he questioned whether the Justice Department might argue that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new success could give it too much bargaining power over app developers.\n\"On September 3rd, 2020, Apple lost $180 billion in market cap, but it soared 83% versus the S&P's 60% gain.\nIn Q3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) achieved record revenues of $85.78 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year, driven by a strong 14% rise in services revenue, which hit an all-time high of $24.21 billion. This growth highlights the success of key services like iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store, showcasing Apple's resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s net income also grew nearly 8% year-over-year to $21.45 billion, with earnings per share reaching $1.40, surpassing analysts' expectations. Despite a slight decline in iPhone sales, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s wearables, home, and accessories segment continued to perform well, contributing $8.4 billion in revenue. Additionally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s gross margin improved to 44.5%, reflecting effective cost management and operational efficiency.\nRecent innovations, including the iPhone 15 with new features and the upcoming Vision Pro AR/VR headset, demonstrate Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s ongoing commitment to technological advancement\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "Author": "  Umar Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks to Buy.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other consumer electronic stocks.\nThe global consumer electronics market has been experiencing significant growth, driven by rapid technological advancements and evolving consumer lifestyles. In 2024, the market reached an impressive valuation of $755 billion, with projections indicating it could soar to $1.15 trillion by 2031 (as per estimates by Research and Markets). This upward trajectory can largely be attributed to the increasing demand for innovative electronic devices that simplify everyday life and enhance overall convenience. As technology continues to evolve, so too does the consumer electronics industry, which has become an integral part of modern life. Consumer electronics have revolutionized how people live, work, and connect. From smartphones and tablets to smartwatches and connected home devices, these products have become essential to daily routines. They make everyday tasks easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable. Whether it\u2019s remote working, entertainment, or staying connected with loved ones, consumer electronics play a pivotal role in these activities. The steady stream of technological innovation has been a driving force behind the industry\u2019s continued growth, as consumers seek out new devices that integrate seamlessly into their lives.\nConsumer electronics devices, which are designed for communication, entertainment, and information purposes, play a crucial role in the tech landscape. Continuous innovation and the release of new, interconnected devices ensure the industry's competitiveness, with companies constantly striving to capture consumer interest. Despite global economic challenges, the consumer electronics\u00a0 market remains resilient, driven by advancements in areas like AI and smart devices. Wearables, such as smartwatches, alongside newer technologies like AR glasses and VR headsets, are gaining popularity. For example, smartphone shipments reached around 1.2 billion units globally in 2023, cementing the category\u2019s status as the most profitable segment. The market is projected to grow further in the coming years. According to industry reports, revenue could reach $1.13 trillion by 2025, recording a steady annual growth rate of 3%. Additionally, sustainability and recycling trends have become increasingly important, with companies benefiting from recycling materials to address challenges like the global chip shortage. The global electronics recycling market is expected to exceed $57 billion by 2025, further underscoring the industry's forward-thinking approach to innovation and sustainability.\nThe business environment is rapidly evolving, and by 2035, what is considered business-as-usual today will likely be vastly different. Stricter regulations and heightened market expectations are expected to result in increased costs related to raw material extraction, logistics, CO2 emissions pricing, and end-of-life expenses. According to a PWC report, the electronics industry could face a 15% increase in operational costs by 2035, compared to a 2023 baseline. This is due to rising landfill fees, longer transportation distances, fluctuating raw material prices, and the depletion of critical resources like copper, cobalt, lithium, and gold. To mitigate these rising costs, businesses can adopt circular business models that lead to lower operational expenses through CO2 savings and efficiency gains. Proactively transitioning to circular models offers a significant cost advantage over passively complying with regulations and sticking to traditional linear models. PWC\u2019s projections reveal that circular business models could lead to cost savings of around 12% and CO2 reductions of at least 10% by 2035 compared to a business-as-usual approach.\nNorth America, particularly the United States, is at the forefront of the consumer electronics market, leading globally in terms of adoption and demand. The region is expected to maintain this leadership position due to its swift embrace of cutting-edge technologies. In the U.S., the fast-paced lifestyle increasingly revolves around digital solutions, with automation becoming a key priority. The American market continues to thrive on its demand for new and innovative devices that can streamline everyday tasks and improve productivity. With the integration of advanced technologies and ongoing innovation, North America remains a critical region for the growth of the consumer electronics industry. At the same time, the rise of smart home technologies has opened up new opportunities for growth in the consumer electronics market. Devices like voice assistants and internet-connected home appliances are becoming increasingly popular, driving demand for products that make everyday life more convenient. The integration of consumer electronics with these technologies is shaping the future of home automation. Companies with advanced voice recognition technology are playing a significant role in the smart home revolution. Collaborative partnerships between firms and AI specialists are further enhancing the potential of these technologies, pointing to a future where smart homes become the norm.\nChina has also emerged as a major force in the global consumer electronics market, contributing significantly to the supply chain. As a leading producer of electronic components and raw materials, China plays a crucial role in meeting the global demand for consumer electronics. The Chinese market is witnessing a surge in the adoption of devices with voice assistance, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, making lives more convenient. The country\u2019s commitment to technological innovation and the growing preference for smart devices are fueling its market growth. With these advancements, China's consumer electronics market is projected to continue expanding at an impressive rate over the next decade. In Europe, Germany and the United Kingdom stand out as key markets with immense potential. These countries have seen high adoption rates of consumer electronics such as smartphones, televisions, personal computers, and cameras. European companies are heavily investing in research and development, and many are forming collaborations aimed at driving innovation in the industry. This focus on innovation and the growing demand for high-quality consumer electronics make Europe an exciting region for market growth.\nAs the global consumer electronics industry continues to expand, it presents compelling opportunities for investors. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the 10 best consumer electronics stocks to buy, offering valuable insights into the companies leading the way in this dynamic and fast-evolving sector.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we screened for consumer electronics companies using the Finviz stock screener and sifted through online rankings. We compiled a preliminary list of 15 stocks and then scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds and to pick the 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors as of the end of the second quarter of 2024. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nLeading the list of our ten best consumer electronics stocks to buy is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has once again demonstrated its resilience and market leadership by exceeding earnings expectations in Q3 2024. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.40, surpassing the anticipated $1.35. Apple's robust performance was underpinned by its June quarter revenue, which hit a record high of $85.8 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to maintain strong market momentum despite global economic challenges.\nA key driver of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) success is its diverse revenue streams, particularly in its services division. Services revenue set a new all-time record at $24.2 billion, marking a 14% year-over-year growth. This division, which includes Apple TV+, cloud services, and payment solutions, continues to gain traction, with over 1 billion paid subscriptions globally. The strong performance in services, with a gross margin of 74%, has significantly contributed to the company's overall profitability.\nIn terms of products, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone revenue reached $39.3 billion, showing resilience despite a slight year-over-year decline. The installed base of iPhones hit a new all-time high, and the company is poised to benefit further from the upcoming iPhone 15 lineup and iOS 18. Mac revenue also grew by 2% to $7 billion, driven by strong demand for the M3-powered MacBook Air, particularly in emerging markets. The iPad segment witnessed remarkable growth, with revenue surging 24% year-over-year, reflecting the successful launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air models.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ability to innovate remains a cornerstone of its success. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) through Apple Intelligence and the launch of the Vision Pro have sparked excitement among both consumers and enterprises. These developments not only showcase Apple's technological prowess but also position the company for continued growth in emerging markets and new industries, such as spatial computing. With strong fundamentals, a diversified product and service portfolio, and a commitment to innovation, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a top pick in the consumer electronics sector for long-term investors. The company's strong financial position, with $153 billion in cash and a disciplined capital return program, further solidifies its bullish outlook.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best consumer electronics stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "How Apple Intelligence is changing the way you use Siri on your iPhone",
        "Author": "  Aisha Malik ",
        "Text": "Following years of talk around Apple\u2019s lack of innovation when it comes to Siri, Apple has promised the launch of a smarter version of its digital assistant coming this fall. Siri is getting a slew of new features and updates thanks to the addition of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s generative AI offering, and a partnership with OpenAI.\nFrom ChatGPT integration to the ability to type instead of speak to Siri, there's a lot of ways Siri will change in the coming months. Here's a look at what the introduction of Apple Intelligence will allow you to do with the revamped digital assistant.\nWe'll learn more about Apple's plans for Siri at its iPhone event that starts at 10 a.m. Monday. We also expect to see new AirPods, a new Apple Watch and perhaps even new Macs.\nSiri will soon be able to tap into OpenAI's ChatGPT to answer certain questions. For example, if you need recipe ideas to make a meal using some ingredients from your garden, you can ask Siri, and Siri will automatically feed that info to ChatGPT to generate some options for you.\nYou can include photos with the questions you ask ChatGPT via Siri, or ask questions related to documents or PDFs. For example, say you come across a flower you like while on a walk but don't know what it's called. You can take a picture of it and ask Siri what it's called and where to find it.\nYou won't need a ChatGPT account, but you will need to grant permission for Siri to tap into the service.\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri will become aware of your personal context, which means it can take actions that are unique to you. Siri will be able to use the information available on your device to find what you\u2019re looking for.\nFor instance, if you can\u2019t remember whether your friend Alice shared a recipe with you in a text or an email, you can ask Siri to \u201cpull up the recipe that Alice sent a few days ago.\u201d Or, if you quickly need to find your passport number when booking a flight, you can ask Siri to pull it from your email or your images to automatically enter it into a required field.\nApple is making it easier for people to communicate with Siri: The assistant is now equipped to better understand natural language. Even if you stumble on your words when talking to Siri, the assistant will still be able to understand you. You can say, for instance, \u201cSiri, set an alarm for, oh wait no, set a timer for 10 minutes. Actually, make that five.\u201d Siri will understand what you\u2019re asking.\nPlus, you can ask Siri follow-up questions without having to repeat context. For example, if you ask Siri where your next family reunion is going to take place, it will respond with a location. You can then follow-up by asking, \u201cWhat will the weather be like there?\u201d without having to mention the name of the location.\nUp until now, you could only communicate with Siri via your voice. With Apple Intelligence, you can type to Siri when you don\u2019t want to speak out loud. You just need to double tap the button on your iPhone or iPad screen to ask Siri any question.\nThe option to type to Siri is handy when you\u2019re in a quiet environment and can\u2019t speak out loud. Or, perhaps you're in a loud environment; typing to Siri can ensure your inquiry is understood clearly.\nSiri now has more information about Apple\u2019s products and services, so if you have a question about your Apple device, you can ask Siri for help. That includes how to use a feature for the first time on your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nFor instance, you can ask Siri how to schedule a text message to send later. Siri will then give you step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Otherwise you'd have to to go into your settings and navigate to a help page if you needed more information about your device.\nSiri can now understand what\u2019s on your screen and take action based on what you\u2019re currently looking at on your device. For instance, if your friend texts you a new address, you can tell Siri to add the address to their contact card.\nOr, if your friend suggests a TV show on Apple TV+, you can ask Siri to open it.\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri can take action in and across apps. You can ask Siri to enhance a photo for you in the Photos app and then ask the digital assistant to send it to a specific person in Messages. You don't have to open the separate apps or complete the tasks, as Siri will be able to take action in both apps on its own.\nhttps://youtu.be/uarNiSl_uh4This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/how-apple-intelligence-is-changing-the-way-you-use-siri-on-your-iphone/\n"

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently published Jim Cramer\u2019s Exclusive List: 10 Stocks to Monitor Closely. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely.\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the risks of straying too far from technology stocks, particularly the dominant tech companies, in today\u2019s market. He pointed out how JP Morgan, despite being one of the best-performing banks, caused a stir by cutting its forecast, warning that estimates might be overly optimistic. This news hurt the broader market, dropping it by 93 points, although the S&P 500 saw a slight rise of 0.54%, and the tech-driven NASDAQ gained 0.84%.\n\u201cIn this market, every time you stray too far from technology, especially the tech titans, you ultimately get slapped in the face by reality. That\u2019s what happened today when the largest, and arguably best-performing, bank in the world, laid a huge egg with its forecast. They told us the estimates are too high, maybe way too high. That spoiled a big chunk of the market, ultimately dipping 93 points. The S&P inched up 0.54%, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ still gained 0.84%.\u201d\nCramer explained that since the Federal Reserve gave positive signals, investors had shifted away from tech into other areas of the market. This shift was part of the \u201cbroadening out\u201d that many investors had been waiting for, as it was believed to signal a healthier market. Financial stocks, which make up around 13.3% of the S&P 500, had been a source of excitement for those tired of relying on the leading tech stocks.\n\u201cFor the past couple of months, ever since the Fed gave us the all-clear signal, we\u2019ve seen money flow out of tech into long-neglected regions of the stock market. This is the fabled \u201cbroadening out\u201d that people spent all year clamoring for. When we bring in more groups of winners, we\u2019re supposed to have a much healthier market, at least that\u2019s what they say. There are tons of financials in the S&P 500, about 13.3% of the index and the strength in those stocks was a source of much joy for everyone who had gotten sick of The Magnificent Seven.\u201d\nHowever, as Cramer noted, economic uncertainty and disappointing forecasts from bank companies disrupted this broader market strength. Daniel Pinto, the bank company\u2019s COO, dashed hopes by signaling that the outlook for the bank wasn\u2019t as strong as expected. The key issue was that net interest income, a critical measure for banks, was projected to miss expectations due to reduced capital market activity. For Cramer, this underperformance highlighted the danger of moving away from tech stocks too soon.\n\u201cBut a funny thing happened on the way to that broadened-out market: we got economic choppiness. Or to use a more accurate phrase, we got guide-downs that were intolerable to any of the leaders, and the kiss of death to the stock of the bank. You can\u2019t be a leader when you\u2019re slashing your forecast for H2. That\u2019s when the shareholders kick you to the curb and find someone new to follow.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer believes that Wall Street is underestimating the significance of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 launch. He points out that previous iPhone models have also faced initial criticism, but have ultimately proven successful. Cramer emphasizes that the incremental improvements in the iPhone 16 contribute to increased usage of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s services, a growing revenue stream that will eventually surpass the iPhone. While customer reaction to the new phone is uncertain, Cramer believes that the improvements will be highly valued by millions of users, making Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a strong long-term investment.\n\u201cWall Street doesn\u2019t seem too excited about the launch of the Apple Inc. iPhone 16 yesterday, but let me tell you something about this product. Every iPhone has been criticized as a disappointment at launch, except for the first couple of models. Every iPhone supposedly offers only incremental improvements. Don\u2019t bother reading the reviews. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll tell you every single time\u2026\nThe positive outlook for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is based on its strong growth potential, despite some short-term challenges. Although iPhone 15 sales in China have been weak, analysts expect a significant upgrade cycle, with anticipation for over 270 million units, especially as the iPhone 16 nears its 2025 release. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s services segment, including the App Store, is thriving, with Q1 2024 revenue reaching a record $23.1 billion and showing strong double-digit growth.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also advancing in artificial intelligence, integrating AI into products like the iPhone 16 and the Vision Pro headset, which positions Apple as a leader in AI innovation. Despite some difficulties in hardware sales, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s resilient gross margins and strong profitability from its services support its financial stability.\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of exclusive stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure:\u00a0None.

        "Author": "  Juliana Liu and Joyce Jiang, CNN ",
        "Text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up for CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country\u2019s rise and how it impacts the world.\nHuawei has unveiled what it calls the world\u2019s first tri-fold smartphone, just hours after arch-rival Apple introduced the iPhone 16, in a carefully timed Tuesday launch that has generated significant buzz for the Chinese tech giant.\nThe Shenzhen-based firm, which has been a flashpoint in an escalating tech rivalry between Washington and Beijing, is currently in the midst of a spectacular comeback having launched wildly popular models like the Mate 60 Pro and Mate X5. In August, Huawei reported double digit jumps in both revenue and profit, despite US sanctions.\nSuccessful sales of the Mate XT smartphone, which currently has more than 3.7 million pre-orders since becoming available online Saturday, would be another indication of the company\u2019s sustained resurgence. The base model starts at 19,999 yuan ($2,800).\nRichard Yu, the chairman of Huawei\u2019s consumer business, said at the livestreamed launch event that the smartphone had taken five years to develop, leading to \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d in screen and hinge technology.\n\u201cHuawei Mate XT is the world\u2019s first triple-fold smartphone, and the largest and thinnest foldable handset globally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the first in the world to achieve outward folding (in smartphones) and the first to create an inward-folding phone with no gaps.\u201d\nThe phone features three panels that can be folded up to three times, Yu said. It has a 10.2-inch screen and is available in red and black.\nTuesday\u2019s product launch came just hours after competitor Apple (AAPL) unveiled a slew of new products, including the iPhone 16, its first smartphone purpose-built for generative artificial intelligence (AI). It\u2019s a feature the company hopes will help convince customers to upgrade.\nAmber Liu, research manager at market research firm Canalys, said Huawei\u2019s rapid recovery \u201cdirectly challenges\u201d Apple\u2019s performance in China, its second-largest market which accounts for over 20% of its global shipments.\nIt also comes after Chinese smartphone makers dominated the top five spots domestically on a quarterly basis for the first time ever, she said, pushing Apple to sixth place.\n\u201cThe close timing of Huawei and Apple\u2019s product launches signals the start of a new competitive wave in the Chinese premium market,\u201d Liu told CNN. Key areas of competition will include high-end products, software capabilities and AI deployment, she added.\nApple said that generative AI, like ChatGPT, on its iPhone 16 would allow users to create text and images with natural-language prompts. It\u2019s unclear whether the Mate XT includes any AI features.\nJene Park, a senior analyst at the smartphone foldables practice at Counterpoint Research, said the company is clearly focusing on a larger display and extended battery usage time.\n\u201cI think this latest attempt could bring about significant changes in the display size of book-type foldables, which currently range from 7 inches to 8 inches,\u201d he added.\nAnalysts say the success of the launch will depend, in part, on the phone\u2019s pricing and availability. Liu believes actual sales will be lower than the number of pre-orders for those reasons.\nSales of Huawei\u2019s flagship smartphones rose 72% in the first five months of 2024, compared to the same period a year ago, Yu said in June, underscoring the company\u2019s ambitions to claw its way back to the top despite severe US restrictions.\nUS policymakers have long claimed that Huawei poses a national security risk, alleging that the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s equipment to spy. The company repeatedly denied those allegations, but that didn\u2019t stop some American allies \u2014 such as the UK \u2014 limiting Huawei\u2019s role in building 5G networks.\nThe US ban prevented companies like Google (GOOGL) from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS. Those restrictions dealt a huge blow to the Chinese firm\u2019s smartphone ambitions at the time, with some analysts predicting the Huawei phone would become \u201ca brick.\u201d\nNow, the company is once again making its way back to the top. It\u2019s also venturing into new businesses. Last year, it launched an electric sedan to take on Tesla\u2019s Model S. And it has big ambitions in AI.\nNvidia (NVDA) earlier this year named Huawei a top competitor in a number of areas, including in the production of processors that power AI systems.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Must-Watch Stocks Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other must-watch stocks according to Jim Cramer.\nJim Cramer recently discussed Nvidia\u2019s latest earnings report on Mad Money. Despite a solid quarter, the company did not exceed the high expectations set by investors and failed to deliver its key products quickly enough to sustain its previous extraordinary performance. This disappointment led to a relatively muted market reaction, with only modest movements in major indices.\n\"Turns out that the company is mortal after all. Even though it reported a great quarter last night, it wasn\u2019t able to deliver its key product fast enough to allow the company to do what it\u2019s done so many times before: blow away earnings and raise forecasts to unfathomable levels. The company didn\u2019t define today\u2019s trading because it failed to dazzle in the way that so many money managers had come to expect. The major indices didn\u2019t move much\u2014the Dow advanced 244 points, the S&P was basically flat, and the NASDAQ dipped just 0.23%.\"\nCramer expressed relief that the company\u2019s quarter brought an end to the unrealistic expectations that had surrounded the stock. He emphasized that the company is not a miracle company but a firm specializing in high-performance chips that enhance productivity and problem-solving. Cramer noted that the market had unfairly elevated the company to a status where it was expected to perform miraculous feats beyond its actual capabilities.\n\"My response to all this? Goodness gracious! With this quarter\u2019s results, the albatross of perfection is now gone; the millstone has been shredded. As much as I love the company, I\u2019m thrilled that we can finally return to a market where there are many important stocks representing many important trends, rather than just one stock capturing the attention of legions of investors\u2014many of whom have no idea what it does, let alone where it fits into the technological food chain.\nHe believes the company should be held as an investment, not traded based on fluctuating expectations. While acknowledging that the stock had become overvalued before the quarter, Cramer maintains his belief in the company\u2019s value.\n\"Right now, it looks like the company can expand customer gross margins\u2014important but not earth-shaking, especially since the enterprise is the client, not you; you won\u2019t even see it. Now that this quarter is in the rearview mirror, my hope is that those who wagered on the stock, rather than invested in the company, will finally move on. No more exacting comparisons with AMD, please. We need to go back to a world where we value the company like any other company, with a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple based on its growth.\"\nJim Cramer also addressed the question of whether AI investments are yielding tangible returns, especially in terms of improving gross margins. He noted that many of the most convincing AI applications have taken time to develop. Early investment in AI often focuses on training models, and only after this stage can AI start delivering practical benefits. Cramer emphasized that AI's most significant impacts are typically in enterprise settings rather than for individual consumers.\n\"For the skeptics, the most compelling AI use cases have been slow to develop. Much of the early investment goes toward training AI models. Only after this process comes to fruition can artificial intelligence actually do something useful for users. It's important to note that most areas where AI is truly useful are enterprise-oriented.\nTo highlight the progress in this area, Cramer is introducing a new feature: a running list of notable AI use cases. He pointed out that some AI applications have been in use for a while. For instance, OpenAI generates revenue from its ChatGPT offerings, with a free version available alongside paid subscriptions like ChatGPT Plus for $20 a month and more expensive options for businesses.\n\"Some of these have been around for a while. For example, there's a free version of ChatGPT, but OpenAI generates revenue from $20-a-month ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, as well as higher-priced offerings for enterprise customers. The same goes for Gemini and Claude, which have similar pricing. Microsoft's Copilot functionality and Adobe's Firefly tools have also been part of their broader product suite since late last year. Both are money makers.\"\nOur Methodology\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks with notable growth potential. It also examines hedge fund perspectives on these stocks, ranking them from least to most owned based on hedge fund ownership.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer recently discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is on the verge of launching a new phone featuring advanced artificial intelligence. Historically, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock has been expensive, but the company has now developed a steady stream of service revenue, providing more stable earnings.\n\"How about a company like Apple, which is about to issue a new phone offering the latest in artificial intelligence for consumers? The stock\u2019s historically pricey, but Apple didn\u2019t have a sticky and predictable service revenue stream until now, creating a whole new level of stable earnings. Plus, Apple will be using ChatGPT, which cost OpenAI and Microsoft billions to build, yet Apple gets it for free due to its huge, highly valued installed base.\"\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) offers a compelling investment opportunity despite recent challenges. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s Q3 2024 earnings report showed strong financial performance, with revenue reaching $81.8 billion, slightly above expectations but marking a minor year-over-year decline. Notably, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s services segment achieved a record $21.2 billion in revenue, underscoring the success of its shift towards a more services-oriented model.\nThe upcoming CFO transition, with Kevan Parekh set to replace Luca Maestri in January 2025, introduces some short-term uncertainty. However, the launch of the iPhone 16 with AI capabilities in September is expected to kickstart a new upgrade cycle and potentially push Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s valuation beyond $4 trillion.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Jim Cramer's must-watch stocks today. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

Apple expects the September quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues.\u00a0For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)Tesla\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (-11.7% vs. -10.8%). The company has been plagued by shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts.\u00a0Tesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market. With competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture.\u00a0The expected rollout of Tesla-supervised Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China and Europe by the end of the year will boost prospects. Additionally, TSLA\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)Shares of NextEra Energy have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+27.3% vs. +23.6%).

This microcap company with market capitalization of $422.46 million has demonstrated exceptional performance through consistent revenue and profit increases, with the first half of 2024 net income reaching $13.4 million, up from $8.8 million in the first half of 2023, driven by a 10% jump in net premiums and strong escrow and other service outputs.\u00a0Investors Title's resilience is further underscored by its robust balance sheet, with $26.7 million in cash and minimal liabilities, offering financial flexibility for potential growth initiatives like acquisitions. Technological advancements have propelled operational efficiencies, setting the stage for market share gains in a burgeoning global title insurance market.\u00a0The company's commitment to shareholder returns is evident from consistent dividends. However, it faces challenges from rising operating expenses, competitive pressures and volatile investment income, which could impact future earnings stability.(You can read the full research report on Investors Tile here >>>)Shares of Autoscope Technologies have outperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (+63.4% vs. +42.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $41.51 million is built on a stable revenue base, driven by recurring royalties, particularly from Autoscope Vision, which benefits from government-funded safety initiatives like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\u00a0Autoscope Technologies showcases strong profitability with a 33% year-over-year increase in net income in second-quarter 2024, supported by a high gross margin and reduced operating expenses. A solid balance sheet, strategic dividend policy and alignment with long-term traffic safety trends further strengthen its appeal.\u00a0However, heavy reliance on royalties, weak product sales margins, increasing tax expenses and dependence on a single customer pose risks. Emerging technologies and competitive pressures could challenge market share and profitability, adding volatility to the stock. As such, the AATC stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Autoscope Technologies here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HCA Healthcare, Inc.

        "Text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - An EU court order this week that Apple pay Ireland 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) presents the government with opportunities to address pressing infrastructure, housebuilding and capital project needs, Prime Minister Simon Harris said on Thursday.\nIreland had fought the European Union back-tax bill alongside Apple since 2016, seeking to defend its position as the location of choice for U.S. multinationals in Europe but accepted that it can now use the cash, which has since grown to 13.8 billion euros in an escrow fund.\nMinisters have pledged to decide in the coming weeks how to invest the funds - equivalent to around half of Ireland's annual corporate tax take - and Harris' comments suggested the funds would not simply be added to a new sovereign wealth fund.\n\"It cannot be spent on day-to-day (expenditure) because you only get this money once but there are options and opportunities as to what we can do with it... How we can address some of the pressing infrastructural challenges, capital challenges and housing challenges,\" Harris told national broadcaster RTE.\n\"I've said this consistently over the summer before the Apple judgment, when it comes to things like housing, water and energy, we've real constraints in this country and we need to invest.\"\n(This story has been refiled to change a picture)\n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by William James)\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data\u2014not too hot, not too cold\u2014that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on \u00a0\u201chistorical trends\u201d and the \u201cmarket landscape\u201d from various sectors which have \u201csubstantial\u201d potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered a strong third-quarter performance, despite weaker-than-expected sales in China. While the company's China sales declined by 6.5% year-over-year, the overall results exceeded Wall Street expectations. According to Toni Sacconaghi, the quarter was \"clean,\" with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) slightly surpassing estimates and providing modestly optimistic guidance for the upcoming quarter.\nDan Ives, Managing Director of Equity Research, Wedbush Securities maintains a bullish stance, describing the company\u2019s performance as \"good enough for now.\" With the iPhone 16 cycle yet to begin, Ives sees strong potential, especially as Apple\u2019s services sector remains robust and China begins to turn into a tailwind for the company. He rates Apple\u2019s position as highly favorable, predicting the stock will continue to perform well, particularly as the company enters what he terms an AI-driven super cycle with the upcoming iPhone 16.\nRecently, Ben, Head of Technology Research, provided insights into Apple\u2019s future. Despite Buffett\u2019s sales, he remains optimistic about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing a \"generational upgrade cycle\" as a key driver. Ben highlighted that Apple's user base is aging, creating significant potential for new upgrades, especially with the integration of Apple Intelligence, which is exclusive to newer models.\nConcerns exist about whether Apple Intelligence will substantially impact the upgrade cycle, particularly if its benefits are limited to higher-end phones. However, Ben projects that Apple's earnings could exceed $9 per share in a bull case scenario, potentially approaching $10. Historical data shows that iPhone growth can surpass 20%, and while current expectations are modest\u2014mid-single digits for iPhone sales this year and next\u2014Ben believes these are achievable. He anticipates a gradual but positive upgrade cycle peaking around 2026, which should be an improvement over recent stagnation.\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's 10 Best Stocks to Buy After Fed Rate Cut.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's best stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer observes that many on Wall Street enjoy going against the crowd, which is why some analysts downplay the significance of a half-point rate cut. He disagrees, asserting that common sense often gets overlooked by those who think they know better.\n\"Everybody on Wall Street loves to be a contrarian, which is why so many commentators keep trying to minimize the impact of a half-point rate cut. Not me! No matter what, common sense dictates that there are always people who think they know better than common sense, and they don\u2019t. There are so few advantages to age, I have to tell you.\"\nJim Cramer points out the irony that, despite critics spreading negativity, the stock market soared today, with the Dow jumping 522 points, the S&P rising 1.7%, and the NASDAQ climbing 2.5%. He found it remarkable. Initially, bearish sentiment swayed the markets right after the announcement yesterday, causing many to panic and sell, particularly in tech stocks, which often face unwarranted hits from rate cuts.\nCritics fueled this panic, echoing a negative narrative without questioning it, which led to a rush for the exits. Cramer emphasizes that this reaction to a rate cut, rather than a hike, creates a misleading panic, demonstrating how easily people can be misled into thinking a 50 basis point easing is bad news, which he believes is simply foolish.\n\"Funny thing: while these critics were polluting your minds, the stock market exploded today, with the Dow gaining 522 points, the S&P surging 1.7%, and the NASDAQ pole vaulting 2.5%. I\u2019ve got to tell you, it was a thing of beauty. The Bears initially had their way with the markets, distorting a view immediately after the announcement at 2 p.m. yesterday. They fooled enough people to start blowing out of stocks in their frenzy, especially tech stocks, as if those are the ones that always get hit on a rate cut.\nJim Cramer notes that during a period of rate cuts, the potential winners are diverse and promising, while the losers are clear and should be avoided. He highlights that once the Wall Street Journal announced the possibility of a 50 basis point cut, the range of stocks that could benefit significantly widened. A smaller 25 basis point cut would have helped homebuilders if they increased construction, but they\u2019ve been hesitant due to still-high rates. However, a 50 basis point cut will lead to lower mortgage rates, making homes more affordable and likely boosting the housing market.\n\"The winners in an easing cycle are varied and exciting, while the losers are obvious and must be avoided. From the moment the Journal reported that there could be a 50 basis point cut, the swatch of what can go higher expanded dogmatically. A 25-point cut would have been truly beneficial for homebuilders if they would just start building a lot more homes, that's something they've been reluctant to do because rates are still too high. But a 50 basis point cut means lower mortgages for certain and, therefore, more affordable homes.\"\nOur Methodology:\nIn this article, we review the latest episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money where he discussed several stocks. We have ranked the companies according to their popularity among hedge funds, starting with the least owned and progressing to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer remains a staunch advocate for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), suggesting that investors should hold the stock for the long term rather than engage in frequent trading. This recommendation is further solidified by recent comments from T-Mobile (\nNASDAQ:TMUS)'s CEO, who confirmed strong sales of the new iPhone model. Contrary to the bearish sentiment expressed by some analysts, the CEO indicated that sales have exceeded expectations, even surpassing those of the previous year.\n\"A Cramer favorite: Apple. I always say to own it, don\u2019t trade it, and I\u2019m even more adamant about that position after what we heard from T-Mobile's CEO yesterday. Contrary to what the bears have been telling you, he says sales of the new iPhone are going great.\"\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to demonstrate exceptional financial performance, with Q2 2024 revenue reaching approximately $94 billion. This significant year-over-year growth, driven by robust iPhone sales and the company's expanding services segment, solidifies Apple's position as a global technology leader.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s diverse ecosystem, which includes hardware, software, and services, continues to thrive. The services segment\u2014covering Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, iCloud, and the App Store\u2014shows consistent growth and significantly contributes to overall revenue. Upcoming product launches, such as the iPhone 15 and advancements in AR/VR technology, are expected to maintain consumer interest and boost future sales, reinforcing Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s commitment to innovation.\nAdditionally, strong brand loyalty fosters recurring revenue as customers tend to stick with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s products, enhancing customer lifetime value. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also expanding into emerging markets and increasing its focus on health technology, potentially creating new revenue streams.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Jim Cramer's best stocks to buy after Fed rate cut. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META) won the dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by concealing how changes to Apple's (AAPL) privacy settings would make Facebook and Instagram less desirable for advertisers.\nIn a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also rejected claims that Meta concealed former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's use of company resources on personal matters, including her wedding and her best-selling book \"Lean In.\"\nThe Oakland, California-based judge also turned aside claims that Meta knew its transition to Reels, which copied TikTok's short-form video format, would hurt revenue because it offered fewer ads per hour than older formats.\nShareholders led by four Israeli insurers and pension funds challenged 17 allegedly false and misleading statements that Meta made in 2021 and 2022.\nThey said Meta's stock price fell 53% in less than a year as the truth came out, wiping out well over $500 billion of the Menlo Park, California-based company's market value.\nBut in her 34-page decision, Rogers said Meta's eventual admission that Apple's iOS privacy changes could pose a $10 billion \"headwind\" in 2022 did not demonstrate that its earlier disclosures were false.\nShe also said the claims about Sandberg came \"entirely from press reports\" and were unproven, and found no proof that the transition to Reels hurt Meta's financial performance.\n\"The court determines plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged violations of federal securities law,\" Rogers wrote.\nShe dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again.\nOther defendants included Sandberg, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li and her predecessor David Wehner.\nLawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Meta had no immediate comment.\nThe case, which has a different named plaintiff, is Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v Meta Platforms Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01470.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.3%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $94.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $390.63 billion and $424.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +8.6%, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The ability of generative AI to handle complex tasks like legal document drafting and even medical diagnoses has led experts to view it as a game-changer across industries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nBig Tech CEOs are hyper-focused on AI development right now. Satya Nadella has famously remarked that AI is the defining technology of our time, emphasizing the role of generative AI tools that his company markets, such as Copilot and Azure OpenAI, in revolutionizing work processes and enhancing productivity. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai has stressed the importance of setting up responsible AI development, remarking that the potential of AI is immense, and noting that it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. Andy Jassy has claimed that with cloud cost optimization programs largely in the rearview, companies are now turning their attention to investments in generative AI that is already a multi-billion-dollar business.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a010 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI news that has not received significant media coverage but is important to the AI market nonetheless.

Latest reports suggest that the company is manufacturing Apple A16 chips, used in iPhones 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, as well as 15 and 15 Plus, at the new Arizona plant in small but significant numbers. A Bloomberg report suggests that the volume of production would ramp up considerably when the second stage of the Phase 1 fab at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) facility was completed and production was underway, which would put the Arizona project on track to hit its target for production in the first half of 2025.\nOverall TSM ranks 12th on our list of AI news you probably missed.

The EU has scrutinized big tech companies for various reasons, including child safety issues at Facebook parent Meta.\nThe court rulings were a test for the bloc's outgoing competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, who has suffered a series of setbacks in EU courts against her decisions.\nOne of the most bitter legal battles between the European Commission and big tech, the Apple case dates back to 2016 when the EU's executive arm claimed Ireland allowed the iPhone maker to avoid billions of euros in taxes.\nIt had been one of several investigations in the previous decade into sweetheart tax arrangements between major companies and several EU countries.\nThe iPhone maker gained the upper hand in the long-running Ireland case in 2020, when the EU's General Court annulled the order for Apple to pay the taxes owed\u2014a decision Brussels appealed.\nBut Apple was dealt a blow in November last year when the top legal adviser of the higher European Court of Justice recommended scrapping that decision, saying it was peppered with legal errors.\nThe European Court of Justice dismissed an appeal by Google and parent company Alphabet against the fine, levied in 2017 after Brussels found that Google abused its dominant position by favoring its own Google Shopping service in search results.\nGoogle lost its final appeal as the court upheld the \u20ac2.4 billion fine that a top adviser recommended in January.\nAlthough such advisory opinions are not binding, they do carry weight and are often followed by EU judges in their rulings.\nIt was not Google's only fine. The company was hit with record fines worth around \u20ac8 billion for violating EU competition rules between 2017 and 2019.\nGoogle faces yet another test next week when the top EU court will decide on the smallest of those fines, worth around \u20ac1.49 billion.\nThe legal headaches for Google are mounting across the Atlantic as well.\nA trial began on Monday in the United States where the government accuses Google of dominating online advertising and stifling competition.\nIt comes after a U.S. judge ruled last month that Google maintained a monopoly with its search engine.\nGoogle's so-called ad tech\u2014the system that decides which online adverts people see and how much they cost\u2014is an area of particular concern for regulators worldwide.\nBrussels, in a preliminary finding last year, accused Google of abusing its dominance of the online ad market and recommended that the U.S. company sell part of its ad services to ensure fair competition. Google had the right to respond, and the probe remains open.\nSeparately, Britain's competition watchdog on Friday concluded Google employs \"anti-competitive practices\" with regards to online advertising after a two-year investigation.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Apple faces a looming deadline to produce what it says are more than 1 million documents related to recent App Store changes.\nOn Friday, Judge Thomas S. Hixson denied the company\u2019s attempt to extend that deadline, describing the request as \u201cbad behavior.\" So Apple's deadline is still Monday, September 30: \u201cIt\u2019s up to Apple to figure out how to meet the deadline, but Monday is indeed the deadline.\u201d\nThis is just the latest chapter in the ongoing legal dispute between Apple and Fortnite-maker Epic Games, which has been fighting Apple\u2019s App Store rules. While Apple was largely successful in U.S. district court, the court did order the company to loosen its App Store rules, giving developers more freedom to collect payments and subscription fees without using Apple\u2019s in-app payment platform.\nThis prompted Apple to roll out App Store changes in January. However, with Apple still collecting a (smaller) commission on those payments, Epic is now challenging the company over what it calls \u201cbad-faith\u201d compliance.\nIn August, a judge directed Apple to produce all documents related to how it decided on the new App Store rules. But on Thursday, Apple said Epic\u2019s search terms surfaced more than twice as many documents as expected, so the company needed two more weeks to review what turned out to be \u201cnorth of 1.3 million documents.\u201d\nHixson \u2014 who's in charge of the document discovery process \u2014 not only denied Apple\u2019s request for an extension but also wrote that \u201cthe way Apple announced out of the blue four days before the substantial completion deadline that it would not make that deadline because of a document count that it had surely been aware of for weeks hardly creates the impression that Apple is behaving responsibly.\u201d\nHixson also suggested that\u00a0 Apple had plenty of time to collect and review the documents. Indeed, with its \u201cnearly infinite resources,\u201d he argued it \u201ccould probably review that many documents in a weekend.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/28/judge-is-unimpressed-by-apples-deadline-extension-request-in-epic-games-dispute/\n"

        "Author": "  RAF CASERT and KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 Apple on Tuesday lost its last bid to avoid paying 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, in a finale to a dispute with the European Union that centered on sweetheart deals that Dublin was offering to attract multinational businesses with minimal taxes across the 27-nation bloc. The final decision by the EU\u2019s top court was quickly hailed as a landmark victory over corporate greed.\n\u201cToday is a big win for European citizens and for tax justice,\u201d said European antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, whose 8-year fight to impose the measure on the global tech behemoth brought her to tears when she finally heard she had won.\nThe ruling \u201cconfirms the European Commission\u2019s 2016 decision: Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid which Ireland is required to recover,\" the European Court of Justice said in a press release summarizing its decision.\nThe case drew outrage from Apple when it was opened in 2016, with CEO Tim Cook calling it \u201ctotal political crap.\u201d Then-U.S. President Donald Trump slammed Vestager, who spearheaded the campaign to root out special tax deals and crack down on big U.S. tech companies, as the \u201ctax lady\u201d who \u201creally hates the U.S.\u201d\nVestager had accused Apple of striking an illegal tax deal with Irish authorities so that it could pay extremely low rates. The European Union\u2019s General Court disagreed with that in its 2020 ruling, which has now been overturned.\nIt did not leave Apple much happier on Tuesday. \"We are disappointed with today\u2019s decision as previously the General Court reviewed the facts and categorically annulled this case,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cThere has never been a special deal,\" the company said.\nVestager said she was stunned by the last-gasp legal turnaround. \u201cI had prepared for a stiff upper lip, facing a possible defeat. But, you know, it was a win that made me cry. Because it is very important to show European taxpayers that once in a while, tax justice can be done.\u201d\nEight years ago, the ruling that found Ireland had granted a sweetheart deal that let Apple pay almost no taxes across the European bloc for 11 years dramatically escalated the fight over whether America\u2019s biggest corporations are paying their fair share around the world.\nThe EU head office said that Ireland granted such lavish tax breaks to Apple that the company\u2019s effective corporate tax rate on its European profits dropped from 1% in 2003 to a mere 0.005% in 2014. Apple has disputed such figures.\nVestager said that through the deals with the Irish government the company paid next to nothing in taxes while instead \u201cApple should have paid taxes worth 13 billion euros on all related profits in Ireland.\u201d\n\u201cThis means that the recovered taxes, which have been in an escrow account for quite some years in Ireland during the ongoing court proceedings, now must be released to the Irish State,\u201d she said.\nThe government in Dublin said that \u201cthe Irish position has always been that Ireland does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers,\u201d before adding that \"Ireland will of course respect the findings of the Court regarding the tax due in this case.\"\nBoth Vestager and the Irish government noted that the country's corporate tax residence rules have since been changed so the provisions that allowed Dublin to offer Apple the deal no longer exist.\nThe ruling that has now been upheld was one of a number of aggressive moves by European officials to hold U.S. businesses, particularly big tech companies, accountable under the EU\u2019s rules on taxation and fair competition.\nThe commission has also previously targeted Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat with tax rulings, which were later overturned on appeal.\nThe latest decision means corporations should still be on watch, said Varg Folkman, a policy analyst with European Policy Centre, a think tank.\n\u201cThis was the big one,\" Folkman said. \"It was the largest fine. By a long while. So the commission winning this is really saying that this is something that can happen to them as well.\u201d\nWith one EU member offering unfair tax concessions to attract multinationals that others could not or would not match, it not only skewed multinational investments in the bloc but also gave global corporations massive sway to keep their taxes to a fraction of their revenue.\n\u201cMember states cannot continue the race to the bottom corporate tax policies that undermine European unity and social cohesion. Big tech companies like Apple should not be able to exploit their market power and avoid paying their fair share to society,\" said EU MEP Kira Peter-Hansen.\nAnd Tuesday's ruling showed that authorities still have a bite.\n\u201cIt shows taxpayers that there can be fairness,\" said Vestager. \"And it has shown big companies that they are also not above the law when it comes to taxation.\u201d\n___\nKelvin Chan contributed to this report from London.\n"

        "Author": "  David Kirton ",
        "Text": "By David Kirton\nSHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies on Tuesday unveiled a $2,800 tri-foldable phone as it seeks to extend its lead in the world's biggest smartphone market and steal the spotlight from Apple hours after it debuted a new iPhone.\nThe Chinese tech giant showed off its new Mate XT, which users can fold three ways like an accordion screen door, during a launch ceremony in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen.\nThe device has already received more than 4 million pre-orders, for which no deposit is required, according to the company's website. The entire global market for foldable phones was around 4 million units in the second quarter, according to research firm IDC.\n\"Today we bring you a product that everyone can think of but could not make. Our team has been working hard for five years and has never given up,\" Huawei executive director Richard Yu said at the launch.\n\"Today we will once again rewrite the history of the industry, turn science fiction into reality, and lead a new era of folding devices.\"\nThe new phone boasts an AI assistant with text summary, translation and editing functions, as well as AI-boosted image editing functions such as trimming unwanted parts of photos, Yu said.\nAI functions are supported by Huawei's in-house Kylin chips, he added.\nThe much-anticipated launch comes just hours after Apple unveiled its latest model - the AI-boosted iPhone 16 - with both smartphones due to go on sale on Sept. 20.\nThe Mate XT comes in red and black and has a 10.2 inch display screen. At 3.6mm wide, the company said it was the world's slimmest foldable phone and has a keyboard attachment that fits in your pocket.\nPrices start at 19,999 yuan ($2,800) for 256 gigabytes, with versions with higher memory available for 21,999 yuan and 23,999 yuan.\nAPPLE'S AI CHALLENGE\nThe launch, which follows a series of successful smartphone debuts, underscores Huawei's ability to navigate U.S. sanctions and solidifies its position against Apple in China, where some consumers criticised the new iPhone 16 for its lack of AI features in the country.\nApple has yet to announce an AI partner in China to power the 16s and Apple Intelligence, the company's AI software, will only be available in Chinese languages next year.\n\"What's the point of buying it if you can't use AI?\" wrote one user on Weibo, China's X-like platform. Another commented: \"Without AI as the biggest selling point, it should be half price.\"\nApple's shares fell 1.15% in pre-market U.S. trading.\nWhile Apple for years enjoyed strong demand in China, where new iPhone launches once sparked a frenzy, its sales have dwindled and the company's ranking in the world's second-largest economy has now dropped from third to sixth place.\nHuawei made a comeback to the high-end smartphone segment last year with the release of a device powered by a domestically-made chip, defying U.S. sanctions that have cut off its access to the global chipset supply chain. The launch of the Mate 60 Pro surprised analysts and U.S. officials.\nHuawei already has two-way foldable phones in its lineup, and its strong sales in China helped it overtake Samsung Electronics this year as the biggest vendor of such phones globally.\nBut with a price tag that starts at $2,800 - more than twice the starting price of the comparable iPhone 16 Pro Max - and limited production, the tri-fold phone is likely to become more of a symbol of Huawei's tech prowess than a major sales driver, analysts said.\n\"Production constraints and the high price point mean the new phone will likely not have a huge impact in terms of shipments,\" said Will Wong, senior researcher at consultancy IDC.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s telling the consumers that it\u2019s still the tech leader and the potential challenge it brings to Apple may be far beyond just market share.\u201d\nThe foldable smartphone market grew 57% year-on-year in the second quarter with 3.9 million units shipped, largely as Chinese smartphone makers pushed into overseas markets, according to IDC.\nThat remains just 1.3% of the wider smartphone market, with 292.2 million smartphones shipped in the second quarter, IDC said.\nHuawei ranked as the world's biggest foldable smartphone seller in the second quarter with a 27.5% market share, ahead of South Korea's Samsung, with 16.4%, according to IDC.\nThat share rises to 42% in China's home market, ahead of Vivo and former Huawei unit Honor, which it spun off under pressure from U.S. sanctions in 2020.\n($1 = 7.1199 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by David Kirton in Shenzhen, Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul and Liam Mo in Beijing; Writing by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Miyoung Kim, Stephen Coates and Sonali Paul, Miral Fahmy and Christina Fincher)\n"

It has a tactile switch that powers the click experience, a high-precision force sensor that enables the light press gesture, and a capacitive sensor that allows for touch interactions. A new camera preview helps users frame the shot and adjust other control options \u2014 such as zoom, exposure, or depth of field \u2014 to compose a stunning photo or video by sliding their finger on the Camera Control. Later this fall, Camera Control will be updated with a two-stage shutter to automatically lock focus and exposure on a subject with a light press, letting users reframe the shot without losing focus. Additionally, developers will be able to bring Camera Control to third-party apps such as Kino, which will offer users the ability to adjust white balance and set focus points, including at various levels of depth in their scene.\nLater this year, Camera Control will unlock visual intelligence to help users learn about objects and places faster than ever before. Users can click and hold Camera Control to pull up the hours or ratings for a restaurant they pass, add an event from a flyer to their calendar, quickly identify a dog by breed, and more. Camera Control will also serve as a gateway into third-party tools with specific domain expertise, like when users want to search on Google to find where they can buy an item, or to benefit from ChatGPT\u2019s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.\nNew Pro Creativity Across Photo, Video, and Audio\nWith iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the world\u2019s favorite camera gets even more powerful. Powered by A18 Pro, the upgraded camera system introduces a new 48MP Fusion camera with a faster, more efficient quad-pixel sensor and Apple Camera Interface, unlocking 4K120 fps video recording in Dolby Vision \u2014 the highest resolution and frame-rate combination ever available on iPhone, and a smartphone first.

A new 48MP Ultra Wide camera also features a quad-pixel sensor with autofocus, so users can take higher-resolution 48MP ProRAW and HEIF images when capturing uniquely framed, wider-angle shots or getting close to their subjects with macro photography. The powerful 5x Telephoto camera now comes on both iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, allowing users to catch the action from farther away, no matter which model they choose. iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max now take spatial photos in addition to videos to help users relive memories with remarkable depth on Apple Vision Pro\u2122.\nUsers can capture 4K120 fps in Slo-mo or Video mode, and adjust the playback speed after capture in the Photos app, including a quarter-speed playback, a new half-speed option for a dreamy effect, and a fifth-speed option that corresponds to 24 fps. When coupled with the new image signal processor (ISP) of A18 Pro, users can do frame-by-frame cinema-quality color grading for 4K120 fps in Dolby Vision. Users can also capture 4K120 fps ProRes\u00ae and Log directly to an external storage device for efficient pro workflows.\nBoth Pro models feature four new studio-quality mics that preserve true-to-life recorded sounds, and video can now be captured in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods\u00ae, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system. The iPhone 16 Pro lineup also introduces creative new ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix \u2014 allowing users to adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.\nNext-generation Photographic Styles help users express their creativity and customize their photos by locally adjusting color, highlights, and shadows in real time. Styles also have a deeper understanding of skin undertones, so users can personalize how they appear in photos. Unlike filters, which often use a one-size-fits-all approach by adding a color to an entire scene, adjustments are applied to specific colors of a selected style. A wider set of styles offers more creative options for editing a photo\u2019s aesthetic, and styles can be further personalized with an easy-to-use new control pad and intensity slider for simultaneous adjustments across tone and color. These adjustments can be rendered during live preview, applied after a photo is taken, or even reversed later.\nApple Intelligence takes the pro camera system to a new level. Coming later, Siri will be able to complete in-app requests and take action across apps, like pulling up a specific shot from a user\u2019s Photos library and then applying an edit to the image in Darkroom. Siri can also help users fully utilize the wide range of photo and editing capabilities, such as asking how to adjust the blur in the background of a photo.\nIndustry-Leading Performance and Power Efficiency\nThe new A18 Pro chip is designed with industry-leading compute power to propel Apple Intelligence, ushering in a new era of pro performance. Built with second-generation 3-nanometer technology and featuring a new architecture with smaller, faster transistors, A18 Pro delivers unprecedented efficiency. The new 16-core Neural Engine is faster and more efficient than the previous generation, powering remarkable on-device performance for Apple Intelligence. A 17 percent increase in total system memory bandwidth \u2014 the highest ever in iPhone \u2014 enables faster experiences when using Writing Tools and Image Playground, and helps deliver astounding graphics. The bandwidth increase also benefits the 6-core GPU, which is up to 20 percent faster than the previous generation, driving graphics rendering for Apple Intelligence and stunning visuals for gaming. Hardware-accelerated ray tracing gets up to 2x faster for even more realistic light sources and reflections, and Game Mode in iOS 18 unlocks more consistent frame rates while making AirPods, game controllers, and other wireless accessories incredibly responsive.

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "Apple's launch of the iPhone 16 has failed to impress consumers in China hoping to get a taste of its artificial intelligence (AI) technology, as the US tech giant grapples with competition from local behemoth Huawei Technologies, which launched a rival device just hours later.\nThe Cupertino, California-based smartphone maker on Monday unveiled the highly anticipated iPhone 16 series, its first AI-powered smartphone line-up. While many Chinese users have expressed excitement about Apple Intelligence, the firm's on-device AI system, others pointed out that the feature will not be available in the Chinese language until next year.\nSome consumers also questioned whether Apple's promise to roll out the AI function in Chinese-speaking regions will cover the mainland, where generative AI technology is heavily regulated. To date, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has approved 188 large language models for public use in the country, none of which are released by foreign companies.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nGlobally, Apple's built-in AI is powered in part by OpenAI's GPT models, which have not been made available in China. Apple said on its website that the launch date of its AI feature in China will depend on the decision of Chinese regulators.\nApple CEO Tim Cook holds the new iPhone 16 Pro Max during an event at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, on Monday. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Apple CEO Tim Cook holds the new iPhone 16 Pro Max during an event at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, on Monday. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\"The absence of AI in China is akin to cutting one of Apple's arms,\" one commentator said on microblogging site Weibo. \"With the biggest selling point unavailable, shouldn't you charge us half the price?\" read a popular comment.\nApple introduced four models of the latest version of its flagship device: the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, with prices starting at 5,999 yuan (US$843). Pre-orders will start on Friday, with shipments commencing on September 20.\nDemand for the new iPhones in China is expected to come mainly from existing users because of the delayed arrival of Chinese-language AI, according to Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at consultancy Counterpoint Research.\n\"Apple Intelligence has not shown a clear advantage over the AI functions offered by other Chinese brands either, so the impact of AI will be limited for iPhone,\" he added. Lam expects Apple's sales growth in China to slow substantially next year, although fourth-quarter sales this year could be higher than the year-earlier period.\nApple's iPhone 16 is competing against Huawei's new Mate XT, a three-way foldable smartphone. Photo: Reuters alt=Apple's iPhone 16 is competing against Huawei's new Mate XT, a three-way foldable smartphone. Photo: Reuters>\nArthur Guo, a senior analyst with research firm IDC, said Apple shipments in mainland China are forecast to decline 0.8 per cent to 46.7 million units this year, although iPhone sales could pick up in 2025.\nThe lack of major hardware innovations in the iPhone 16 also drew the scorn of some consumers in China, who compared the launch to desperately squeezing the last bit of toothpaste out of the tube. The analogy became a trending term on Weibo on Tuesday morning.\nHong Yi, a programmer who uses the iPhone 15, said he will not upgrade because it is unclear when iPhone's AI capabilities will come to China.\nBut Mark Ma, a media professional based in Beijing who uses an iPhone 11, plans to buy an iPhone 16. \"I don't think the new iPhone lacks capabilities,\" he said, although the price did give him a pause. Still, he called the latest model \"a bang on the buck\".\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "  Nick Paul Taylor ",
        "Text": "This story was originally published on MedTech Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily MedTech Dive newsletter. \nRecommended Reading \nApple adding sleep apnea feature to smartwatch\nThe Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it authorized a hearing aid feature for certain versions of Apple\u2019s Airpods Pro earbuds.\nApple applied via the de novo premarket review pathway and is the first company to receive authorization for over-the-counter hearing aid software. The company disclosed its plans to add hearing aid capabilities to its earbuds on Monday.\nThe authorization comes almost two years after FDA regulations allowed hearing aids to be sold without a prescription to people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Initially, companies focused on hardware, but the Apple authorization creates a predicate for other businesses that want to launch hearing aid software for existing products.\nApple applied for de novo authorization in December. The company validated the technology in a study that enrolled 118 people with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss at multiple U.S. sites.\nParticipants who self-fitted Apple earbuds achieved similar perceived benefits as people who had the same devices fitted by professionals. Measures of amplification and speech understanding were comparable as well.\u00a0\nThe FDA identified physical discomfort, worsening hearing because of high volumes, insufficient sound amplification leading to ineffective treatment and poorer than expected patient outcomes\u00a0and missed or delayed treatment as potential risks of the software. The administration has outlined mitigation measures for each of the risks.\nGuided by the risks, the FDA has created special controls for air-conduction hearing aid software such as Apple\u2019s new earbud technology. Companies that want to bring similar software to market via the 510(k) pathway will need to validate self-fitting strategies using clinical performance data, show intended users can correctly operate the hearing aid and meet other special controls established by the FDA.\n\u00a0Apple targeted a fall launch date for the hearing aid capabilities when it unveiled the incoming feature earlier this week. Once the software is rolled out, Airpods Pro 2 users will be able to perform a pure-tone audiometry test to check their hearing at home and have their devices boost certain sounds based on the results.\nThe launch will create competition for the wave of companies that entered the OTC hearing aid market when the FDA changed its regulations in 2022. Sony and the Bose-partnered Lexie began selling devices for $999, while Lucid and HP rolled out cheaper products.\nPeople ages 18 years and older will be able to use the devices to check their hearing when the software goes live.\nMichelle Tarver, acting director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement the software \u201cadvances the availability, accessibility and acceptability of hearing support.\u201d \n"

        "Title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among the Best Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks to Buy",
        "Author": "  Vardah Gill ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Warren Buffett dividend stocks.\nAlthough the financial world is often seen as serious and analytical, short selling introduces an element of excitement and complexity to market dynamics. Short selling is a strategy where investors borrow shares of a stock, anticipating that the market price will drop by the time they need to purchase the shares to return them. While many short sellers have scaled back since the meme stock frenzy began, the strategy of betting against stocks remains in practice. Short sellers saw strong gains in the second quarter of this year, successfully betting against stocks despite the broader market's upward trend. Data from S3 Partners LLC showed they earned $10 billion in paper profits during the quarter. These gains, driven by sectors like industrials, healthcare, and financials, helped offset a $15.7 billion mark-to-market loss in the technology sector.\nThe fact that short sellers were able to profit while the market was rising suggests that investors are concentrating on a handful of large-cap tech stocks amid an uncertain economic environment, leaving vulnerabilities in other sectors. During the quarter ending June 28, the broader market gained roughly 4%. Meanwhile, the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 Index saw a 7.8% gain over the same period.\nAlso read:\n10 Worst Booming Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers\nIt's clear that short sellers capitalize on overlooked or troubled areas of the market. Last year, the turmoil in regional banks attracted short sellers, who stirred controversy by examining lenders' balance sheets for vulnerabilities linked to rising interest rates and betting against their stocks. In 2023, while the broader market rallied, this sector became a key area of success for these traders. The volatility that affected regional bank stocks earlier this year again generated substantial paper profits for short sellers, echoing the gains they made during last year's upheaval in the sector. Now analysts are viewing short sellers in a completely new perspective. Carson Block, the founder of Muddy Waters Research, is convinced that markets need short sellers more than ever. However, he notes that a persistent stock rally and new regulatory challenges are creating difficulties for his bearish colleagues, who are struggling to secure capital. Here are some comments from the investor:\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to demonize short sellers as part of a populist message and somehow call us the suits. The market needs short sellers more than ever given the amount of games that are being played, but if the long-side doesn\u2019t care, this can continue \u2014 until it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nAlongside Block, numerous respected investors and experts have emphasized that short selling plays a crucial role in public markets. It helps enhance price accuracy, ensures better capital allocation, prevents financial bubbles, and uncovers fraud. In 2006, during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett highlighted that financially strong companies could benefit from short sellers, as they eventually have to buy back the stock. He believes short sellers often uncover wrongdoing or suspicious activities. Buffett remarked that there is nothing inherently wrong with short selling, noting that in many cases where there has been significant short interest, the companies involved were later exposed as fraudulent or engaging in questionable practices. With this, we will take a look at some of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks according to short sellers.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this list, we first scanned Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 13F portfolio as of Q2 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that list, we shortlisted dividend companies with the lowest percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short as of September 15 and ranked them in descending order of the stocks\u2019 short interest.\nWe also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 0.89%\nIn the second quarter of 2024, short sellers faced significant losses, losing billions of dollars by betting against major, well-known stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was among the three least profitable short positions during this period, as its stock price jumped by 23% in Q2 2024. According to analysts, weak iPhone sales and regulatory challenges in the EU and the USA may be affecting sentiment, but the influence of market perceptions on interest rate trends should not be overlooked either.\nIn fiscal Q3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a 14.5% QoQ decline in its iPhone sales at over $39.2 billion. The company's overall revenue for the quarter came in at $85.7 billion, which saw a 5% hike from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company was pleased to reveal significant updates to its software platforms at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Among these updates was Apple Intelligence, a revolutionary personal intelligence system that integrates advanced, private generative AI models into iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices. Despite its declining iPhone sales, analysts are still optimistic about the company. Baron Funds also discussed this in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\u201cThe Fund\u2019s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn\u2019t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple\u2019s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also reported a strong cash position. The company generated over $29 billion in operating cash flow and returned $32 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Moreover, the company has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 12 years, which makes AAPL one of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks. Its quarterly dividend currently sits at $0.25 per share for a dividend yield of 0.45%, as of September 15.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) garnered a lot of attention from elite money managers during the second quarter of 2024. Insider Monkey's database of Q2 2024 indicated that 184 hedge funds held stakes in the company, growing from 150 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $124 billion.\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Large Cap Stocks Jim Cramer Can\u2019t Stop Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other large cap stocks Jim Cramer can\u2019t stop talking about.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer highlights a critical gap in the American education system, which often overlooks financial literacy despite its importance. While students may graduate with extensive knowledge in subjects like chemistry, history, and languages, they rarely receive practical education on managing personal finances. Cramer emphasizes that financial planning, retirement readiness, and investing are seldom covered, leaving many people uninformed about crucial money management skills.\n\u201cThere is a gaping hole in the American education system, although I hesitate even to call it a system. When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\nCramer\u2019s mission is to bridge this gap through the CNBC Investing Club, where he and the Charitable Trust provide practical financial guidance. He stresses the significance of retirement planning, noting that while 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are key tools for saving, many people lack comprehensive understanding of their benefits and limitations.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m on a constant mission to teach you how to manage your money, which is what we do every day in the CNBC Investing Club, with the Charitable Trust providing a constant source of examples. When it comes to managing your money, nothing is more important than retirement. Sooner or later, you\u2019re going to stop working\u2014hopefully sooner rather than later, unless you really love your job. I\u2019m betting most of you, even if you don\u2019t own individual stocks, still have some money in a 401(k) plan.\nCramer points out that while contributing to a 401(k) is widely advised, it\u2019s not always the best strategy for everyone. Despite its tax advantages and the ability to defer taxes on contributions, 401(k) plans can have drawbacks, such as hidden fees that diminish returns.\n\u201cHear me out, darn it\u2014you need to know this stuff. Your future self will thank you for getting your retirement funds in order. While you may think you know everything you need to know about these tax-favored accounts, the truth is there\u2019s a lot the so-called experts don\u2019t tell you or don\u2019t want you to know. For example, conventional wisdom says that you absolutely must invest in your 401(k)\u2014you\u2019d have to be a fool not to contribute.\nHe argues that understanding both the benefits and the shortcomings of these retirement accounts is essential for making informed financial decisions. Cramer encourages individuals to educate themselves about these investment options to ensure their retirement savings are managed effectively.\n\u201cHowever, sometimes I think it can be the wrong approach. I\u2019m not going to sing the praises of the noble 401(k) plan or tell you it\u2019s the key to your financial salvation because 401(k) plans can be a real mixed bag. Sure, they have a couple of really great features, but they also have a lot of bad ones, and those problematic features will eat away at your returns\u2014sometimes through fees that are almost totally hidden from you. I do not like that. So let me lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly of 401(k) plans. Then I\u2019ll tell you whether it makes sense for you to contribute more money to your own 401(k)\u2014maybe there\u2019s a better way for you to invest for retirement.\u201d\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nMarket Capitalization: 3.38T\nJim Cramer explains that while some experts argue that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock appears expensive, this perspective overlooks the company\u2019s strong cash flow, which supports its value. Cramer highlights a recent insightful piece by Ben Rice from Melius, which argues that despite the market\u2019s current overbought conditions, investors should hold onto their Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock.\n\u201cAnother firm mentioned that Apple\u2019s stock is expensive, which it is\u2014unless you consider the cash flow instead of just the earnings. The piece by the irrepressible Ben Rice from Melius made so much sense that you know you need to hold on tight and not feel compelled to sell your Apple stock when the market gets overbought, as it is now. The tech titans, the hyperscalers, the colossal portion of the market\u2014yes, the mega stocks\u2014they just come back every time you sell. But short-term signals say to sell. To me, that means it\u2019s time to bunker down and accept the unavoidable small losses. These stocks are just too good to let go. Bottom line: Hold on to them.\u201d\nIn Q3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenues of $85.78 billion, marking a 5% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven primarily by a 14% rise in services revenue, which reached an all-time high of $24.21 billion. Key services like iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store have become significant contributors to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s financial success, demonstrating its ability to perform well even amid economic challenges. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s net income also grew nearly 8% year-over-year to $21.45 billion, with earnings per share rising to $1.40, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations.\nApple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

        "Author": "  Silin Chen ",
        "Text": "Arm doesn\u2019t produce chips, but its design is probably in your smartphone.\nApple\u2019s latest iPhone 16 series, featuring A18 chips that power its AI feature, Apple Intelligence, is using Arm\u2019s newest V9 chip design, the Financial Times reported.\nThe UK semiconductor company has a multiyear licensing agreement with Apple.\nLast year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max devices, which can also contain Apple Intelligence, were built on Arm\u2019s previous generation V8 architecture.\nRelated: Analyst revisits Apple stock price target after iPhone 16 launch\nCompanies like Apple, Samsung, and Nvidia use Arm Holdings' central-processing-unit chip architectures. Arm then receives licensing payments and royalties based on the number of products sold.\nLicense revenue comes from granting the right to use its intellectual property, while royalty revenue is the continuous fee payment based on the usage or sales of that IP.\nArm\u2019s Chief Executive Rene Haas has said that the V9 chip design earns twice the royalties of the V8 generation, with estimated rates around 4%, compared with the average 1.7% royalty rates for prior generations.\nThis increase enables Arm to claim more revenue from each V9 chip sold.\n\u201cAs a CFO, it\u2019s one of the better business models I\u2019ve seen. I joke sometimes that those older products are like the Beatles catalog: They just keep delivering royalties. Some of those products are three decades old,\u201d Arm Chief Financial Officer Jason Child said in a CNBC interview.\nShutterstock\nArm's\u00a0 (ARM) \u00a0fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, reported on July 31, exceeded analysts' forecasts, but the shares slumped due to tepid guidance.\nThe company earned 40 cents a share adjusted, beating Wall Street's expectation of 34 cents. Its revenue of $939 million was up 39%, higher than analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of $902.7 million.\nRelated: Analysts reboot Arm Holdings stock price target following earnings\nHowever, Arm maintained its full-year guidance of adjusted earnings per share between $1.45 and $1.65, with revenue expected to range from $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion. Analysts had projected adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 and revenue of $4.02 billion.\nDespite a 40% slump in July and August, Arm stock has about doubled this year.\nThe surge in artificial intelligence activity will continue to drive chip sales in the coming years.\n\"As the energy needs of AI continue to escalate, so does the demand for the high-performance, power-efficient Arm compute platform,\" Haas said in a shareholder letter.\nA month ago, Bernstein upgraded Arm to market perform from underperform with a price target of $100, up from $92, following the 40% drop.\nBernstein said on Aug. 7 that Arm's valuation needed to be revisited, given the share price's 40% drop in four weeks and more confidence in mobile royalty growth.\nBernstein says V9 products will contribute significantly to the company's royalties, reaching 40% by the end of fiscal 2025. The analyst said Arm was gaining market share in the cloud-computing sector. Given these developments, Bernstein views the stock's potential risks and rewards as more evenly balanced at its current price.\nMorgan Stanley affirmed a positive outlook toward Arm stock following the iPhone 16 release on Aug. 12 because of the utilization of Arm\u2019s chip design.\nMore AI Stocks:\nPalantir stock leaps on big S&P 500 boost for data analytics group\nVeteran fund manager unveils startling Nvidia stock forecast\nAnalysts reset Alphabet stock price target before key September court event\n\u201cArm remains a favored play on the emerging Edge AI opportunity,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyst Lee Simpson said, expecting mobile to drive initial upside, followed by infrastructure and autos.\nMorgan Stanley affirms a $175 price target with an overweight rating on Arm stock.\nOn\u00a0Sept. 5, according to TheFly,\u00a0the investment firm named it a Joint Top Pick along with ASM International\u00a0 (ASMIY) .\u00a0For ASM International the analyst cut the price target to 725 euros ($801) from 800 euros.\nAnd Morgan Stanley affirmed an overweight rating on ASML Holding\u00a0 (ASML) \u00a0while cutting its price target on the stock to 925 euros from 1,000 euros and removing it as a Top Pick, TheFly reported.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got a Grim Warning From Apple and Amazon",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. In fact, analysts estimate its graphics processing units account for up to 95% of AI chip sales. But history is full of cautionary tales about the downfall of dominant brands that failed to maintain their technological leadership.\nIBM was once a highly esteemed computing company due to its mainframes and storage solutions, but it failed to innovate around cloud computing and PCs. Cisco was briefly the most valuable company in the world, back when the internet buildout drove demand for its networking products, but it no longer ranks among the top 50 because it failed to innovate.\nThose are just two examples from a long list that includes AOL, BlackBerry, Blockbuster, Kodak, and MySpace. To be clear, Nvidia is in no immediate danger of joining that list, but history says shareholders would be foolish to dismiss the idea completely. Indeed, recent warnings from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) make it clear that Nvidia is not immune to competition.\nHere are the important details.\nEarlier this year, Apple announced a set of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for iOS and macOS devices called Apple Intelligence. Features include drafting and revising text, generating images, and summarizing notifications, as well as a more capable version of the personal assistant Siri. Apple Intelligence will launch in late October.\nIn July, Apple published a technical paper stating, \"Apple Intelligence consists of multiple highly capable generative models that are fast, efficient, specialized for our users' everyday tasks, and can adapt on the fly for their current activity.\" The paper also detailed how two of those models -- one that runs on devices for simple tasks, and another that runs in private data centers for more sophisticated tasks -- were trained.\nImportantly, Apple did not use Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to develop its large language models. It used custom silicon called tensor processing units (TPUs) designed by Alphabet's Google and Broadcom. Notably, Broadcom is also helping other companies design custom AI chips, including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and ByteDance, according to JPMorgan Chase.\nHere's the bottom line: Apple's decision to use TPUs rather than GPUs to train its AI models is a warning that viable alternatives to Nvidia exist. The relative importance of that decision is yet to be determined. If Apple Intelligence is glitchy, it may turn into a cautionary tale about what happens when companies stray from the industry standard. But if Apple Intelligence is well received by consumers, Apple's decision to use TPUs may inspire other companies to do the same.\nAlphabet's Google is not the only public cloud to develop custom AI silicon. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has done the same thing. Its custom chips -- Trainium for AI training and Inferentia for AI inference -- are not designed to outshine Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to give customers a more cost effective alternative.\nAlphabet and Amazon have deep partnerships with Nvidia. Both companies offer compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and that will not change anytime soon. Nvidia GPUs are the gold standard in data center accelerators, so it would be nonsensical to not offer that option. However, both companies have seen fit to develop their own chips on the side.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said:\n\"We've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling on price performance. We are seeing significant demand for these chips.\"\nHere's the bottom line: Some companies will gladly pay a premium for Nvidia GPUs, but demand for AWS's custom silicon shows that other companies will gladly use slower chips to save money. In other words, AWS (like Apple) is warning investors that Nvidia will almost certainly lose market share in the future, which could pressure the company's margins as it fights to compete with cheaper alternatives.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. Don't believe it? Then look at the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price. It's 328% higher than it was five years ago. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 18% gain in the last three months.\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n Check out our latest analysis for Apple \nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nOver half a decade, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 34% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Apple's TSR for the last 5 years was 342%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nApple provided a TSR of 21% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 35% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

        "Title": "Apple's New iPhone 16 Didn't Seem All That Impressive. But Here's Why Its Sales Numbers Could Be Strong.",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has grown more diverse over the years with the launch of services to help enhance its top line and to expand its already robust ecosystem. But ultimately, this is still a company that relies heavily on iPhone sales, which today account for approximately half of all revenue for the company.\nAs Apple sells more iPhones, particularly to new customers, that also means more people are in its ecosystem and using its services. This is why the newest iPhone can be an extremely important indicator for the business' future growth, as a strong performance could lead to greater revenue on other fronts.\nRecently, Apple unveiled its latest phone, the iPhone 16. While it will provide users with a phone that is ready for artificial intelligence (AI) features, it may not be all that exciting. But looks can be deceiving, and early accounts are that the new iPhone is doing just fine. Here's why it could be a big growth catalyst for the business.\nA good way to gauge how the iPhone is doing is by listening to what executives at major telecom companies are saying. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert isn't seeing any issues at all since the launch of the new iPhone. In a recent interview with CNBC, Sievert said sales are strong across the board: \"People are buying Pros, they're buying Maxes, so they're buying up the food chain, and they're buying at a greater rate than last year.\" He also dismissed analyst reports which suggested that sales weren't off to a strong start as \"nonsense.\"\nThe caveat, of course, is that the iPhone has only been available for preorder since Sept. 9. There's a possibility that people rushed to place orders in advance and due to the expectation of it being a big hit, which led to strong sales performance based solely on that anticipation. However, Sievert hasn't hinted at any drop off yet.\nBut with\u00a0people holding on to their phones a lot longer these days due to inflation and perhaps a lack of new and compelling features from Apple in its previous iPhones, it may also not take a whole lot to convince them to finally upgrade. The promise of new AI features could be sufficient.\nOne thing that stood out to me in Sievert's interview is that he also believes the sales cycle could last longer than normal, simply because Apple hasn't rolled out all of its AI features yet, and they might not all be available until 2025.\nWhether it's by design or not, that could truly be a genius move for the company, as it may lead to multiple catalysts for the iPhone 16. The first is the launch of the phone itself, then successive ones could be the announcement of new AI features. For customers who are on the fence about upgrading right now and who may not be among those who have placed orders for the iPhone 16, news of an exciting new AI capability could be what convinces them to upgrade sooner rather than later.\nThrough the quarter ended June 29, Apple's iPhone sales totaled $39.3 billion, which is slightly less than the $39.7 billion it posted in the same period last year. Over the past three quarters, iPhone sales are also down by a little more than 1%.\nBy having some softer numbers of late, Apple could be due for some stronger quarters ahead. The reality is that it may not necessarily need a big new feature to lead to strong revenue growth. The ability for users to be able to take advantage of AI may be enough to do the trick.\nShares of Apple are up 18% this year, as it has largely been keeping pace with how the markets have been doing. As a leader in the smartphone market, Apple can always make for a good growth stock to buy if you're willing to hang on for the long haul.\nInvestors shouldn't worry too much about Apple's short-term performance from one quarter to the next. Even if this iPhone may not be the one that triggers a huge flurry of upgrades, the next one might. Regardless of how strong iPhone 16 sales prove to be, Apple remains one of the safest investments you can hold in your portfolio for the long haul.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 773% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 168% for the S&P 500.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 23, 2024\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-09-02, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $174.53. It's currently trading at a price of $229. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -31.21%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.57\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.91%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n89.93\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n84.59\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n174.53\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $154.88. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -47.86%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (APLE): A Good Stock That Pay Dividends Monthly",
        "Author": "  Vardah Gill ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks that Pay Dividends Monthly.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) stands against the other stocks that pay dividends monthly.\nOver the years, dividend stocks have consistently demonstrated resilience in challenging market conditions. While the recent focus on AI might suggest otherwise, the long-term attractiveness of these stocks has increased. Income investors have taken note of this trend, which is reflected in the growing role of dividends as a portion of personal income. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the share of dividend income has risen from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024, highlighting dividends as a significant source of income. The report also mentioned that since 1936, dividends have contributed to over one-third of the broader market's total equity returns, with the remaining two-thirds coming from capital appreciation.\nThis highlights how dividends have become increasingly important over the years. When considering inflation, dividends have outpaced it, suggesting that investors should focus on these stocks. A report by Wisdom Tree noted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends grew by an average of 5.7% annually, which is more than 2% higher than the inflation rate. The report also pointed out that in the last 64 years, dividends only declined in six years, and only once by more than 5%. In contrast, stock prices fell in 18 of those years, with the worst annual decline exceeding 40% and an average drop of over 11%. Stock prices were more than twice as volatile as the dividend cash flows, as short-term prices are more influenced by market sentiment, while long-term value is driven by cash flow stability.\nAlso read:\n10 Highest Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks\nWhen investing in dividend stocks, receiving payments more often is definitely a plus. Although most dividend stocks distribute payments to shareholders on a quarterly basis, there are a few hundred publicly traded companies that opt to pay dividends monthly instead. However, monthly dividend stocks have their downsides. While they offer appealing investment opportunities, their high yields can be misleading, often accompanied by multiple dividend cuts. The high yields are primarily due to the nature of the companies that opt for monthly payments, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), closed-end funds, business development companies (BDCs), and royalty trusts, which are common among monthly dividend payers. That said, many monthly dividend companies have not only kept up their payouts over the years but have also increased them, all while maintaining high yields.\nOnce the risks associated with high yields are addressed, investors can concentrate on the benefits of compounding. Monthly dividend stocks provide cash to investors more frequently than other stocks, allowing them to reinvest it sooner and take advantage of faster compounding. Since 1960, 85% of the cumulative total return of the broader market Index can be traced back to reinvested dividends and the effects of compounding, as reported by Hartford Funds. With this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that offer monthly payouts.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this list, we reviewed a list of companies providing monthly dividends to their shareholders. Among these, we specifically chose businesses with robust dividend practices, consistently maintaining their payouts across multiple years. The majority of these selected companies operate within the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, as they are required to allocate 90% of their income towards dividends. From that list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database of 912 hedge funds and their holdings.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nLong exposure of a busy city skyline featuring tall roof tops of different hotel brands.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 19\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) is a Virginia-based real estate investment trust company that operates in hotel properties across the US. The company's portfolio includes 224 hotels with over 30,000 guest rooms, spread across 87 markets in 37 states and the District of Columbia. The portfolio is concentrated on leading industry brands, featuring 100 Marriott-branded hotels, 119 Hilton-branded hotels, and five Hyatt-branded hotels.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE)'s business fundamentals remained robust, supported by a slower rate of new supply growth compared to historical levels. Its comparable hotel occupancy reached 80%, which is more than a 2% increase from the same quarter in 2023. While the greatest potential for continued growth is expected from the ongoing improvement in midweek business travel demand, the company also achieved higher occupancy rates on both weekdays and weekends during the quarter. This reflects the resilience of leisure travel demand and the benefits being realized as business travel patterns return to normal. Comparable hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) for the second quarter rose by 2.5% compared to the previous year, accompanied by a slight increase in average daily rate (ADR).\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE), one of the best dividend stocks, has been making uninterrupted dividend payments to shareholders since 2008. The company offers a monthly dividend of $0.08 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.73%, as of August 29.\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) was a popular buy among elite funds during Q2 2024, with hedge fund positions growing to 19, from 13 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's database. These stakes have a total value of more than $116.5 million. With over 2.6 million shares, Balyasny Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q2.\nOverall APLE ranks 6th on our list of the stocks that pay dividends monthly. While we acknowledge the potential APLE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APLE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

But the tech giant isn't the only company that stands to benefit from sales of the artificial intelligence-powered phone.\nThe latest iPhone, officially announced Monday, is powered by the A18 chip, which according to a Monday Financial Times report and other sources is based on an Arm Holdings (ARM) design. Shares of Arm jumped 7% Monday following the report; they were retreating Tuesday.\nThe A18 chip runs on a processor made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

        "Title": "With Apple Intelligence, iPhone users will finally get a better Siri",
        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "Will Siri finally become useful? That's the promise Apple laid out today at its \"Glowtime\" event, where the company introduced its iPhone 16 lineup \u2014 its first new iPhones to ship with AI-powered functionality, courtesy of Apple Intelligence and, later, a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\nWhile consumers won't get the full impact of the Siri upgrade until Apple Intelligence launches, Apple promises it will upend the user experience by making the iPhone not just a small computer that fits in your pocket, but also a small personal assistant powered by AI.\nIn the near term, Siri will see more immediate improvements, including the ability to type questions to Siri instead of speaking and to engage in more natural conversations -- including the occasional stumble -- thanks to its richer language understanding. You'll also be able to change the wake word for Siri through a new accessibility feature.\nDevelopers are gaining access to SiriKit, which allows them to integrate Apple Intelligence-powered features into their own apps, the way that Apple has integrated Siri with first-party apps like Calendar, Mail, Notes, Safari, Files, Contacts, Voice Memos, Photos, Books, Freeform, Files and others.\nEven Apple's AirPods are getting an upgraded Siri experience, as users will be able to nod or shake their heads in response to Siri announcements.\nTo showcase its new AI functionality, Siri will receive a cosmetic makeover in iOS 18. Instead of a glowing orb at the bottom of the screen when activated, Siri will light up the edges of the iPhone in an eye-catching illumination. This will appear when Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad, or CarPlay.\nUnlike new iPhones, Apple Intelligence \u2014 meaning the best of Siri's upgrade \u2014 will be a slower rollout. Apple says the first set of features will be available in beta next month, with more features rolling out in the coming months. U.S. English will initially be supported, followed by localized English for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.K. Sometime next year, it will reach users who speak Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish before expanding to others.\nOther Apple Intelligence features like Writing Tools, Mail and Notifications summaries, and a Clean Up tool in Photos will also arrive in beta starting next month across iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1.\nWhen Apple Intelligence arrives, Siri will be able to help with questions and commands that deal with its understanding of you and your needs. It will gain a better understanding of your personal context, allowing you to reference things like a song you streamed, an email you reviewed, a calendar appointment, or a text, for instance, instead of only responding to simple commands like \"call Mom.\" That means you'll be able to ask Siri about your meeting and what the weather will be like at the meeting's location, too, or do something like instructing it to send an email you had drafted.\n\"With Siri's personal context, understanding and action capabilities, you'll be able to simply say, 'Send Erica the photos from Saturday's barbecue,' and Siri will dig up the photos and send them right off with new ways to express yourself and read them memories, along with tools to help you prioritize and focus so you can get more done,\" noted Apple SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, at today's iPhone announcement. \"Apple intelligence is going to transform so much of what you do with iPhone. Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update,\" he said.\nSiri will also be able to offer tech support, as its understanding of your Apple products, features, and functionality will be improved.\nIt will be able to help you in other ways an assistant could, too, by way of its on-screen awareness.\nFor instance, you'll be able to tell Siri to add a friend's address to their contact card after they text it to you, or ask it to edit a photo with a filter or drop that photo into another app. If a friend texts you about a new album, you can say \"play that.\"\nYou could also add a set of photos to an album using Siri, or send them to a friend. And you can have Siri summarize a transcript of a recording.\nOn iPhone 16 Pro models, Apple suggests that Siri's new capabilities will be great for photographers, who will be able to ask Siri to pull up a specific shot from their library and then apply the Edit to the photo in an app like Darkroom, or even use Siri to quickly get suggestions on \"how to enhance the space and achieve their vision,\" the company said on Monday.\nThe bigger Siri upgrade, however, may not come directly from Apple, but from OpenAI, announced earlier this year at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference.\nWith the arrival of Apple Intelligence, Siri users will have the option to pose their questions related to \"world knowledge\" to ChatGPT instead of being frustratingly directed to the web for those questions it can't answer.\nThe partnership with OpenAI helps Apple get ahead in the AI race, where it's perceived to have fallen behind, but without taking on the responsibility or the reputational hit that comes from when AI gets things wrong or hallucinates an answer.\nIn time, Apple is expected to announce more AI partners as well.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PugKQZHPut8This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/09/with-apple-intelligence-iphone-users-will-finally-get-a-better-siri/\n"
