        "Title": "Why I Sold Some Apple Stock to End 2023 and Where I'm Investing Instead",
        "Author": "  Nicholas Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks prized for growth and earnings stability, helped propel the overall stock market back toward all-time highs in 2023.\nApple's performance was rock solid despite higher interest rates and a resulting weakening of global consumer spending. When accounting for reinvested dividends, Apple stock's total return was an incredible 45% in 2023.\nThough I favor making small, gradual portfolio changes over time, I decided to sell some Apple stock near the end of 2023. Here's why and where I invested instead.\nThrough thick and thin, I've owned Apple for many years. 2023 was an interesting year. Despite being part of the vaunted group of Magnificent Seven tech giants (thanks to the aforementioned stock price outperformance), it was actually far from a perfect year for Apple.\nThe iPhone remains far and away the flagship product, accounting for 52% of the company's $383 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended in September). But as I wrote in November, even iPhone sales fell slightly. Paired with a steep drop in the PC (primarily the MacBook for Apple) and other consumer electronics markets (e.g., iPad, Watch, AirPods, Beats), not even the ongoing growth in Services was enough to keep Apple revenue on the rise.\nApple was able to offset this weakness with ample share repurchases. It repurchased and retired $77.6 billion worth of stock, effectively reducing its share count by 3% last year and boosting earnings per share for shareholders.\nThat was a great strategy for investors during the bear market over the last couple of years, and my over-allocation to Apple helped keep my portfolio afloat. However, slow growth and stock buybacks may not be the best strategies if you believe (as I do) a new bull market might be in the early innings.\nApple stock looks expensive, given the sluggish earnings growth expected for 2024. In fact, of all the Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple has the lowest long-term earnings growth rate (9% expected), yet trades for a premium 28 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for next year's earnings.\nThis is why I sold some Apple to redeploy the proceeds elsewhere. That said, I still have plenty of Apple stock. That now comes primarily via my old index fund investments in Vanguard Growth ETF (of which Apple is about 13% of the portfolio), Vanguard Information Technology ETF (22% of the portfolio), and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (nearly 50% of Berkshire's publicly traded stock holdings).\nNevertheless, with Apple maturing into a slower-growth business, and given that I have decades left before I need my investment dollars, I felt it necessary to trim and rebalance.\nWhen looking for a replacement for my portfolio rebalance, I started with the Magnificent Seven themselves. I already purchased additional Alphabet last year. However, the other two parts of the big digital advertising market -- Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- still look attractively priced for an expected rally in earnings in 2024. I've been building up a larger position in Amazon as it figures out how better to monetize its massive e-commerce and digital consumer empire.\nAfter an epic year for the buildout of generative AI infrastructure (mostly to Nvidia's gain), I think beaten-up software stocks could benefit in 2024 as all that newly installed AI hardware starts to get monetized. I added to a longtime position in Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) again and am looking to finally start buying ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) sometime this year. Other cloud computing stocks look compelling for the new year as well.\nAnd, of course, I still like semiconductor stocks, too, especially if the iPhone and other consumer electronic sales notch a rebound in 2024.\nTo be clear, Apple looks like it has all the ingredients to continue as a great long-term investment. Growth may be more moderate than in times past, but the tech titan is highly profitable and doles out ample cash to shareholders. I'm happy to continue holding, but a high valuation compared to some other tech stocks makes me think there are better growth opportunities available right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has split its stock five times since its IPO in 1980. It executed three 2-for-1 splits in 1987, 2000, and 2005, a 7-for-1 split in 2014, and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Those splits would have turned 100 shares bought prior to the first one into 22,400 shares -- and anyone who bought 100 shares at its IPO price of $22 and held on would have seen their initial $2,200 investment turn into a holding worth more than $4.2 million today.\nNow, those stock splits didn't actually make Apple's shares more valuable. They simply carved its existing shares into smaller ownership slices of the company, which reduced their prices and made them easier to trade on the options market where a single contract needs to be tethered to 100 shares. The underlying valuation of the company, and of investors' positions in it, remained the same.\nMost brokerages now make it easy for retail investors to buy and sell fractional shares, so they won't be prevented from putting money into a company because it has too high a share price and stock splits don't matter as much as they used to. That said, stock splits still usually generate a lot of media buzz and attract the attention of retail investors who might be more inclined to purchase shares of a stock with a double-digit price tag instead of a triple-digit one.\nSo could Apple split its stock, which currently trades at around $186 per share, in the near future?\nWhen Apple announced its last 4-for-1 split on July 30, 2020, its stock was trading at $385. When it announced its previous 7-for-1 split on April 23, 2014, it was trading at $525.\nBased on those two decisions, it doesn't seem likely that Apple will choose to split its stock at its current level of around $200 a share. It has also been just three and a half years since its last split, and the shortest period between its stock splits has been nearly five years (2000 to 2005) so far. Therefore, it will probably be at least a few more years before Apple's board approves another stock split.\nApple is already worth almost $2.9 trillion, which makes it one of the two most valuable companies in the world alongside Microsoft. (Microsoft briefly moved ahead of Apple to take the No. 1 spot on Thursday.)\u00a0 It could be difficult for Apple to grow its market cap meaningfully from there as its revenue growth and earnings growth cool off.\nAnalysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only rise 4% and 8%, respectively, in its fiscal 2024 (which will end in September) as iPhone sales slow down. Its iPhone sales fell 2% in fiscal 2023 -- due to the end of the 5G upgrade cycle and macroeconomic challenges in China -- but the flagship smartphone still accounted for over half of the company's total revenue.\nDeclining sales of Macs in the post-pandemic market and currency headwinds exacerbated that slowdown. Apple is trying to offset that pressure by expanding its services ecosystem, which now features more than a billion paid subscriptions, but it remains overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone. A patent dispute also recently disrupted the sales of Apple Watches in the U.S., and the $3,500 price tag of the new Vision Pro headset will limit its mainstream appeal when it launches in early February.\nConsidering all the challenges Apple faces, its stock doesn't look like a bargain at 28 times forward earnings. And its paltry dividend yield of 0.5% won't attract any serious income investors at a time when CDs and Treasuries offer risk-free yields of more than 5%.\nInstead of wondering when Apple might split its stock again, investors should focus on the company's cash flows and buybacks as it navigates the near-term headwinds. It generated $99.6 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the past 12 months, and it spent $77.6 billion of that total on buybacks and $15 billion on dividends. It bought back 38% of its outstanding shares over the past 10 years, and it has raised its dividend every year since it reinstated the payout in 2012.\nThose moves indicate Apple is a shareholder-friendly company that would rather return its excess cash to its investors instead of \"di-worsifying\" itself with reckless investments or acquisitions. That might be why Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has allocated nearly half of its stock portfolio to Apple.\nBut with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books at the end of its latest quarter, Apple still has plenty of room to make big acquisitions to expand its ecosystem. That cash cushion also makes it a good safe haven stock to own during economic downturns.\nApple's upside might be limited this year, but its core strengths should limit its downside potential until its next growth cycle starts. Therefore, it might still be a good time to accumulate this stock as the bears bemoan its lack of near-term catalysts.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "Apple stock (AAPL) took a hit on Tuesday, falling roughly 1.9%, after TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released a report saying iPhone shipments will decline as much as 15% year over year in 2024. Apple is set to announce its first quarter earnings results after the bell on Thursday.\nAccording to Kuo, who has accurately predicted Apple's moves in the past, a drop in iPhone sales in China coupled with the emergence of generative AI-powered and foldable smartphones will put pressure on iPhone sales throughout the year.\n\"Apple\u2019s weekly shipments in China have declined by 30%\u201340% [year over year] in recent weeks, and this downward trend is expected to continue,\" Kuo wrote in a post on Medium.\n\"The main reason for the decline is the return of Huawei and the fact that foldable phones have gradually become the first choice for high-end users in the Chinese market.\"\nBarclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple\u2019s stock in early January on concerns over iPhone sales in China. Bank of America, however, upgraded Apple's stock, citing its Vision Pro headset and generative AI as future growth catalysts.\nThe downward trend has also cost Apple its spot as the richest publicly traded company by market capitalization. The company is now valued at $2.9 trillion, lower than the new top dog Microsoft, which had a market cap of $3.05 trillion as of Tuesday afternoon.\nApple is in the midst of some of its biggest changes yet, as the company prepares to make significant revisions to its App Store policies in Europe to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act. The iPhone maker says it will begin to open up European consumers' devices to third-party app stores and allow game streaming services like Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming on devices.\nBut critics including Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek say the changes don't go far enough in satisfying their respective antitrust concerns.\nThe Department of Justice is also reportedly considering whether it should file an antitrust lawsuit against Apple related to its App Store practices, according to Bloomberg.\nAll of this comes as Apple prepares to launch the Vision Pro. An AR/VR headset that Apple refers to as a spatial computer, the Vision Pro is the company's first new product category since it debuted the Apple Watch nearly a decade ago.\nThe Vision Pro goes on sale Feb. 2.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "By Noel Randewich\n(Reuters) - A recent dip in Apple's stock over worries about iPhone sales has left the Silicon Valley tech heavyweight in danger of being overtaken by Microsoft as the world's most valuable company.\nFresh worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down 4% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 2% year to date after surging 57% in 2023.\nApple dipped 0.4% on Wednesday, while Microsoft added 1.6%, further eroding the iPhone maker's lead. Apple's stock market value is now at $2.866 trillion, compared to Microsoft's $2.837 trillion value.\nApple's market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, while Microsoft's value reached as much as $2.844 trillion on Nov. 28.\nIPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024, Jefferies analysts said in a client note this week, adding to signs of growing competitive pressures from Huawei and other domestic rivals.\nSales of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple's biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report on Monday estimated that Vision Pro sales would be \"relatively immaterial\" to Apple's earnings per share in 2024.\nA handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.\nBoth tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.\nIn its most recent quarterly report in November, Apple gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand for iPads and wearables.\nAnalysts on average see Apple posting revenue up 0.7% to $117.9 billion for the December quarter, according to LSEG. That would mark its first year-on-year revenue increase in four quarters. Apple reports its results on Feb. 1.\nAnalysts see Microsoft reporting a 16% increase in revenue to $61.1 billion, lifted by ongoing growth in its cloud business when it reports in the coming weeks.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a darling of the markets and a member of the \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d Yet, investors are starting to see the reality of the situation on 2024\u2019s first trading day. I am neutral on AAPL stock, and I would send an urgent message to Apple\u2019s perma-bulls: high-flying stocks generally need to correct or consolidate before the next leg up.\nApple is a world-famous manufacturer of smartphones and other tech gadgets. Apple is also known for various services, including streaming.\nWith a $2.88 trillion market capitalization, Apple is bigger than all other U.S. companies. This might sound bullish, but no company is unstoppable, and no stock can just keep going up without taking a break. This is even true for AAPL stock, which fell today in what might be a bad omen for 2024.\nIf you look up \u201cexhaustion\u201d in the dictionary, you might find a picture of Apple stock\u2019s one-year price chart. I\u2019m joking, of course, but the point is that investing in Apple right now involves serious downside risk.\nFrom a chart perspective, Apple hit major resistance at just below $200 in July and then again in December. In hindsight, AAPL stock really needed to take a breather after its relentless rally in 2023\u2019s first half.\nFurthermore, after gaining around 52% last year, Apple stock appears to have more room below than above. That air pocket below could easily get filled now that Apple\u2019s market cap is so elevated.\nValue-focused investors should be concerned, as Apple\u2019s trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio was nearly 8x before today\u2019s share-price drop. For comparison\u2019s sake, the sector median P/S ratio is slightly above 3x.\nI chose to cite Apple\u2019s P/S ratio because the company\u2019s sales are a topic of discussion today \u2013 but more on that in a moment. First, I wanted to be fair and balanced and acknowledge one analyst\u2019s bullish perspective on Apple.\nAfter AAPL stock\u2019s \u201cmagnificent\u201d rally last year, it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that some analysts are bullish on the stock. Among the most vocal Apple optimists on Wall Street is a well-known analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Apple\u2019s iPhone sales haven\u2019t been stellar in China. There, customers are loyal to China-based smartphone brands, especially Huawei.\nThe market largely overlooked this problem for Apple, and Ives doesn\u2019t seem very concerned about it. The Wedbush analyst seems dismissive of what he calls the \u201cgrowing noise and Huawei competition in China\u201d and the \u201ciPhone China demise narrative,\u201d which Ives called a \u201cgreat fictional story\u201d cooked up by the bears.\nWith that in mind, Ives reiterated his Outperform rating on AAPL stock and published a Street-high $250 price target on the shares. Only time will tell whether Apple can manage to live up to Ives\u2019 confident vision, as the company\u2019s issues in China won\u2019t just go away tomorrow or next week.\nIn stark contrast to Ives and many other Apple bulls, one analyst dared to issue a warning about the company today. It\u2019s a rare event since analysts usually heap praise upon Apple.\nSpecifically, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst\u00a0Tim Long\u00a0downgraded AAPL stock from a Hold to a Sell rating and lowered his price target on the shares from $161 to $160. That\u2019s not a huge price-target reduction, but the Sell rating is getting a lot of coverage in the financial media today.\nLong cited the \u201clackluster\u201d performance of Apple\u2019s iPhone 15, stating, \u201cOur checks remain negative on volumes and mix for iPhone 15, and we see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling.\u201d That\u2019s a powerful warning, as Apple\u2019s smartphones are the company\u2019s bread and butter.\nDon\u2019t expect Apple\u2019s Services business to rescue the company, either. On that topic, Long warned, \u201cWe also believe 2024 will bring more Services risk to light.\u201d\nMoreover \u2013 and here\u2019s the part that I fully agree with \u2013 Long expressed concerns about Apple\u2019s overextended valuation versus the company\u2019s actual results. \u201cThe continued period of weak results coupled with multiple expansion is not sustainable,\u201d Long cautioned.\nOn TipRanks, AAPL comes in as a Moderate Buy based on\u00a023 Buys,\u00a0seven Holds, and\u00a0one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Apple stock price target is $203.04, implying 10.2% upside potential.\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell AAPL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Krish Sankar of TD Cowen, with an average return of 47.31% per rating and a 93% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\nI wouldn\u2019t dare to short Apple shares, as the company is still a technology gadget juggernaut, and expensive stocks can always get more expensive. On the other hand, I\u2019m not prepared to dismiss Apple\u2019s China concerns like Ives seems to be doing.\nPlus, eager investors should take a long, hard look at Apple\u2019s valuation while also heeding Long\u2019s warnings. When all is said and done, Apple is still an important company with strong long-term growth prospects. However, much of Apple\u2019s anticipated growth is probably already priced into AAPL stock, so I\u2019m neutral on it and am not considering a share position now.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock rose 48% in 2023 and helped the S&P 500 index surge back to its 2021 highs in December. The iPhone maker has one of the most loyal customer bases -- and an incredibly strong brand because of it -- but the stock's climb last year is somewhat puzzling, considering the company's recent sales decline.\nWhy are investors bidding the shares higher? Is it safe to buy at these highs? Here's what you need to know.\nSlowing sales growth wouldn't seem to support a stock hitting new highs and trading at a high valuation of 30 times next year's earnings estimates. However, iPhone sales, which make up almost half of Apple's business, hit a new record in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, returning to growth after sales declined for the full fiscal year.\nApple posted a 2.7% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales in fiscal Q4 despite being supply-constrained. The iPhone 15 has lifted the global smartphone market out of a recent sales slump and could be a catalyst for stronger top-line growth over the next year.\nInvestors have banked on the growth in the services business to make the case to buy Apple stock. Services include app sales, subscriptions, and AppleCare warranty plans and the segment generates higher margins than the iPhone and other devices. While services sales were up 16% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, it wasn't enough to drive growth for the entire company, as total sales fell slightly in fiscal 2023.\nNonetheless, there is a reason Warren Buffett continues to make Apple Berkshire Hathaway's largest stock holding, a stake worth over $156 billion as of Sept. 30.\nDespite other smartphones that beat Apple with innovative features, Apple continues to grow its base of active devices and generate loads of cash to fund investments in artificial intelligence and other features to maintain high customer satisfaction scores.\nApple's iOS mobile operating system trails Alphabet's Android in market share. Android consistently commands over 80% share of the mobile market, according to Counterpoint Research. But Apple commanded half of the smartphone market's total sales. Most impressive is that Apple generates a high percentage of the smartphone market's operating profit.\nApple's brand helps the company price its products to earn higher profits than its competitors -- a key competitive advantage and why the stock deserves to trade at a high valuation. Apple generated $99 billion in free cash flow on $383 billion of total sales in fiscal 2023.\nThe Oracle of Omaha loves to make big bets on companies with strong brands, especially if those brands can produce high margins and keep growing over the long term. Apple possesses these qualities in spades.\nApple stock isn't going to appreciate by 48% every year, but the blue chip stock can deliver solid returns over many years.\u00a0\"Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem,\" CFO Luca Maestri said on the fiscal Q4 earnings call.\nBecause Apple has such a low share of unit sales in the smartphone market, the company has ample opportunity to grow iPhone sales over the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

After a Wednesday sell-off, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pushed for gains at points in the session, but fell nearly 0.6% below the flatline by the close.\nInvestors looking for confirmation of bets on a March rate cut got uncertainty instead in the Fed minutes released Wednesday. While officials agreed rates had reached a peak and should be lower by the end of 2024, some signaled that they could stay at their historically high levels \"for some time\" depending on the path of inflation.\nIn single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) stock stumbled for a fourth straight day as Wall Street highlighted concerns about weakening iPhone demand.\nRead more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nMultiple data points released Thursday morning showed the labor market remains intact while wages continue to cool, a welcome sign in the fight against inflation.\nThe latest ADP employment report showed private companies added 164,000 jobs in the month of December, above November's reading of 103,000 and higher than analysts' expectations for 115,000 additions.\nElsewhere, the Department of Labor reported that 202,000 jobless claims were filed last week, below economist estimates for 216,000.\nMeanwhile, US bond yields returned to gains, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) edging closer to 4% after falling away from that level on Wednesday.\nInvestors will now turn to the December jobs report. The monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 175,000 in December while the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.8% from the previous month, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe stock market's slide to kick off 2024 continued on Thursday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed just above the flatline, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.3%. After a Wednesday sell-off, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pushed for gains at points in the session, but fell nearly 0.6% below the flatline by the close.\nMeanwhile, tech stalwart Apple (AAPL) stock stumbled for a fourth-straight day as Wall Street's highlighted concerns about weakening iPhone demand. The big tech giant is now down almost 6% in the last five days.\nQuantumScape Corporation (QS) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Thursday. Shares of the Volkswagen's battery subsidiary soared almost 50% after its solid-state cell passed its first endurance test. \nMobileye Global (MBLY) stock dropped roughly 25% after the chipmaker announced it expects first quarter revenue to be down abut 50%.

Cruise line operators Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Carnival (CCL) surged more than 2%.\nOil futures fell more than 2% earlier in the session amid higher-than-expected builds of US gasoline and distillate fuels.\nMeanwhile, energy-related stocks were under pressure on Thursday. The S&P 500 Energy Select ETF (XLE) was the worst-performing sector, down more than 1%.\nThe December jobs report is set for release Friday morning and is expected to show further signs of a cooling labor market to finish 2023.\nThe monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 175,000 in December while the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.8% from the previous month, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. In November, the US economy added 199,000 jobs while unemployment unexpectedly fell to 3.7%.\nHere are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at, according to data from Bloomberg:\nOnce again, the report will be a crucial test for the stock market's end-of-year rally. Investors have largely attributed the move that pushed stocks near all-time highs to a shift in sentiment as many now believe the Federal Reserve can achieve a so-called soft landing, where inflation retreats to 2% without a complete downturn in economic growth.\n\"We expect the December employment report to show slower job growth and a further moderation in nominal wage growth, both something the Federal Reserve wants to see as it attempts to engineer a soft-landing,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in note on Thursday.\nOil prices reversed course on Thursday after weekly US gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles pointed to lower demand.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% before paring most of those losses following the release of US crude inventory data. Brent (BZ=F) also sank into negative territory, losing its earlier gains.\nGasoline stockpiles rose by 10.9 million barrels, their highest week-over-week increase in more than three decades, according to Energy Information Administration data.\nCrude inventories fell by 5.5 million barrels for the week ending Dec. 29, but the bigger-than-expected draw may reflect supplies from the US making up for shipment interruptions stemming from Red Sea tensions.\nOil futures were up more than 1% earlier in the session, extending their gains from Wednesday amid concerns of supply interruptions in Libya.\nA precipitous fall in mortgage rates has stalled to start 2024.\nYahoo Finance's Rebeca Chen reports:\nThe average rates for 30-year loans inched up to 6.62% from 6.61% a week ago, according to tracking by Freddie Mac on Thursday. Aside from this week's minuscule rise, rates have been declining for weeks since late October, falling nearly 117 basis points from a 12-month high of 7.79% at the end of October.\nThose recent declines have boosted homebuyers' ability to purchase homes, but further affordability improvement could be curbed by a continual supply shortage, especially if lower rates bring back sidelined demand.\n\"While mortgage interest rates are expected to overall decline in 2024, minor fluctuations in weekly mortgage interest rates are to be expected,\" Jessica Lautz,the National Association of Realtors\u2019 deputy chief economist, wrote to Yahoo Finance.\n\"The biggest demand is likely to come from those who had been priced out of the homebuying market. For spring, there will likely be competition among the steady share of all-cash homebuyers and first-time buyers trying to edge in,\" Lautz added.\nStocks are off to a rough start in 2024.\nThe famed Santa Claus Rally didn't come. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) had its fourth-worst first day of a new year ever. And the Russell 2000 (^RUT), a darling of the recent market rally, just had its third-worst two-day start to a year ever.\n\"It's fair to say that financial markets have started 2024 with something of a mild hangover,\" Capital Economics deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann wrote in a research note Wednesday.\nBut some on Wall Street think the current drivers of the market have been macro-focused. When that sentiment shifts to focus on earnings, the rally can continue.\nRecent data from FactSet shows analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report earnings growth of 11.7% for the full year, which would be above the 10-year average annual earnings growth rate of 8.4%.\nThat earnings backdrop is one of the main drivers behind Bank of America seeing nearly 10% growth for the S&P 500 from current levels, per BofA equity strategist Ohsung Kwon.\n\"Earnings season, starting next week, is going to be key to the market,\" Kwon said.\nWith companies officially exiting the earnings recession in the third quarter, Kwon believes that momentum continuing is crucial to the bullish thesis.\n\"Companies have cut costs throughout the earnings recession,\" Kwon said. \"They have managed margins. Margins went up for the second straight quarter. So I think the momentum is to the upside and if companies talk more positively this earnings season, given that the rate pressure and the macro uncertainty has eased somewhat. Now, that's going to be bullish for equities.\"\nUS stocks stalled on Thursday, struggling to shake off a dismal start to the year after Federal Reserve policymakers left hopes for an early interest-rate cut hanging.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.1%. Tech stocks signaled a return to their Wednesday sell-off, as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped about 0.4%.\nMultiple data points released Thursday morning showed the labor market remains intact while wages continue to cool, a welcome sign in the fight against inflation.\nThe latest ADP employment report showed private companies added 164,000 jobs in the month of December, above November's reading of 103,000 and higher than analyst expectations for 115,000 additions.\nAlso within the release, ADP revealed annual wage growth fell to 5.4% from 5.6% the month prior.\n\"We're returning to a labor market that's very much aligned with pre-pandemic hiring,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \"While wages didn't drive the recent bout of inflation, now that pay growth has retreated, any risk of a wage-price spiral has all but disappeared.\"\nElsewhere, data from the Department of Labor shows 202,000 jobless claims were filed last week, below economist estimates for 216,000. Jobless claims are an area several economists have told Yahoo Finance they're monitoring for signs of a slowdown, as an uptick in claims would mean more people are being laid off from their jobs.\nThe big labor data update for the week still awaits investors as the December jobs report is expected for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nApple (AAPL) was hit with its second downgrade in the four days of 2024, this time from Piper Sandler.\nThe reason for the downgrade from analyst Harsh Kumar was similar to the one from peers at Barclays earlier this week: iPhone demand, especially in an expectedly weak Chinese market.\nApple's stock has already been hit this year, and it was down more than 1% in premarket trading on Thursday:\nPiper Sandler's downgrade to Neutral from Overweight was perhaps less jarring than that of Barclays, which cut its rating to Underweight on Tuesday. Apple's stock responded with its biggest percentage drop since September.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the percentage of analysts with a bullish rating on the stock is at a three-year low.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1.The company expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, net sales declined 5.5% year over year to $117.15 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $117.62 billion, indicating growth of 0.40% year over year.The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.09 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating an 11.17% increase from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Apple\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, missing once, the earnings surprise being 3.47% on average.\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\nApple\u2019s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.9% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales decreased 0.7% year over year to $43.805 billion.Apple expects iPhone\u2019s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis. Our model estimates for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $66.68 billion, up 1.4% year over year.Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 72.3 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple\u2019s market share was 24% in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023, beating Samsung\u2019s 17%, driven by new iPhone launches - iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.However, iPhone sales are expected to have suffered from weak demand in the Chinese market due to lower demand amid stiff competition from Huawei and a ban on usage by government officials.\nFor the fiscal first quarter, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter.In the fiscal fourth quarter, Services revenues grew 16.3% from the year-ago quarter to $22.31 billion and accounted for 24.9% of sales.An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices.Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.Apple TV+ has been gaining recognition due to its strong content. Apple\u2019s impressive run at the award shows has been instrumental in driving recognition of Apple TV+ in the saturated streaming market currently dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN Prime Video, Netflix NFLX and Disney\u2019s DIS Disney+.Consumption of Apple TV+ doubled in 2023, per a report from Deadline cited by 9TO5 Mac. Total viewership surged 42% year over year.Movies and shows like The Family Plan, The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry, Messi Meets America, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Silo, Hijack, Bad Sisters and Ted Lasso drove consumption.However, higher viewership has not essentially turned into a market share leadership for Apple TV+. According to 9TO5Mac, which cited a JustWatch report, Amazon Prime Video was #1 in terms of market share (22%) in the United States, trailed by Netflix (21%). Max, Disney+ and Hulu had 15%,12% and 11% market share, respectively. Apple TV+\u2019s market share increased from 6% to 7%.Our estimate for fiscal first-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $22.65 billion, indicating 9.1% year-over-year growth.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Author": "  Will Daniel ",
        "Text": "After surging roughly 50% to a record high in 2023, a rare rating downgrade from Wall Street helped push Apple stock down 3.65% on Tuesday, shaving over $100 billion from the tech giant\u2019s market cap.\nBarclays analyst Tim Long tagged Apple with an \u201cunderweight\u201d rating due to weak iPhone demand Tuesday morning, arguing its shares could sink roughly 13% to $160 over the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s rare to see any analyst hit America\u2019s highest-valued company with a negative rating. Apple is rated at hold or better by 40 out of 44 Wall Street forecasters, according to data provided to the Wall Street Journal by FactSet. But Long said that iPhone 15 sales have been \u201clackluster\u201d\u2014particularly in China, which has reportedly banned government officials from using Apple\u2019s flagship product due to security concerns. He also expects sales of the iPhone 16, which is set to be released in September, to be weaker than expected. \u201cWe see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,\u201d he wrote.\nWhile Barclays\u2019 downgrade may have sparked Apple\u2019s stock price drop Tuesday, there are several other factors putting the company under pressure. For one, after Apple shares jumped nearly 50% last year, investors might be reallocating some capital away from the company in the new year. \u201cThe new year brings tax-motivated postponed gain-taking and repositioning by portfolio managers,\u201d Louis Navellier, founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, told Bloomberg Tuesday.\nApple\u2019s decline also coincides with wider weakness in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. The index sank 1.6% on Tuesday, with investors digesting the potential impact of rising geopolitical tensions amid the Israel-Hamas war and Houthi rebel attacks on ships carrying freight in the Red Sea, a critical trade route. Surging oil prices and broken supply chains because of conflict in the Middle East could lead inflation to be stickier than previously anticipated, which might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high, weighing on growth-focused tech stocks.\nThere have also been warning signs about waning iPhone demand for some time\u2014and that\u2019s critical given that iPhone sales made up nearly 50% of Apple\u2019s total revenue in the third quarter of 2023.\nUBS analyst David Vogt, who holds a neutral rating and $190 price target for Apple, warned in a Monday note that iPhone 15 sales have been \u201csoft\u201d in many key regions lately, including China and India.\nVogt explained that U.S. iPhone sales to end customers (called sell-through) fell almost 13% from a year ago in November, while China sales were down 6% over the same period. This led Apple to lose 50 basis points of global smartphone market share year over year in November, and 320 basis points of smartphone market share in China over the same period. \u201cNew competition is a challenge,\u201d Vogt said of the data.\nRegulatory challenges to Apple\u2019s app store in the U.S. and EU are also weighing on investor sentiment. Apple\u2019s $85 billion services business could face pressure due to a U.S. antitrust trial that revealed, among other things, Google pays tens of billions a year to maintain its standing as the default search engine on Apple\u2019s devices.\n\u201cIn 2024\u2026some app store investigations could intensify,\u201d Long wrote Monday, noting that the U.S. court\u2019s decision over Google\u2019s payments to Apple will come later this year.\nAs Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told the Financial Times last week, investors may have been ignoring antitrust risks in recent years, but as a number of high-profile cases wind their way through the courts, antitrust is no longer just \u201cnoise in the background.\u201d\n\u201cI think investors should take it seriously,\u201d he warned.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": " Hamza Shaban    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "The brightest light on Wall Street is dimmer at the start of 2024.\nApple (AAPL), the most valuable company on the market, has endured a bruising run in the first days of the new year. The iPhone maker, which commands about 7% of the weight of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index, steering the fate of investor portfolios, drew two stock downgrades this week, pulling shares down more than 5% and raising concerns about weakening iPhone demand.\nBarclays struck the first blow. Analysts there cut Apple's rating to Underweight and dropped their price target to $160, representing what was a roughly 17% stock price drop for the tech giant from last year.\n\"We rate Apple Under Weight as questions persist about the deterioration of iPhone upgrade demand with rising competition in the premium smartphone segment,\" the analysts wrote.\nThe follow-up punch landed Thursday, when analysts at Piper Sandler downgraded their rating on Apple's stock to Neutral from Overweight and sliced their price target by $15 to $205. Apple shares were trading hands at around $182 as of Thursday afternoon.\n\"We are concerned about handset inventories entering into 1H24 and also feel that growth rates have peaked for unit sales,\" said lead analyst Harsh Kumar in a note to clients. \"Deteriorating macro environment in China could also weigh on handset business.\"\nThe percentage of analysts with a bullish rating on the stock is at a three-year low, according to Bloomberg data.\nApple's iPhone revenue sank about $5 billion in 2023 from the year prior. The flagship iPhone accounts for roughly half the company\u2019s total revenue. Sales of Macs, iPads, and wearables also declined, as rising inflation and interest rates pressured consumers.\nBut bullish analysts focus on Apple's growing services businesses, which swelled from $78 billion in 2022 to $85 billion in 2023. In the most recent quarter revenue from services ballooned by almost 20% compared to the same period the year before. Apple's enormous user base and the strength of its services are a crucial component of more optimistic readings on the company's future. Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives pin the value of Apple's services business as high as $1.6 trillion and predict that Cupertino will become the first $4 trillion company by the end of 2024.\nSkeptical observers, however, see heightened risks even in Apple's most promising segment. Barclays noted that services might attract more regulatory scrutiny. Investigations into the app store could intensify, especially as other tech giants brace for a wave of significant antitrust rulings this year. How Big Tech figures into the US presidential election and how aggressively the next administration will pursue competition enforcement is another major factor for tech stocks.\nApple's lucrative agreement to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser, which is estimated to bring in billions of dollars to its services business, could also be under threat. Closing arguments for the Department of Justice's antitrust case against the search giant are scheduled for the spring.\nApple's dimming prospects among some analysts coincide with a stock performance that lags behind other members of the Magnificent Seven.\nAll the names in the elite, tech-centric group handily beat out the benchmark S&P 500 index. But Apple claimed the lowest position, rising roughly 50% in 2023. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, but is notable compared to the staggering gains of Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META), up 239% and 194%, respectively, or even Microsoft's (MSFT) more modest 57% rise. The Nasdaq 100's (^NDX) increase of 54% managed to edge out Apple too.\nWhere much of the tech world and even players outside it have scrambled to get in on the AI hype \u2014 releasing products, announcing new ventures or simply reciting the words \"AI\" \u2014 Apple CEO Tim Cook has taken a more subtle approach. That too may have played a factor in the market's cooling reception.\nIn recent earnings calls, Cook has explained that AI is already integrated into the Apple consumer experience. It's just that the company doesn't call out the technologies explicitly, as if it were a marketing gimmick, but relies instead on weaving AI into its products and focusing on the customer benefit. In another rhetorical move that appeared to be gently critical of other tech leaders, Cook said the company tends to unveil new technologies when they are ready for users. And not before.\nIf there is a consumer tech company defined by how its products make users feel \u2014 for the vibes rather than the intricacies of its software, it's Apple. So not showboating about what's coming in the AI development cycle has its benefits.\nBut a more pessimistic interpretation is that as rivals like Microsoft and Meta lean into their large language models, framing generative AI as tech's next great frontier, Apple is getting left behind. And most of us already have phones.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "Apple Stock: Time to Buy the Dip?",
        "Author": "  Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Following a great 2023 for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, which soared 48% higher, the stock is taking a breather so far in 2024. Year to date, shares are down more than 3%. Is this an opportunity to buy shares of the iPhone maker, or is the stock's decline justified?\nTo explore whether or not shares are attractive today, let's look at both the bear and bull cases for the tech stock.\nThe bear case for Apple (the case against owning the stock) can be summarized in two points:\nThe tech company has struggled to grow revenue recently and its stock's valuation has become borderline frothy.\nThis has some investors worried that the company may not meet the high expectations currently baked into the stock price.\nRegarding the Cupertino-based company's growth, fiscal 2023 revenue fell nearly 3% year over year. Further, earnings per share barely budged, coming in at $6.13 for the period -- up from $6.11 in the year-ago quarter. A pullback in iPhone sales and a dramatic decline in Mac sales weighed on the year's results. Foreign exchange headwinds were also a major factor pulling down revenue and earnings.\nAlso raising some eyebrows is the stock's valuation. Over the last year, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio has gone from 22 to more than 30. Viewed another way, the company has a $2.9 trillion market capitalization despite annual earnings only coming in at $97 billion.\nThis high valuation bakes in robust earnings-per-share growth for years to come. More specifically, a valuation at this level demands average annual earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digits over the next decade and, more importantly, continued market dominance in lucrative segments like its iPhone and services businesses.\nBut don't count Apple out. The bull case (the case for owning the stock) highlights several reasons the company could deliver strong earnings growth in the coming years.\nFirst, there's Apple's fast-growing services segment. This segment, which includes revenue from services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, AppleCare, and revenue share from third-party applications in the App Store, grew 16% year over year in Apple's most recent fiscal quarter. Further, management said the company expects similar growth, when adjusted to exclude revenue from the extra week in the year-ago period, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nLonger term, there's good reason to expect Apple's momentum in services to persist. The tailwinds for the segment are numerous, including a nascent but meaningful advertising business, Apple's ability to bring new services to market over time, and rapid growth in third-party app subscriptions.\nAnother reason to be bullish on Apple stock is its strong balance sheet combined with management's excellent track record of good capital allocation. The company ended fiscal Q4 with a net cash and marketable securities position of $51 billion. With a goal to become cash neutral (the point at which total cash and marketable securities equals total debt) over time, Apple has been steadily repurchasing its shares and paying dividends. Further, Apple has a history of opportunistically buying back more stock when shares appear cheaper. This prudent approach to repurchases makes every dollar go further than if the company purchased the same amount of shares every quarter no matter where the stock traded.\nOf course, with annual free cash flow of nearly $100 billion, it's going to take some time for Apple to become net cash neutral. So, investors can expect the company to repurchase shares in substantial sums and pay meaningful dividends for the foreseeable future.\nCombining these positive developments (a fast-growing services segment and prudent capital allocation backed by a healthy balance sheet) with the company's loyal customer base and Apple's long history of innovation, the tech stock arguably deserves to trade at a premium valuation. While it may not make sense to be an aggressive buyer of Apple stock at this valuation, it may make sense for investors without exposure to the stock to start a small position following its recent dip.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "It might be tempting for investors to rule out many \"big tech\" companies as good investments in 2024. After all, a handful of the world's biggest tech companies were a key driver to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's monstrous 43% gain last year. Indeed, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and Alphabet rose 48%, 57%, and 58%, respectively, in 2023. But the reality is that these companies likely deserve their current valuation. Going further, all three of these stocks may actually be compelling investments today.\nTo this end, one analyst recently took a surprisingly bullish stance on one of these three juggernauts: Apple. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in late December that he expects the iPhone maker to command a $4 trillion market capitalization and a price of $250 by the end of 2024.\nLet's take a look at why this analyst is so bullish on Apple stock and consider whether or not he is onto something.\nIves, who calls Apple stock a \"top tech pick,\" believes the tech company will show off its resilience in 2024 with an iPhone business returning to growth by continuing its strong service momentum.\nThough Apple's total sales in fiscal 2023 fell compared to the prior fiscal year, trends improved throughout the year. Indeed, Apple's iPhone business actually returned to revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter; total iPhone revenue for the period was $43.8 billion, up from $42.6 billion in the year-ago period. With the segment accounting for more than half of Apple's annual sales, a return to growth in iPhone revenue is good news for shareholders.\n\"iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook in the company's fiscal Q4 earnings call, \"setting a September quarter record as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China Mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and an all-time record in India.\"\nBetter yet, Apple CEO Luca Maestri said the company expects growth from the iPhone again in fiscal Q1 -- the company's biggest seasonal quarter for the year since it includes the holidays.\nAdditionally, Apple's thriving services segment grew 16% year over year in fiscal Q4 despite continued macroeconomic challenges in some areas of the segment. Maestri said he expects momentum from the lucrative segment to persist in fiscal Q1.\nBut are these catalysts enough to justify the stock's valuation of about 30 times earnings today? When viewed alongside bull cases for the stock, like the company's long track record of good capital-allocation decisions, a $51 billion net-cash position, and the optionality for new potential product lines over the next decade, I think the answer is yes.\nWith Apple shares falling several percentage points on the first trading day of the year, it may be a good time to buy shares of one of the most resilient tech companies in the world. Could shares rise to $250 by the end of the year like Ives thinks they will? It's possible. But investors who buy shares shouldn't be looking for a quick fix. As always, investors who buy stocks should have long time horizons -- typically, five years or more. Over this horizon, Apple stock looks poised to do well.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Chris Morris ",
        "Text": "Since its debut in 2010, the iPad has regularly received annual updates and enhancements. That streak came to an end in 2023, however.\nFor the first time since it introduced its tablet, Apple did not roll out a new model last year. The last time the company updated the line was in October 2022.\nThat drought is expected to end later this year, with the rumor mill suggesting a refresh on the entire product line, from entry-level iPads to a new flagship iPad Pro, which is expected to receive several new features, ranging from a better screen to a new keyboard attachment.\nThe new iPads could be introduced as early as March.\nPart of the reason for the interruption in new iPads, per Bloomberg, was Apple\u2019s desire to make it easier for consumers to differentiate between models. The wide variety of models has resulted in a sales slowdown for the iPad. In fiscal 2023, sales of the tablet were down 3% compared to fiscal 2022. The year before, they saw an 8% decline.\nThe pause in new iPads also comes as Apple is working to add touch screens to its Mac computers, a decision that cofounder Steve Jobs once rejected and one the company previously worried could cannibalize iPad sales.\nThe company is also facing issues with its successful Apple Watch line, which is in the midst of a legal battle over a patent infringement battle with Masimo. An import ban went into effect late last year but was quickly paused by an appeals court.\nApple could use some good news. On the first day of trading in 2024, the company\u2019s stock was down more than 3% in late morning trading. That followed a downgrade from Barclays, which cited a slowdown in iPhone sales, particularly in China. The drop wiped out over $100 billion of Apple\u2019s market value.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) Could Impress as Vision Pro Launch Looms",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock may continue to be a tug of war between the bulls and the bears over the near term. Though you could build a pretty strong bullish or bearish case for the $3 trillion (or so) tech titan, I\u2019d argue that fortune favors the bulls as the Vision Pro launch looms. Undoubtedly, the Apple Vision Pro officially goes on the market on February 2, and the reviews across the web are sure to be hot topics as many critics look to give their take on Apple\u2019s first new product class in years.\nThe Vision Pro is a product that holds quite a bit of potential, but I believe its potential is being dismissed by the bears who may be missing the trees for the woods.\nUndoubtedly, the Vision Pro represents a giant leap in the field of spatial computing (or mixed reality, if you prefer). And though it won\u2019t nudge earnings higher by all too much (it represents a drop in the bucket as far as 2024 is concerned), I do think those looking out to the next three to five years stand to be impressed by what the Vision Pro ultimately evolves to become.\nGiven this, I can\u2019t help but remain bullish on AAPL stock ahead of the Vision Pro\u2019s launch day.\nYou see, Apple plays the long-term game, and when it launches a new product, it\u2019s looking at building profits, not just in the short term but over many years. The Apple App Store wasn\u2019t populated with must-have apps overnight. It took years before the many must-have apps we know and love came to be.\nThe same thing can be said for Apple\u2019s Vision Pro App Store. The developers need time, but they will begin to populate it with intriguing spatial computing apps that may draw in more crowds to pick up the latest iteration of Vision Pro.\nFor now, I\u2019d look for the Vision Pro launch to be similar to that of the first Apple Watch, which was released just shy of a decade ago. Initially, many people scoffed at the idea of a smartwatch, given its fairly limited features.\nNowadays, you see Apple Watches on a broad range of different people, including those who aren\u2019t exactly fitness buffs. From the smartwatch\u2019s life-saving capabilities to its use as a status symbol \u2014 think the Apple Watch Ultra, which is an intriguing buy, even for those who don\u2019t partake in \u201cextreme\u201d sports, deep-sea diving, or hardcore hiking \u2014 in the office, it\u2019s clear that the Apple Watch needed a few years to warm up with consumers.\nThe same goes with the Vision Pro. It\u2019s going to take time before it makes a dent in the overall product sales mix. However, it\u2019s a mistake to overlook the technology just because a bearish analyst doesn\u2019t view it as material over the near term.\nOf course, the bearish analysts are right. The Vision Pro won\u2019t magically propel earnings growth higher for the next quarter or even the quarter after that. If you\u2019re a long-term investor focused on the next 10 years, however, I\u2019d argue that Vision Pro is a big deal and should not be ignored at the cost of products that are more meaningful to the results in the present.\nFurther, Vision Pro hype alone may be able to nudge the stock higher from here if the early reviews are favorable and early demand stays hot. Thus far, pre-orders have been hot, with some pundits believing the company sold as many as 180,000 during the pre-order weekend.\nSo, if you look to the past, you\u2019ll probably see that iPhone sales growth is not where it needs to be to justify the stock\u2019s current 31.68 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. A multiple like this calls for double-digit growth, perhaps even high double-digit growth.\nWill Apple be able to command that through iPhone, Mac, and services alone? Possibly, assuming the economy picks up traction again in 2024. But there\u2019s no question Apple could use a new product to do more of the heavy lifting over the coming years.\nAs the Vision Pro gets smarter and richer with experiences (wait for that Vision Pro App Store to populate, folks), lighter, more comfortable, and more affordable, you can bet that more Apple users are going to want to make the big purchase.\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 32 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target\u00a0is $203.52, implying upside potential of 4.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.\nWhether the average person starts dawning spatial computers in public two years from now or more than five years from now, I believe AAPL stock could have a lot to gain into the back half of this year as we finally get our hands on a Vision Pro. It\u2019s a product that could give us a glimpse of the future \u2014 one that could be profoundly prosperous for Apple.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Quarterly Revenue: $119.6 billion, a 2% increase year over year.\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $2.18, marking a 16% rise from the previous year.\nServices Revenue: Reached a new all-time high of $23.1 billion.\nOperating Cash Flow: Nearly $40 billion generated in the quarter.\nDividend: Declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share.\nActive Devices: Installed base surpassed 2.2 billion, an all-time high.\nOn February 1, 2024, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its 8-K filing, announcing financial results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter ended December 30, 2023. The tech giant reported a modest revenue increase to $119.6 billion, up 2% from the same quarter last year. Notably, earnings per diluted share surged by 16% to a new all-time high of $2.18.\nApple, a leading innovator in personal technology, continues to dominate with its suite of products and services. With the iPhone as its flagship product, Apple has built an expansive ecosystem that includes the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, all complemented by a growing range of services like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. The company's commitment to innovation is evident in its latest offering, the Apple Vision Pro, which CEO Tim Cook suggests will continue Apple's tradition of groundbreaking advancements.\nApple's financial achievements this quarter reflect the company's robust business model and its ability to grow its services segment to new heights. The increase in services revenue to $23.1 billion underscores the company's successful diversification beyond hardware sales. However, the modest growth in overall revenue indicates potential challenges in expanding its market share and finding new revenue streams, especially in a competitive and rapidly changing technology landscape.\nApple's income statement reveals a gross margin increase to $54.9 billion, up from $50.3 billion in the previous year, indicating improved profitability. Operating expenses saw a slight rise, but the company managed to expand its operating income to $40.4 billion. The balance sheet shows a healthy cash and cash equivalents position of $40.8 billion, an increase from $29.9 billion at the end of the previous quarter, which demonstrates Apple's strong liquidity position.\n\"Our December quarter top-line performance combined with margin expansion drove an all-time record EPS of $2.18, up 16 percent from last year,\" said Luca Maestri, Apples CFO. \"During the quarter, we generated nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow, and returned almost $27 billion to our shareholders. We are confident in our future, and continue to make significant investments across our business to support our long-term growth plans.\"\nApple's financial tables highlight key data points:\nFinancial Metrics\nQ1 2024\nQ1 2023\nNet Sales (Products)\n$96.5 billion\n$96.4 billion\nNet Sales (Services)\n$23.1 billion\n$20.8 billion\nTotal Net Sales\n$119.6 billion\n$117.2 billion\nGross Margin\n$54.9 billion\n$50.3 billion\nNet Income\n$33.9 billion\n$30.0 billion\nApple's performance this quarter demonstrates its ability to maintain profitability and reward shareholders amidst global economic uncertainties. The significant increase in EPS is a testament to the company's operational efficiency and cost management. The growth in the services sector is particularly noteworthy, as it represents Apple's strategic shift towards less hardware-dependent revenue streams. However, the relatively flat product sales suggest that Apple may need to continue innovating and diversifying its product line to sustain growth in the highly competitive tech market.\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a formidable player in the technology sector, with a strong financial foundation and a clear strategic direction aimed at long-term growth. Investors and stakeholders can take confidence in Apple's consistent performance and its ability to adapt to market changes.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Apple Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell 3.6% at the close of trading in New York on Tuesday, the stock's steepest drop since August. The moves came after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker and lowered its price target for shares of the company on fears of slowing iPhone 15 sales in China.\n\u201cWe are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables,\u201d Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\u201cThe biggest takeaway from the latest checks is incrementally worse [iPhone 15] data points out of China, together with developed markets remaining soft,\u201d he added.\nAccording to Long, the softness in iPhone sales is likely to continue even after Apple launches the iPhone 16 later this year, as the phone isn\u2019t expected to have many major upgrades over the current model.\nApple\u2019s iPhone revenue declined roughly $5 billion in 2023 versus 2022. Sales of the company\u2019s Macs, iPads, and wearables were also off, as consumers felt pressure from rising inflation and interest rates. The PC industry was also stung as fewer consumers needed to purchase new systems after millions bought up laptops and desktops at the start of the pandemic.\nLong also called out Apple\u2019s services business as a potential weak link for the company, saying that the segment faces a number of battles ahead including those related to its App Store practices. Apple is facing pressure to allow app developers to offer users a means of paying for apps via third-party payment options that would cut out Apple\u2019s 30% App Store fee.\nThe company\u2019s deal to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser could also be under threat as the Department of Justice continues its antitrust case against the search giant. Apple is estimated to rake in billions on the deal, which is reported under the services business.\nApple\u2019s service business, on the other hand, jumped from $78.1 billion in 2022 to $85.2 billion in 2023. Long, however, says that the segment will start to see growth slow in the coming years.\n\u201cWe model ~10% and ~8% growth in services in FY24 and FY25, well below [the] prior growth estimate of ~20%. In 2024, we should get an initial determination on the Google TAC, and some app store investigations could intensify,\u201d Long wrote.\nAt the same time, Apple is continuing to fight its patent battle with medical device maker Masimo over whether the Apple Watch\u2019s blood oxygen sensor infringes on Masimo\u2019s patents related to the technology.\nApple initially pulled its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from store shelves ahead of Christmas after the International Trade Commission called for a ban on imports of the watches. But a federal appeals court ruled Apple could continue selling the watches while the dispute works its way through the court system.\nDespite those potential troubles, Apple has a major bright spot on the horizon: its Vision Pro headset. Apple is expected to host a launch event for the AR/VR headset sometime in February. And if the Vision Pro, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is a success, it could set up Apple as the go-to company for a new generation of computing devices.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Apple Overhauls App Store, iPhone Features in EU to Appease Regulators",
        "Author": "  Samuel Stolton and Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is embarking on a historic overhaul of its iOS, Safari and App Store offerings in the European Union, aiming to placate regulators set to impose tough new antitrust rules.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain\nTraders Line Up for \u2018Once-in-a-Generation\u2019 Emerging Markets Bet\nUPS to Cut 12,000 Jobs, Bring Workers in Five Days a Week\nBlackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers\nStocks Flounder With Tech Earnings Test in Sight: Markets Wrap\nThe revamp will allow customers to download software from outside the App Store for the first time, the company said Thursday. They\u2019ll also be able to use alternative payment systems and more easily choose a new default web browser \u2014 addressing two frequent complaints of developers and lawmakers.\nThe sweeping changes \u2014 coming in March as part of Apple\u2019s iOS 17.4 operating system \u2014 is a direct response to the EU\u2019s new Digital Markets Act, which imposes rigid restrictions on the largest tech firms and boosts the EU commission\u2019s powers as the region\u2019s antitrust enforcer. Still, Apple is mounting a legal challenge against the regulations through the EU courts.\nThe announcement is a big moment for both Apple and the EU. The closed design of the App Store was a founding principle of the technology \u2014 aimed at ensuring security, safeguarding the user experience and boosting revenue. For the EU, Apple\u2019s changes are the biggest test yet of whether it can force meaningful reforms in how the world\u2019s largest tech companies operate.\nThe announcement jarred investors, who sent the shares negative after earlier gains. As of 2:08 p.m. in New York, the stock was down less than 1% at $193.83.\nApple executives cautioned on Thursday that the changes do threaten to undercut the company\u2019s long-held emphasis on user security.\n\u201cApple is having to create technology to allow an app to install other apps, and inherent in that is risk,\u201d Phil Schiller, a longtime Apple marketing chief who now runs the App Store, said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThat could be a big threat vector for the privacy, security and integrity of your device. So Apple is putting in place technologies and policies to try and minimize that risk.\u201d\nSchiller added that in a big year for elections worldwide \u2014 with the associated threats of malware and malicious technologies circulating \u2014 there may be \u201cnew risks for users\u201d from downloading apps from alternative app marketplaces that don\u2019t share Apple\u2019s security standards. The company will not extend its content-related guidelines to a third-party marketplace.\nAs part of the overhaul, developers will be able to create tap-to-pay apps using the iPhone\u2019s payment chip, as well as browsers with third-party engines and extensive game streaming services. They\u2019ll also be able to request deeper access to iPhone hardware and software features.\nThe new approach jettisons the up-to-30% commission that Apple has imposed on developers since its App Store launched in 2008. They\u2019ll now pay the company a cut of 17% on app sales, and that declines to 10% for most developers and subscriptions after their first year. The company isn\u2019t changing its commission structure outside of the EU.\nStill, there are new costs for software makers. The company has introduced two additional fees: a 3% payment processing charge for apps that use Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system, and a \u20ac0.50 fee per app install \u2014 via Apple\u2019s store or third-party marketplaces \u2014 for software installed more than 1 million times in a 12-month period.\nMore than 99% of developers in the EU will see their payments to Apple decrease or stay the same, and fewer than 1% will need to pay the app install fee, the company said. The move also means that apps sold outside the App Store won\u2019t require any commission beyond the \u20ac0.50 fee.\nThe shift could hurt Apple\u2019s services revenue, a key area of growth for the tech giant in recent years. That category now accounts for more than 20% of the company\u2019s sales, up from less than 10% a decade ago.\nApple\u2019s in-app purchase system won\u2019t apply to software downloaded outside the App Store \u2014 a process known as sideloading. When developers distribute their software in that way, the only fee to Apple is the \u20ac0.50. But the apps will still need to be notarized and checked by Apple for security threats, the company said.\nAdditional adjustments include new developer tools for third parties to create their own app download stores and web browsers without using WebKit \u2014 the standard Apple has required since the beginning of the App Store.\nThird-party app stores will only be able to be installed from a developer\u2019s website. Several software makers have already said they intend to launch their own stores to take advantage of the changes.\nFor the first time, banks and other financial services will be able to compete with Apple Pay on the iPhone and create tap-to-pay apps. Apple customers can set up a third-party payment app or app store as their default choice in their settings as well. In another concession, users will be prompted to choose a default web browser the first time they open Apple\u2019s Safari on iOS 17.4.\nBloomberg News reported on Apple\u2019s plans in December 2022.\nApple is also responding to longtime complaints by allowing developers like Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. to create an application that can stream an unlimited number of games within the single app. That change will be available globally.\nThe Digital Markets Act, or DMA, also makes it illegal for certain platforms to favor their own services over those of rivals. Companies are barred from combining personal data across their different services or using information they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them.\nIn a related matter, Apple faces a potentially huge fine from EU antitrust regulators over how its App Store rules allegedly thwart music-streaming rivals from offering alternative, cheaper subscription options. That investigation was sparked by European music streaming giant Spotify Technology SA. The fine could be as much as 10% of Apple\u2019s annual sales \u2014 although EU penalties seldom reach that level.\nAcross the Atlantic, there has also been an antitrust focus on App Store abuses. In mid-January, the US Supreme Court declined to hear appeals by Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. related to an antitrust suit over the App Store, bringing the case to a conclusion.\nThe trial judge in that case found Apple\u2019s App Store rules didn\u2019t violate federal antitrust law. However, she ruled that the company\u2019s limits on developer communications flouted California\u2019s state antitrust law.\nTim Sweeney, the chief executive officer of Epic Games, responded to Apple\u2019s new policies, saying the plan was a case of \u201cmalicious compliance.\u201d\n\u201cThey are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under DMA, or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don\u2019t process,\u201d Sweeney wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\nNonetheless, the game maker pledged to bring back Fortnite and launch its own app store for the iPhone. \u201cFortnite will return to iOS in Europe in 2024, distributed by the upcoming Epic Games Store for iOS,\u201d the company wrote on X, adding that it will \u201ccontinue to argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law.\u201d\nIn anticipation of the Apple announcement, Spotify said earlier this week that it would distribute companion apps to its main service via the web and enable in-app purchases inside its iPhone software.\nMargrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s antitrust chief, said Thursday that the main question with Apple\u2019s changes will be whether they are an attempt to follow the new rules or go around them.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what will be our test of it,\u201d she said during a briefing with journalists. \u201cIs this a way to circumvent the intention of the legislation?\u201d\n--With assistance from Sanne Wass.\n(Updates with Epic bringing back Fortnite in the fourth-to-last paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThere\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets\nBasketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer\u2019s New $2 Billion Arena\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly\u2019s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nHow to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). Until now.\nThe Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.\nAccording to the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apple\u2019s closely guarded ecosystem. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company\u2019s suite of products \u2014 including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags \u2014 blocks competition.\n\"You don't ramp up unless you find that there's something significant there that you want to investigate,\" adjunct Columbia University Law School professor Martin Edel said about the reported probe. The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.\nStill, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.\nApple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China, where it has offered a rare discount, as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.\nApple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.\nBut the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.\nA DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple\u2019s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.\nBut Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\nEdel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position.\nApple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to rein in Big Tech.\n\"The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,\" Edel said.\nUniversity of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.\nFor one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.\n\"If I were Apple, I\u2019d be pretty worried about this,\" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the world\u2019s top antitrust litigators in-house.\nCritics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.\nThe company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.\nInteroperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.\nThere are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.\nOne is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.\nIn that case, the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.\nHowever, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.\nApple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which has yet to say whether it will hear the case. What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit, Newman said, would depend on where the department chose to file its case.\n\"They could take the fight to Apple\u2019s doorstep, but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case,\" Newman said. \"DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.\"\nThe second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.\nClosing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.\nThe lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.\nIf the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.\nThose talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "The competition between Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT for the title of the world's most valuable company has become severe once again. This is especially true as Apple\u2019s market value has decreased to $2.87 trillion while Microsoft is trading at nearly $2.84 trillion.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The competition is not new as Microsoft has occasionally surpassed Apple in market value since 2018, most recently in 2021.The tug-of-war between the two tech giants has put focus on tech ETFs having the largest exposure to these companies. These are Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW and MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC.These ETFs have Apple and Microsoft as the top two holdings. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AppleAfter rising 48% in the previous year, the iPhone maker has been struggling in 2024, with shares plunging 4% on concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Two analysts \u2014 Piper Sandler and Barclays \u2014 downgraded the stock rating on worries about iPhone demand. iPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024 due to growing competitive pressure from Huawei and other domestic rivals.Adding to Apple's challenges is the tepid forecast for its new product, the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which is set to be launched in the United States on Feb 2. Analysts predict that its impact on Apple's earnings per share will be minimal.Further, the tech giant had offered a cautious outlook for the holiday quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that revenues in the quarter are expected to be \"similar\" to last year, with revenues for Mac, iPad and Wearables categories expected to \"decelerate significantly\" from the fourth quarter.MicrosoftMicrosoft rose 2% in 2024 after a 57% surge in 2023, given its strength in the cloud business and artificial intelligence drive. The world\u2019s largest software maker is optimistic about the long-term prospects of its Azure business, as it expects revenues in this segment to continue to accelerate (read: ETFs to Tap Microsoft's Longest Win Streak Since 2021).Azure has become Microsoft\u2019s key growth engine in recent years and has helped revive the company\u2019s brand among developers, according to CNBC.ValuationBoth tech companies look relatively expensive in terms of price-to-earnings ratios.

        "Title": "Will Microsoft Still Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently overtook Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as the world's most valuable company. As of this writing, Microsoft's market cap has reached $2.89 trillion and remains higher than Apple's market cap of $2.87 trillion.\nThis isn't the first time Microsoft's valuation eclipsed Apple's, but can it maintain that lead through the end of 2025? Let's take a fresh look at both tech giants to find out.\nApple's stock declined 4% over the past three months as its critics lamented its sluggish iPhone sales and lack of near-term catalysts. It still generated more than half of its revenue from the iPhone in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), but its handset sales declined 2% during the year as the 5G upgrade cycle ended. China's sluggish economy recovery and fierce currency headwinds exacerbated that pressure.\nApple's Mac sales also continued to slip in a post-pandemic market as fewer consumers upgraded their laptops and desktops. As a result, Apple's revenue dipped 3%, and its earnings per share stayed nearly flat for the full year.\nAnalysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 4% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as it laps that slowdown and the macro environment improves. The expansion of its services ecosystem, which already hosts more than 1 billion paid subscriptions, could also amplify that recovery.\nMoreover, the launch of its Vision Pro headset could gradually diversify its hardware business -- even if its $3,500 price tag limits its early adoption to affluent tech enthusiasts.\nApple's business remains broadly stable, while its $162 billion in cash and marketable securities gives it plenty of room to expand through investments and acquisitions. However, the lack of big near-term catalysts -- along with its stretched-forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28 -- are limiting its gains as the bulls rush toward more exciting growth plays.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's stock rose 19% over the past three months as it impressed the market with the growth of its cloud business, the expansion of its artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, and its takeover of Activision Blizzard.\nMicrosoft owns Azure, the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS). Azure notably grew at a much faster rate than AWS in its latest quarter, and its year-over-year revenue growth actually accelerated as AWS' revenue growth merely stabilized from its previous quarter.\nMicrosoft attributed that acceleration to the integration of OpenAI's AI tools into Azure and its other cloud services. Microsoft is also the top investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, making the Windows company one of the easiest ways to invest in the AI market.\nMicrosoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard should strengthen its Xbox business, add more games to its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming libraries, and ensure that it keeps pace with Sony and Nintendo in the console race.\nSimply put, the expansion of Microsoft's cloud, AI, and gaming businesses are offsetting the slower growth of its PC-oriented businesses and made it a more exciting investment than Apple. Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both grew 7% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), even as it faced tough currency headwinds and slower enterprise spending in this challenging macro environment. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to both grow 15% in fiscal 2024.\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft's shares might seem a bit pricier than Apple's. Nevertheless, its stronger growth and exposure to the AI market might easily justify that higher valuation.\nLooking further ahead, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 6% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2025. They expect Microsoft's revenue and earnings to both rise by another 15% in fiscal 2025.\nInvestors should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Apple needs to prove it can expand beyond the iPhone -- while Microsoft could continue to dazzle investors with the growth of its cloud and AI businesses. Therefore, I believe Microsoft has a clear shot at outperforming Apple throughout 2025 and widening its lead as the world's most valuable company.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Meanwhile, Apple gained 0.2% and closed with a market capitalization of $2.87 trillion. It\u2019s the first time since November 2021 that Microsoft has closed with a higher value than Apple.\n\u201cWhen you compare and contrast the two, the growth Apple is showing is nothing special, whereas Microsoft has done a better job of executing and demonstrating earnings growth,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, which has positions in both. \u201cMicrosoft also has a much clearer roadmap with AI, and it has done a great job articulating how that will accelerate growth to make its long-term prospects even more compelling.\u201d\nWhile both were part of the so-called Magnificent 7\u2019s powerful rally in 2023, their fortunes have diverged this year. Microsoft has risen 3.3%, supported by ongoing optimism over artificial intelligence, while Apple has dropped 3.4% amid rising concerns over its growth. It has been hit by at least three analyst ratings downgrades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nWall Street\u2019s less-favorable view on Apple suggests it would not be surprising if Microsoft maintained or even built on its newfound size advantage. The average analyst price target for Microsoft equates to upside of about 8% over the coming 12 months, slightly above Apple\u2019s return potential.

        "Text": "Apple's Vision Pro represents the company's first push into AI, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.\nIves upped his sales forecast of the Vision Pro to more than 600,000 units in 2024 and more than 1 million units in 2025.\nIves reiterated his $250 price target for Apple, representing potential upside of 30%.\nThe Friday release of Vision Pro is a \"historical moment\" for Apple and represents the company's first real push into artificial intelligence, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.\nThe $3,500 headset is Apple's first new product launch since the AirPods in 2016 and Apple's first new computing gadget since the launch of the Apple Watch in 2015, and is just the beginning of the company's foray into what it's calling \"spatial computing.\"\n\"We believe this is just the start for this new form factor with our industry checks showing the next version of Vision Pro 2 will have much lower price points in the sub $2k area code (could be 2-3 models released) as Apple looks to push more aggressively towards its golden installed base,\" Ives wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nThe \"golden installed base\" Ives is referring to is Apple's more than 1 billion iPhone users, and Wall Street estimates suggest that if the company could convert just 1% of its iPhone base into Vision Pro users, it would generate enough revenue to have a substantial impact on the company's bottom line.\nIves increased his sales estimate of the Vision Pro to more than 600,000 units in 2024 from his prior estimate of 460,000 units. Ives also expects the Vision Pro to sell more than one million units in 2025.\n\"We also believe future Vision Pro models will resemble form factors that look like sunglasses over the coming years and be a much broader reach/functionality for Apple users down the road with north of 1 million Vision Pro units our initial sales bogey for FY25,\" Ives wrote.\nA recent report suggests Apple sold 200,000 Vision Pro units after preorders began on January 19.\nBut for Ives, the real allure of the Vision Pro is that it will serve as a platform for Apple's artificial intelligence ambitions, which should ultimately help boost Apple's stock price to $250, representing potential upside of 30% from current levels.\n\"This is the first step to Apple pushing into AI and eventually a separate AI App Store we expect Apple to discuss initially as WWDC this summer. For Apple the ultimate goal in our opinion is that Vision Pro will work alongside the iPhone and other Apple devices over the coming years with many consumer AI use cases set to explode across health, fitness, sports content, and autonomous,\" Ives explained.\nIves reiterated his \"Outperform\" rating on Apple stock. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results after the market close on Thursday.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Title": "Is It Worth Investing in Apple (AAPL) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Apple (AAPL).\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AAPL\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>The ABR suggests buying Apple, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs AAPL Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $6.60.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Microsoft briefly overtakes Apple as world's most valuable company, before Apple takes back crown",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) on Thursday briefly overtook Apple\u2019s (AAPL) market capitalization, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. The software giant took the top spot just after the start of trading, hitting north of $2.8 trillion. Apple\u2019s market cap was also trading above $2.8 trillion, but was just behind Microsoft.\nThe two companies quickly traded spots again, putting Apple back on top, and continued switching places throughout the morning. Shares of Apple have struggled in the first two weeks of the year, as analysts from three banks downgraded the company\u2019s stock amid fears of slowing iPhone demand.\nOn Wednesday Redburn Atlantic analyst James Cordwell said he saw little room for upside for Apple\u2019s stock in the next few years, and that an \u201canticipated underwhelming March quarter could impact confidence in this outlook.\u201d\nBarclays's Tim Long also downgraded Apple\u2019s stock, dropping it to Underweight from Equal Weight, and lowered its price target from $161 to $160. Piper Sandler\u2019s Harsh Kumar also slapped the stock with a downgrade to Neutral.\nAnalysts generally fear that Apple iPhone 15 is underperforming in China amid renewed homegrown rival Huawei and the country\u2019s broader economic slowdown.\nGreater China is Apple\u2019s third-largest revenue driver behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company\u2019s $383.3 billion in total revenue.\nDespite those downgrades, analysts on Wall Street are still overwhelmingly positive; 32 of the 53 analysts tracking the stock currently maintain Buy ratings. Another 16 have Hold ratings, and just five analysts have Sell ratings on the stock.\nApple is also gearing up to roll out its hotly anticipated Vision Pro AR/VR headset. The device, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, goes on sale Feb. 2 for $3,499. That starting price is expected to be a steep barrier for most consumers, but if the headset proves consumers and enterprises are interested in diving deeper into the AR/VR space, it could be a boon for Apple in the long run.\nWhile Apple is facing fears over iPhone sales, Microsoft is looking to ensure that its massive investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its own generative AI offerings pay off for investors.\nThe company has poured billions into OpenAI, a partnership that is coming under increasing scrutiny from regulators in the UK and EU, and needs to show that its customers are actually buying into generative AI-powered apps.\nSo far things are looking bright for Microsoft. In its fiscal Q1 earnings report, the company said its AI tools provided a better-than-expected boost to its cloud business.\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, brought in $24.3 billion in the quarter, better than Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $23.6 billion. Azure and other cloud services revenue jumped 29% in the quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations of 27%.\nMicrosoft is also banking on its AI investments permeating the consumer market, as it launches a new Copilot key for Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The move, which required buy-in from Microsoft\u2019s OEM partners, marks the first major update to Windows keyboards in nearly 30 years.\nIntel, AMD, and Qualcomm have also introduced new processors designed to power on-device AI capabilities, adding to the broader AI push into the consumer market. The PC industry is gearing up for a potential turnaround in 2024 as consumers begin to venture out and buy new laptops and desktops after holding off over the past four years.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Reality is Starting to Set In",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a darling of the markets and a member of the \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d Yet, investors are starting to see the reality of the situation on 2024\u2019s first trading day. I am neutral on AAPL stock, and I would send an urgent message to Apple\u2019s perma-bulls: high-flying stocks generally need to correct or consolidate before the next leg up.\nApple is a world-famous manufacturer of smartphones and other tech gadgets. Apple is also known for various services, including streaming.\nWith a $2.88 trillion market capitalization, Apple is bigger than all other U.S. companies. This might sound bullish, but no company is unstoppable, and no stock can just keep going up without taking a break. This is even true for AAPL stock, which fell today in what might be a bad omen for 2024.\nIf you look up \u201cexhaustion\u201d in the dictionary, you might find a picture of Apple stock\u2019s one-year price chart. I\u2019m joking, of course, but the point is that investing in Apple right now involves serious downside risk.\nFrom a chart perspective, Apple hit major resistance at just below $200 in July and then again in December. In hindsight, AAPL stock really needed to take a breather after its relentless rally in 2023\u2019s first half.\nFurthermore, after gaining around 52% last year, Apple stock appears to have more room below than above. That air pocket below could easily get filled now that Apple\u2019s market cap is so elevated.\nValue-focused investors should be concerned, as Apple\u2019s trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio was nearly 8x before today\u2019s share-price drop. For comparison\u2019s sake, the sector median P/S ratio is slightly above 3x.\nI chose to cite Apple\u2019s P/S ratio because the company\u2019s sales are a topic of discussion today \u2013 but more on that in a moment. First, I wanted to be fair and balanced and acknowledge one analyst\u2019s bullish perspective on Apple.\nAfter AAPL stock\u2019s \u201cmagnificent\u201d rally last year, it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that some analysts are bullish on the stock. Among the most vocal Apple optimists on Wall Street is a well-known analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Apple\u2019s iPhone sales haven\u2019t been stellar in China. There, customers are loyal to China-based smartphone brands, especially Huawei.\nThe market largely overlooked this problem for Apple, and Ives doesn\u2019t seem very concerned about it. The Wedbush analyst seems dismissive of what he calls the \u201cgrowing noise and Huawei competition in China\u201d and the \u201ciPhone China demise narrative,\u201d which Ives called a \u201cgreat fictional story\u201d cooked up by the bears.\nWith that in mind, Ives reiterated his Outperform rating on AAPL stock and published a Street-high $250 price target on the shares. Only time will tell whether Apple can manage to live up to Ives\u2019 confident vision, as the company\u2019s issues in China won\u2019t just go away tomorrow or next week.\nIn stark contrast to Ives and many other Apple bulls, one analyst dared to issue a warning about the company today. It\u2019s a rare event since analysts usually heap praise upon Apple.\nSpecifically, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst\u00a0Tim Long\u00a0downgraded AAPL stock from a Hold to a Sell rating and lowered his price target on the shares from $161 to $160. That\u2019s not a huge price-target reduction, but the Sell rating is getting a lot of coverage in the financial media today.\nLong cited the \u201clackluster\u201d performance of Apple\u2019s iPhone 15, stating, \u201cOur checks remain negative on volumes and mix for iPhone 15, and we see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling.\u201d That\u2019s a powerful warning, as Apple\u2019s smartphones are the company\u2019s bread and butter.\nDon\u2019t expect Apple\u2019s Services business to rescue the company, either. On that topic, Long warned, \u201cWe also believe 2024 will bring more Services risk to light.\u201d\nMoreover \u2013 and here\u2019s the part that I fully agree with \u2013 Long expressed concerns about Apple\u2019s overextended valuation versus the company\u2019s actual results. \u201cThe continued period of weak results coupled with multiple expansion is not sustainable,\u201d Long cautioned.\nOn TipRanks, AAPL comes in as a Moderate Buy based on\u00a023 Buys,\u00a0seven Holds, and\u00a0one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Apple stock price target is $203.04, implying 10.2% upside potential.\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell AAPL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Krish Sankar of TD Cowen, with an average return of 47.31% per rating and a 93% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\nI wouldn\u2019t dare to short Apple shares, as the company is still a technology gadget juggernaut, and expensive stocks can always get more expensive. On the other hand, I\u2019m not prepared to dismiss Apple\u2019s China concerns like Ives seems to be doing.\nPlus, eager investors should take a long, hard look at Apple\u2019s valuation while also heeding Long\u2019s warnings. When all is said and done, Apple is still an important company with strong long-term growth prospects. However, much of Apple\u2019s anticipated growth is probably already priced into AAPL stock, so I\u2019m neutral on it and am not considering a share position now.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Apple's headset is the company's biggest bet in years",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Vision Pro is coming. And soon. The company announced on Monday that it will begin taking preorders for the headset beginning Jan. 19 at 8 a.m. ET, and that it will officially hit the company\u2019s online and physical stores in the US on Feb. 2.\nThis isn\u2019t just any product launch, though. This is Apple\u2019s first new product category in nearly 10 years. It last leaped into a new industry segment with the Apple Watch in 2015. But there\u2019s a big difference between the Vision Pro and the Apple Watch, outside of one going on your wrist and the other on your face.\nThe Apple Watch came to market at a time when fitness trackers and smartwatches were already well-established products. Fitbit was a household name when the Apple Watch hit, and people couldn\u2019t stop talking about tracking their steps.\nThe AR/VR headset space, though, is still largely untested with Meta\u2019s (META) Quest line of devices standing as the market leaders. And consumers don\u2019t appear to be as hooked on those headsets as Meta hoped.\nIn 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that more than half of Meta Quest headset owners didn\u2019t use their devices just six months after buying them. And according to the Verge, Meta\u2019s VP of VR Mark Rabkin specifically called out flagging user interest in the company\u2019s Quest 2 headset during a February 2023 employee meeting.\nBut Apple also has a powerful weapon that Meta doesn\u2019t: an enormous number of services subscribers with access to Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. And that alone could give Apple the kind of leg up on Meta it needs to dominate the AR/VR headset industry.\n\u201cApple is walking into a market that has not really taken off \u2026 meaningfully in recent years,\u201d IDC research analyst Ramon Llamas told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut, you know \u2026 where Apple goes, markets tend to rise.\u201d\nApple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, or spatial computer, as the company refers to it, will test the company\u2019s ability to get consumers interested in a product category that still feels like an answer looking for a question.\nSo far, gaming has been one of the main reasons consumers have picked up AR/VR headsets. But even those experiences are far from mind-blowing. I\u2019d rather play games on my PlayStation 5 and 65-inch OLED TV than on any headset. Wearing a headset for more than a half hour can be uncomfortable, the graphics on the PS5 are far superior to those any headset can produce, and certain games simply don\u2019t translate well to the headset form factor.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t play 'Fortnite' on a headset,\u201d said Forrester VP and principal analyst Julie Ask. \u201cThey're playing it on their PC because it's so fast and the graphics are so good.\u201d\nAR/VR companies are also leaning further into the enterprise space, with Meta pitching its headset as a means of having meetings in which you can interact with your co-workers in virtual spaces.\nBut let\u2019s be real. Having to turn on your laptop camera for a virtual meeting is hard enough. So, the idea that the average person will willingly strap on a headset to join yet another meeting is a bit hard to swallow.\nThat\u2019s not to say that headsets can\u2019t help when it comes to productivity. Using them as a means of viewing multiple windows and apps on a massive virtual display would be far better than trying to see all of my work on a single laptop screen.\nIn fact, Apple demonstrated the ability to use the Vision Pro as a kind of high-powered virtual display during a tech demo at WWDC in June. But it\u2019s hard to imagine the average consumer dropping $3,499 on a bigger screen.\nGaming and enterprise capabilities are certain to be a part of Apple\u2019s formula for success for the Vision Pro, but the company\u2019s secret weapon is its services business and the myriad offerings that entails.\n\u201c[Apple has] a fluid base that already subscribes to their media services,\u201d said Ask. \u201cIf I can instantly start watching movies and doing all these other things, Apple, one, has games \u2026 they have movies and TV shows and are compatible with my computer and my smartphone and all these other things, I don't have to go buy gaming titles one at a time and build a library.\u201d\nBeing able to view your existing apps, movies, photos, and more on the Vision Pro will prove to be a powerful feature for Apple, as it works to convince users that they need an AR/VR headset.\nApple\u2019s army of app developers should also prove extremely helpful in drumming up interest in the Vision Pro. After all, no one really understood how powerful the iPhone would be until Apple launched the App Store and allowed third-party apps on the smartphone. Getting more developers to build for the Vision Pro will be absolutely massive.\nThere\u2019s also the ease-of-use factor. While other headsets require you to learn how to use separate controllers and navigate new operating systems, the Vision Pro is relatively straightforward. Your eyes act as a kind of cursor that highlights whatever you\u2019re looking at in an app. To select an item, you simply tap your pointer finger and thumb together. It\u2019s that easy.\nThere\u2019s sure to be a learning curve for some apps and features, but that you can jump into the Vision Pro\u2019s world and start using it right away will prove to be extremely helpful.\nAll of that said, it\u2019s going to take a while for Apple to see major traction from the Vision Pro. It\u2019s still a wildly expensive device for most consumers. As Llamas explains, you\u2019d be able to buy a MacBook Air, iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch for less than the Vision Pro.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    and Alexis Keenan    ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has updated its long-standing App Store guidelines, giving developers the option to let users make in-app purchases for iOS apps outside of its App Store. But the changes still haven\u2019t won over one of the company\u2019s longtime critics.\nUnder the new rules, app developers can provide customers with links to third-party purchase options for their apps, but they must still pay Apple fees of either 12% or 27%.\nSpotify (SPOT), one of Apple\u2019s biggest critics, isn\u2019t a fan of the changes. In a statement, the music streaming service slammed the new rules.\n\u201cOnce again, Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\u201cTheir latest move in the US \u2014 imposing a 27% fee for transactions made outside of an app on a developer\u2019s website \u2014 is outrageous and flies in the face of the court's efforts to enable greater competition and user choice.\u201d\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, said the changes were part of a \"bad-faith 'compliance' plan,\" and called the revised fees \"anticompetitive.\"\nThe new App Store rules come after the US Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear Apple\u2019s appeal to a lower court\u2019s ruling that required Apple to let developers offer a third-party payment option for app purchases. An appeal by Epic was similarly denied.\nEpic Games originally filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in 2020, claiming that Apple\u2019s refusal to allow app developers to offer third-party payment options in their iOS apps violated antitrust laws. In particular, Epic took issue with the 15% and 30% fees Apple charged developers when consumers made app purchases via Apple\u2019s payment system. The fees, they said, positioned the App Store as an illegal monopoly that blocked competitors from the revenue stream.\nUS District Court Judge Gonzalez Rogers held that while Apple didn\u2019t break federal antitrust laws, it did violate California\u2019s Unfair Competition law by not letting developers offer their own payment options.\nBoth Epic Games and Apple appealed Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals before trying to get their cases heard in front of the Supreme Court.\nThe appeals court also said Epic failed to establish Apple's App Store as a relevant market. The court went on to say that Epic failed to meet a requirement to show a substantially less restrictive means by which Apple could maintain its iOS ecosystem.\nHowever, the Ninth Circuit let Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s determination that Apple had violated California\u2019s Unfair Competition law stand. To remedy the violation, the court ordered Apple to let developers include pathways for their users to make in-app purchases outside the App Store.\nOn Tuesday, Apple updated its app store rules giving developers the option to include a link to a separate website that users could use to make app purchases. But there\u2019s a catch.\nDevelopers will still have to pay Apple a fee. Instead of the 15% or 30% charges, though, Apple will assess developers a 12% or 27% fee. The 12% fee will apply to developers that take part in Apple\u2019s Small Business Program. The 27% applies to larger developers.\nIn order for developers to offer a third-party payment option to their users, they must include a disclosure sheet that will pop up whenever a user taps a link to make an outside payment. The disclosure sheet warns that Apple, \u201cis not responsible for the privacy or security of purchases made on the web.\u201d\nApple\u2019s App Store is under fire across the Atlantic as well. The company recently filed an appeal to the European Commission\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which could force the iPhone maker to completely overhaul its App Store business model.\nAccording to Reuters, Apple is appealing the EU's designation calling its App Store a single business. Instead, Apple says the App Store is actually five separate businesses with each one pertaining to its different operating systems: iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and iPadOS.\nIt\u2019s not just the DMA, though. The US Justice Department is also reportedly preparing to file an antitrust suit against Apple related to hardware and software business practices, according to Bloomberg. The DOJ hasn\u2019t decided if it\u2019s going to move forward with the suit yet, but if it does, it could come as soon as March.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Ryan Downie, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) rose 48.2% in 2023, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock climbed last year thanks to a combination of strong operational performance and swelling investor optimism.\nInvestors aggressively bought shares in reliable, high-quality businesses last year, especially if they provided some upside potential relative to mature value stocks. Apple's ability to navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment created surging investor confidence, and the stock benefited as a result.\nApple was one of many tech companies that delivered strong cash flow despite experiencing slowing sales over the past two years. Its revenue fell nearly 3% for the fiscal year that ended in September, though it saw acceleration in the most recent quarter to 13% growth. Consumers are struggling with high inflation, a difficult job market, and high interest rates on debt, all of which are bad news for businesses selling big-ticket consumer products.\nApple impressed investors with its work on the expense front. The company delivered cuts to the cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Importantly, its declining product sales were partially offset by higher-margin service revenue, which is associated with App Store fees and content streaming fees.\nThese factors, along with ongoing share repurchases, meant that Apple's earnings per share (EPS) increased, despite the top-line weakness. The company reported better-than-expected earnings in three of last year's quarterly reports.\nApple has firmly established itself as a reliable cash flow producer that can survive lean times and thrive during cyclical expansions.\nMarket forces played a major role in Apple's success last year. Its price chart was remarkably similar to that of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq index and is heavily exposed to large-cap tech stocks. The high level of correlation suggests that Apple shared key drivers with its sector peers.\nApple's valuations ratios also support that conclusion. The stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio climbed more than 35% during the year to 29. Investors were willing to pay a larger premium relative to short-term results. That indicates more optimism about Apple's prospects and higher investor risk tolerance overall.\nApple clearly owes much of its recent returns to market sentiment rather than to anything company-specific.\nApple's forward P/E ratio is approaching 30 right now, which might look a bit rich for investors. At this valuation, smaller growth stocks are likely to outpace Apple if there's a bull market around the corner. It's also expensive enough to suffer drawdowns if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.\nThe long-term narrative for Apple rests on its stellar performance as a cash flow generator along with its significant investment in disruptive technologies. The company is aiming to become a leader in virtual reality and artificial intelligence products. If it successfully establishes itself in these emerging industries, then strong financial results are likely to propel more shareholder gains in the future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "4 Things You Need to Know Before You Rush to Buy Apple Stock in 2024",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Everyone is familiar with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). As one of the best-known brands in the world, the business sells some of the most in-demand hardware products that consumers pay premium prices to own.\nApple shares have made for a fantastic investment over the years, climbing 817% in the last decade. And more recently, they rose 48% in 2023, beating the Nasdaq Composite. \nBut before you rush to buy this FAANG stock in 2024, here are four things you need to know.\nAlthough the company sells a variety of hardware products, like the Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, and iPad, Apple is still incredibly dependent upon the iPhone. In the last fiscal year (ended Sept. 30), the business generated 52% of its revenue from the flagship smartphone.\nFrom a profitability perspective, this is a good thing. The iPhone only represents about 20% of global smartphone shipments, but due to its pricing power, it accounts for roughly 80% of the industry's operating income. This helps explain why Apple is such a profitable enterprise. \nHowever, the iPhone is in a mature stage in its life cycle. With new upgrades having fewer game-changing features, it's easier for consumers to choose not to update their phones every year, instead holding on to their existing ones for longer.\nWhat makes Apple a truly great business is not just its hardware products, but the entire ecosystem. And a key aspect of this is the company's growing services segment. This division includes things like Apple Pay, iCloud, News, Music, and TV+. \nServices have been expanding at a faster rate than products in recent times. In fiscal 2023, services saw revenue increase by 9%, representing 22% of the overall company's sales. As more of Apple's revenue comes from services, it can be a boon for profitability, as this division carries a stellar gross margin of 71%.\nPerhaps more importantly, Apple's services drive customer loyalty and stickiness. They give consumers less reason to leave for offerings from competitors.\nI've mentioned how profitable Apple is. In the past 10 years, the company's operating margin has averaged a superb 27.9%. This isn't what you're used to seeing from a typical consumer electronics business. It points to Apple's strong brand and differentiation.\nAdditionally, Apple generates copious amounts of free cash flow (FCF). In just the last three fiscal years, FCF totaled a whopping $304 billion. Remember, this is the money left over after the business reinvests in growth opportunities. And it affords Apple financial flexibility that other companies can only dream about.\nManagement has used this FCF to aggressively buy back stock. Last fiscal year, nearly $78 billion went toward repurchasing shares. And in the last five years, the company's outstanding share count has been reduced by 21%.\nWhile it's difficult to find reasons not to like Apple's business, there's one important reason that investors should hesitate before buying the stock: valuation.\nAs of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.8. This is significantly more expensive than Apple's trailing-10-year average of 20.8. And it represents a huge premium to the S&P 500.\nIt's challenging to be optimistic about Apple generating market-beating returns going forward when the valuation is so high. This is especially true given how mature the company is these days, with more muted growth prospects than it had in past years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

Here's what to know about the payments.\nHow much will I get under the Apple iPhone settlement?\nApple is paying a total of $310 million to $500 million to settle the lawsuit over battery issues with older iPhones, according to Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, one of the law firms representing Apple customers. That breaks down to $92.17 per claimant, Mark C. Molumphy, a partner at the law firm, said in a statement.\nThe amount \"exceed[s] our original estimates, and [is] more than 100% of the claimed damages,\" Molumphy noted.\nWhat was batterygate all about?\nThe 2018 lawsuit related to claims that Apple deliberately slowed down the overall performance of older iPhones in making updates to its iOS mobile platform, allegedly to prevent aging batteries from shutting down completely when power demands were high.\nFor its part, Apple said its reason for reducing performance wasn't to made to hide battery defects, but rather was designed to prolong the lifespan of the devices, the company told the\u00a0Verge\u00a0in 2017. The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing by Apple, the claim website notes.\nHow many people are eligible for the payments?\nAbout 100 million consumers may have been eligible for money under the Apple settlement, but only about about 3.3 million iPhone users submitted claims prior to the deadline, according to legal documents.\nThe settlement was available to iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus and SE users running iOS 10.2.1 or later and iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users running iOS 11.2 or later before Dec. 21, 2017, according to the\u00a0settlement\u00a0site.\nWhat if I didn't submit a claim?\nUnfortunately, if you didn't submit a claim prior to the October 6, 2020, deadline, you aren't eligible to receive a check.\nHow will I know the payment is from Apple?\nAccording to posts on social media from people who received payments, the settlement money will appear as a direct deposit with the payment line \"IN RE APPLE INC.\"\n"

In contrast, sales increased in Europe and Japan.\nThe company\u2019s earnings come just one day before Apple begins selling one of its riskiest new hardware releases in recent years: An augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro.\nOver the past five years, Apple has spent an estimated $100 billion in research and development on the device, which will cost $3,499 in the US, according to a recent analysis.\nIn a statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company\u2019s growth was fueled by iPhone sales and an all-time revenue record in the company\u2019s services division in the last three months of 2023.\n\u201cWe are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments,\u201d Cook said.\nNet iPhone sales grew from $65.7 billion one year ago to $69.7 billion in the last three months of 2023, but Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said that China\u2019s revenue numbers indicate demand for the device in the region is slowing \u201cmore than expected in the face of rising competition from local companies, including Huawei.\u201d\n\u201cThe big question is if this is just a blip, or signs of a bigger shift among consumers as rising interest rates and a weaker economic backdrop discourage consumers from making pricey purchases,\u201d Cohen said.\nCook addressed concerns about falling sales in China, saying, \u201cI remain very optimistic about China over the long term.\u201d\nOverall, Apple reported earnings per share of $2.18 for the quarter, a record for EPS for the company and higher than the $2.11 analysts had predicted.\nRevenue also beat analysts\u2019 expectations for the quarter at $119.6 billion.\nDespite beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines, Apple\u2019s stock dropped more than 3% after the market close.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock rose 48% in 2023 and helped the S&P 500 index surge back to its 2021 highs in December. The iPhone maker has one of the most loyal customer bases -- and an incredibly strong brand because of it -- but the stock's climb last year is somewhat puzzling, considering the company's recent sales decline.\nWhy are investors bidding the shares higher? Is it safe to buy at these highs? Here's what you need to know.\nSlowing sales growth wouldn't seem to support a stock hitting new highs and trading at a high valuation of 30 times next year's earnings estimates. However, iPhone sales, which make up almost half of Apple's business, hit a new record in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, returning to growth after sales declined for the full fiscal year.\nApple posted a 2.7% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales in fiscal Q4 despite being supply-constrained. The iPhone 15 has lifted the global smartphone market out of a recent sales slump and could be a catalyst for stronger top-line growth over the next year.\nInvestors have banked on the growth in the services business to make the case to buy Apple stock. Services include app sales, subscriptions, and AppleCare warranty plans and the segment generates higher margins than the iPhone and other devices. While services sales were up 16% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, it wasn't enough to drive growth for the entire company, as total sales fell slightly in fiscal 2023.\nNonetheless, there is a reason Warren Buffett continues to make Apple Berkshire Hathaway's largest stock holding, a stake worth over $156 billion as of Sept. 30.\nDespite other smartphones that beat Apple with innovative features, Apple continues to grow its base of active devices and generate loads of cash to fund investments in artificial intelligence and other features to maintain high customer satisfaction scores.\nApple's iOS mobile operating system trails Alphabet's Android in market share. Android consistently commands over 80% share of the mobile market, according to Counterpoint Research. But Apple commanded half of the smartphone market's total sales. Most impressive is that Apple generates a high percentage of the smartphone market's operating profit.\nApple's brand helps the company price its products to earn higher profits than its competitors -- a key competitive advantage and why the stock deserves to trade at a high valuation. Apple generated $99 billion in free cash flow on $383 billion of total sales in fiscal 2023.\nThe Oracle of Omaha loves to make big bets on companies with strong brands, especially if those brands can produce high margins and keep growing over the long term. Apple possesses these qualities in spades.\nApple stock isn't going to appreciate by 48% every year, but the blue chip stock can deliver solid returns over many years.\u00a0\"Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem,\" CFO Luca Maestri said on the fiscal Q4 earnings call.\nBecause Apple has such a low share of unit sales in the smartphone market, the company has ample opportunity to grow iPhone sales over the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

Shares of Apple\u2019s Big Tech peers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META), on the other hand, are up 1.9%, 2.2%, and 4.9%, respectively.\nIn general, Redburn Atlantic, Barclays, and Piper Sandler point to potential weakness across Apple\u2019s iPhone and services segment. Barclays' Long and Piper Sandler\u2019s Kumar both point to China as a major concern, with Long saying that Barclays' latest checks show incrementally worse iPhone 15 data points out of the region, and Kumar citing China\u2019s deteriorating macro environment.\nGreater China is Apple\u2019s third-largest revenue driver behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company\u2019s $383.3 billion in total revenue.\nAccording to Long, while Apple should report December quarter revenue in line with market expectations, the company will report March revenue below the market consensus.\nKumar, for his part, says negative news surrounding the ongoing Apple Watch patent controversy and antitrust fights could prove to be problematic for Apple moving forward.\nBut Wall Street isn\u2019t entirely down on the iPhone maker. Of the 53 analysts tracking Apple, 32 maintain Buy ratings, while 16 have Hold ratings. Just five analysts have Sell ratings on the stock.\nEvercore ISI\u2019s Amit Daryanani reiterated his Outperform rating on Apple with a price target of $220, saying that now might be the time to buy the dip in the company\u2019s stock price.\nAnd while he admits Apple Watch bans are problematic and Apple\u2019s multibillion-dollar agreement to make Google the default search engine in Safari might be at risk, there are more positives than negatives to Apple\u2019s story.\n\u201cAs some of the fears abate and we shift to a more positive news flow (Vision Pro), [Apple] could start to re-rate in a more positive manner,\u201d Daryanani wrote.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Erik Woodring says that Apple\u2019s 2024 could offer a big lift for the company.\n\u201cWe believe that not only are fundamentals on the path to recovery (albeit with some near-term unevenness), but more importantly, 2024 will be the year when Apple's 'Edge AI' opportunity likely comes to fruition, highlighted by an LLM-powered Siri 2.0 and a broader Gen AI-enabled operating system (introduced at WWDC in June) that has the potential to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors.\nApple hasn\u2019t specifically announced a generative AI offering, instead focusing on machine learning to improve the accuracy of its autocomplete feature. But the company is reportedly hard at work integrating the technology into its future products.\nApple could also stand to benefit from an expected resurgence in laptop and desktop sales, as consumers who purchased computers at the start of the pandemic begin to seek out newer, faster systems.\nAll of this comes as Apple prepares to launch its $3,499 Vision Pro spatial computing headset in February. Preorders for the device start Jan. 19. Apple\u2019s first new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro is expected to get off to a slow sales start as a result of its relatively high price.\nAnd depending on how the Vision Pro roll out goes, Apple could drive a significant amount of interest in the headset among both consumers and enterprise users. No, most people won\u2019t be able to afford the Vision Pro out of the gate, but even creating buzz around the product could benefit Apple\u2019s stock price.\nWith the Vision Pro launch just a few short weeks away, we won\u2019t have to wait long to see if Apple\u2019s slow start to 2024 is a fluke or long-term trend.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook called out the company\u2019s AI investments on Thursday, adding that the tech giant will show off the fruits of those moves in the year ahead.\nThe comment, which Cook made during Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings call, is the clearest signal yet that the company doesn\u2019t want to be perceived as missing out on Wall Street\u2019s favorite tech trend.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,\u201d Cook said during the call.\n\"I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with gen. AI and AI,\" he later added in response to an analyst's question.\nApple has been comparatively silent on generative AI save for a few sparing responses to analysts during the company\u2019s earnings calls. All the while, Apple\u2019s Big Tech rivals, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), have continued to push out a variety of generative AI products.\nInstead, Apple has largely focused on announcements related to machine learning improvements to the company\u2019s iOS operating system in the form of features like updated autocorrect for the keyboard.\nWhile Apple hasn\u2019t jumped on the generative AI train like its brethren, the company has been working in the space for some time. The iPhone and Macs running on its M-series chips featured built-in neural engines long before the PC market, which only began boasting about AI PCs during CES last month.\nBut without a clear callout to the AI craze, Apple appeared to be behind the curve.\nAnalysts, meanwhile, have been hoping Apple would roll out some kind of AI product in 2024 as part of either an iOS update or alongside the iPhone 16. And while Cook didn\u2019t specify when or how we would see the company\u2019s AI investments show up, it\u2019s a safe bet its most important device and operating system stand to benefit.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple began testing its own ChatGPT-style bot last year and is working to develop a version of Siri with generative AI functionality. AI, he says, will also find its way across iOS 18.\nCook\u2019s reveal comes as Apple is launching its most ambitious product in years: the Vision Pro. A \u201cspatial computer,\u201d the headset, which starts at $3,499, will serve as a new computing platform for the company.\nBut the device\u2019s sky-high price tag could hamper sales among average consumers, who could balk at spending so much on a completely new product category.\nDuring the earnings call, Cook said Apple is seeing a good amount of interest in the Vision Pro from enterprise customers, including demos that take advantage of the headset\u2019s capabilities.\nOutside of that, Cook said that iPhone sales measured in constant currency in mainland China were only down single digits. The comment, which Cook made in response to an analyst question, comes as Apple saw Greater China revenue fall to $20.8 billion in the first quarter this year from $23.9 billion in Q1 2023.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Leah Nylen, Greg Stohr and Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is opening its US App Store to allow outside payment options after the Supreme Court refused to consider the company\u2019s appeal in an antitrust suit challenging its practices.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nFlorida Governor DeSantis Drops Out of 2024 Race, Endorses Trump\nHedge Funds Rake in Huge Profits Betting on Catastrophe Risk\nGloom Over China Assets Is Spreading Beyond Battered Stocks\nTrump Retires \u2018DeSanctimonious\u2019 Insult After DeSantis Backs Him\nPutin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union\nThe company plans to let all third-party apps sold in the US include an outside link to a developer website to process payments for in-app purchases. That will bypass Apple\u2019s own payment system, which charges developers a commission of either 15% or 30%. Still, the iPhone maker said it would attempt to collect a 12% or 27% revenue share from developers that opt out of the Apple system.\nThe Supreme Court decision let stand a 2023 appeals court ruling that found Apple\u2019s business model didn\u2019t violate antitrust laws, but that it did flout California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law by limiting the developers ability to communicate about alternate payment systems that may cost less.\nBoth Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. had asked the court to hear an appeal related to the case. The justices turned down the appeals without explanation.\nApple shares slid as much as 2.7% after the court\u2019s announcement before paring their decline. The stock was down 1.2% to $183.63 at the close in New York.\nDevelopers will need to apply for an \u201centitlement\u201d to be able to use outside payments systems. Apple previously allowed reader apps \u2014 a category that includes video streaming and book reading applications \u2014 to point users to the web to sign up for subscriptions. Apple will warn customers when they press a link to conduct purchases outside the App Store before letting them proceed.\n\u201cAs of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web,\u201d Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a thread on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.\nBut he took issue with Apple\u2019s plan to charge what he called a \u201c27% tax\u201d on web transactions. If app developers have to pay that fee to Apple and a cut of 3% to 6% to third-party payment processors, they can\u2019t afford to offer lower costs to consumers, he said. Sweeney also described Apple\u2019s planned warning to customers as a \u201cscare screen.\u201d\n\u201cEpic will contest Apple\u2019s bad-faith compliance plan in District Court,\u201d he said.\nBillions of dollars are at stake. In app spending is forecast to reach $182 billion this year and $207 billion in 2025, according to research firm Sensor Tower. And competitors are ready to steal a piece of it: Microsoft Corp. has said that it\u2019s already in talks to launch a mobile app store focused on gaming.\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals last year largely affirmed a lower-court judge\u2019s 2021 decision largely rejecting claims by Epic that Apple\u2019s online marketplace policies violated federal antitrust law because they ban third-party app marketplaces on its operating system. The appeals court also upheld a federal judge\u2019s ruling that the iPhone maker\u2019s practices don\u2019t violate federal antitrust law, rejecting the bulk of Epic\u2019s case against Apple\u2019s App Store.\nThat decision had been on hold while the Supreme Court appeals were pending. The high court\u2019s decision ended a temporary stay in the case.\nThe Epic case was the first to challenge Apple\u2019s lucrative App Store system, which rakes in billions of dollars each year. In the interim, the company has come under serious pressure around the world, including in Europe where competition enforcers have two antitrust cases pending against the tech giant. EU authorities are expected to fine the company later this year for allegedly using its App Store rules to thwart music-streaming rivals like Spotify Technology SA.\nIn a separate Epic suit in December, a jury found that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unfairly wields monopoly power in its Android app store. Google has said it plans to appeal, but key legislation in Europe \u2014 as well as investigations in the US and UK and an expected wave of follow-on lawsuits \u2014 will keep pressure on the tech giants\u2019 app store duopoly.\nThe cases are Apple v.

        "Title": "Apple iPhone target is billions short of Wall Street's as China sales lag",
        "Author": "  Stephen Nellis ",
        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) -Apple on Thursday forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below Wall Street expectations as its China business took a hit.\nThis overshadowed overall fiscal first-quarter sales and profit that beat analysts' targets, powered by iPhone growth, sending Apple shares down 3% in after-hours trade.\nThe results confirmed some analysts' concerns that the company's signature product is losing ground in the key Asian market where consumers are buying foldable phones and phones from Huawei, powered by a China-made chip.\n\"China is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and that hasn't changed,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. He said iPhone sales there were down \"mid-single digits\" in the December quarter, when accounting for currency exchange rates.\n\"In China, Apple is facing more competitive challenges not only because of Huawei but also because of foldables, which is a very popular and fast-growing segment in China - and as we all know, Apple does not have a foldable device - yet,\" said IDC analyst Nabila Popal.\nApple said sales in China in the December quarter were $20.82 billion, missing analyst estimates of $23.53 billion, according to LSEG data.\nRevenue in the current quarter will be at least $5 billion less than a year ago, when the company sold iPhones rapidly to replenish inventories drawn down by COVID-related factory shutdowns, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call.\nMaestri's comments implied a revenue forecast of about $90 billion and iPhone sales of around $46 billion for the fiscal second quarter that ends in March. Wall Street expected nearly $96 billion in revenue and iPhone sales of $50 billion. They were $51 billion in the 2023 quarter.\nThat would make it the company's worst fiscal second quarter of iPhone sales since widespread COVID lockdowns in March 2020.\n\"The drag would be China - and it has everything to do with their seasonality, and the elongated replacement cycle,\" said Ben Bajarin, CEO of research firm Creative Strategies.\n\"Regardless of what happens, (a drop in) year-over-year iPhone sales would be more of a concern than a quarter.\"\nFor its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30, Apple reported sales of $119.58 billion and profit of $2.18 per share, both above analyst expectations of $117.91 billion and $2.10 per share.\nSales of iPhones hit $69.70 billion in the quarter, growing 6% to beat analyst expectations of $67.82 billion, on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple's total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago.\n\"We had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China,\" Cook said.\n'HUGE OPPORTUNITY'\nWhere Apple's results disappointed, two other tech heavyweights, Amazon.com and Facebook owner Meta Platforms, reported quarterly results on Thursday which led to jumps in their share prices.\nMicrosoft in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the AI race among tech heavyweights.\nApple has rarely discussed generative AI but on Thursday Cook said on the conference call that it was a \"huge opportunity\" and there was \"a lot of work going on internally\" but that he did not plan to discuss it publicly until later this year.\nIn the rest of Asia beyond China and Japan, Apple's sales hit $10.16 billion, above analyst estimates. Cook said that iPhone sales hit an all-time high in South Korea, home to longtime rival Samsung Electronics.\nThe biggest growth area for Apple during its fiscal first quarter was its services business, which includes the Apple TV+ service as well as music, iCloud storage and the App Store, and which rose 11% to $23.12 billion in sales, slightly below analyst expectations.\nApple's App Store also faces a challenge in Europe, where a new law that takes effect in March will allow developers to skip paying commissions to Apple and place alternative app stores on the iPhone.\nApple's first-quarter Mac sales were up slightly to $7.78 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Sales of iPads were down 25% to $7.02 billion, a little behind Wall Street's target.\nApple's wearables segment, which includes its AirPods and Apple Watch sales, fell to $11.95 billion after company executives had warned of weak demand, just enough to top analysts' targets\nThe company's Vision Pro headset will be included in the segment in subsequent quarters, though analysts do not expect it to bring meaningful revenue for several years.\nSeveral Apple Watch models have been at the center of a legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo and were briefly pulled from shelves before Apple removed a blood-oxygen monitoring features to comply with legal rulings and keep selling the devices.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San FranciscoAdditional reporting by Arsheeya Singh Bajwa and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Max A.

        "Author": "  Takashi Mochizuki and Yuki Furukawa ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- TDK Corp. is fielding surging inquiries in Asia into a new lineup of smartphone batteries it hopes will become a game-changer in the quest to pack more power into ever-slimmer devices.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSEC X Account Compromised to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETFs Approved\nUS and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\nBlackRock Cuts 3% of Global Workforce, Citing Dramatic Industry Shifts\nXi, Biden and the $10 Trillion Cost of War Over Taiwan\nIPhone Survives 16,000-Foot Fall, Helps Steer Jet-Panel Hunt\nThe Apple Inc. supplier is the first to apply to smartphones a technological breakthrough that its rivals have been exploring mainly as a means to stretch mileage for electric vehicles, according to TDK Chief Executive Officer Noboru Saito. In the first half of 2023, the company began shipping small-size lithium-ion batteries using silicon electrodes, manufactured by Hong Kong-based subsidiary Amperex Technology Ltd. (ATL).\nTDK, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphone batteries, is one of several big-name players in a race to enhance energy storage \u2014 the industry\u2019s holy grail. Its rivals are taking a different approach for consumer products. Samsung SDI Co. and LG Energy Solution are stacking materials for more compact batteries with higher energy density. Other options run the gamut from graphene-based cells and solid-state batteries to hydrogen fuel cells or sodium-ion batteries.\nTo keep its lead in the cutthroat smartphone field, where TDK controls more than a third of the battery market, the company will have to keep chasing knowhow, Saito said.\n\u201cWe need to assume that other companies will come into this space, and we need to develop the next, followed by the next, technology to differentiate ourselves and keep our lead from shrinking,\u201d the 57-year-old said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s room for the technology to evolve further.\u201d\nTDK now is the sole mass-producer of silicon-carbon batteries for smartphone use. Interest is especially strong from handset makers seeking to gain an edge in a saturated market through ultra-thin devices and different designs, which the high-capacity batteries allow.\nOne example is Shenzhen-based Honor Device Co.\u2019s latest foldable smartphone, measuring less than 10mm thick, the Magic V2, according to analysts. TDK declined to comment, saying that it does not disclose the names of any of its customers. Honor, whose website said its phone has a silicon-carbon dual battery, vies with Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo Co. and Xiaomi Corp. in China and Asia more broadly. It declined to comment on its suppliers.\nTDK says its new battery has 10% more capacity than conventional graphite anode batteries, although industry studies show the technology has the potential to lift capacity by 40% or more. The product should be able to extend battery life in more devices, including mobile game gadgets, wearables and AI-related edge tools, while slimming down their size, Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said.\nFor TDK, high-end batteries offer one path to achieve sustainable growth in an item seen as commoditized. The battery segment earns more than half of TDK\u2019s annual revenue, with smartphone makers comprising the bulk of its biggest customers. But growth in smartphone batteries has been flat, TDK has said in recent earnings calls, triggering concerns of slowing growth due to clients\u2019 paper-thin margins.\nSaito said he expects the new products to make up a double-digit percentage of the company\u2019s overall smartphone battery sales in terms of volume in the next few years, up from less than 5% now.\nTDK acquired ATL, founded by Robin Zeng, in 2005 and expanded its production into the smartphone market, where it won big clients Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. ATL\u2019s nascent EV battery business was spun out in 2011 into Hong Kong-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., with which ATL now has two joint ventures to make rechargeable batteries and battery cells for household energy storage, motorcycles and industrial machines.\n\u201cSome may say that our battery sales are headed for a gradual decline, but I disagree. I guarantee that batteries will be a sustainable and big pillar of the group\u2019s portfolio, even over the long term,\u201d Saito said. \u201cAs we head into the age of AI where the world gets ever more connected, the demands placed on batteries will only grow, and it\u2019s our mission to meet those needs through new and evolving technology.\u201d\n--With assistance from Gao Yuan.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nTropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire\nPrivate Equity\u2019s Horrible, No-Good \u201923 Set to Continue Into \u201924\nIs There Any Hope for Hollywood?\nCan Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump\u2019s?\nWhy \u2018Dad\u2019 Should Not Be Part of Your Professional Vocabulary\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "A price war in mainland China, the world's largest smartphone market, has intensified amid widening discounts offered for iPhones by online marketplaces, as Apple unseated rival Samsung Electronics in annual industry shipments worldwide for the first time in 2023.\nChinese e-commerce giant JD.com on Monday touted deeper discounts of as much as 800 yuan (US$112.24) off on the latest iPhone 15 model in a post on WeChat, which was on the same day Apple offered to cut prices by up to 500 yuan on a range of models, including the iPhone 13 and its new handsets that debuted last September.\nThe latest iPhone markdowns have come as major Chinese smartphone vendors, including Xiaomi and Honor, knocked down prices on their various Android models in both online and offline retail campaigns. Huawei Technologies, which last year made a comeback in the 5G smartphone market, did not pursue a similar strategy.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nApple's atypical discount drive on the mainland shows the US tech giant's focus to gain ground in the world's second-biggest economy amid sluggish global iPhone sales, which has seen the company hit by two ratings downgrades in the first week of this year.\nHuawei Technologies' Mate 60 Pro smartphones are seen on display at its store in Shanghai on September 8, 2023.

The Shenzhen-based company has so far not pushed to mark down the prices of its latest 5G handsets. Photo: Reuters>\n\"Apple faced more challenges in China compared to the rest of the world,\" said Will Wong, senior research manager for client devices at IDC Asia-Pacific. \"It not only faced competition from Huawei, but also a change in consumers' sentiment that is now more cautious in spending.\"\nIn the first week of the year, iPhone sales on the mainland were already down 30 per cent year on year, according to a Jefferies research note published on January 7. The brokerage indicated that there was \"a big rise in discounts\" for the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models, while the newer iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models saw \"a moderate rise\" in discounts.\nThe iPhone's total sales volume last year on the mainland was down 3 per cent from 2022, which translated to a 0.4 per cent decline in Apple's market share, according to Jefferies.\nWorries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down this month, enabling Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company after ending the January 12 trading session in the US higher than the iPhone maker.\nStill, Apple received some good news on Monday when research firm IDC reported that the Cupertino, California-based company topped global smartphone shipments last year to dethrone long-standing market leader Samsung.\nApple's global smartphone shipments last year reached 234.6 million units that gave the company a record market share of 20.1 per cent, up 3.7 per cent from 226.3 million in 2022, according to IDC. Apple was also the sole smartphone vendor in the top-four rankings - including Samsung, Xiaomi and Oppo - to record unit shipment growth in 2023.\nOn the intense global smartphone competition, the \"overall Android space is diversifying within itself\", said Ryan Reith, group vice-president at IDC's Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers unit. \"Huawei is back and making inroads quickly within China.\"\nShenzhen-based Huawei's return to the premium segment of the smartphone market was paved by its launch last August of the Mate 60 Pro 5G handset, powered by an advanced home-grown processor that defied US tech restrictions. The company's new 5G smartphone and its advanced chip was hailed as symbolic of China's victory in defying tough US sanctions, fanning strong patriotic fervour that translated into robust domestic sales.\nHuawei, however, faces a supply shortage for the Mate 60 Pro because of production constraints. The popular 5G model is still subject to a reservation purchase scheme without immediate availability on the company's official website.\nAs Apple and its Chinese rivals turn to price promotions amid the weak macroeconomic environment on the mainland, Huawei will need to rely on the strength of its brand name to weather these headwinds, according to IDC's Wong.\n\"The production constraints seem like a hurdle to Huawei, but it may also be a marketing tactic [to create greater demand],\" Wong said.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "If you were to ask Apple, eighth-grade dropout Patrick Racz is just a \"Patent Troll\" with no inventions but an axe to grind. But having already chased the tech giant for $530 million, Racz has his sights on a much bigger prize, provided he can prove Apple stole its legendary iTunes idea from the inventor.\nRacz is locked in the middle of an $18 billion lawsuit against Apple, accusing the group of stealing his patent for the storage of music and videos through a software solution.\nThe inventor filed another lawsuit with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in October to force the group to disclose documents\u00a0related to his case against Apple, indicating he has no intention of pulling back any time soon.\nPrivate investors back Racz in his drawn-out and expensive pursuit of Apple for damages.\n\u201cThe technology I invented allowed Apple to become the biggest company in the world, and I still haven\u2019t earned a penny,\u201d Racz told the Times of London last year. \u201cAfter 21 years of fighting for justice, the time has come for me and my long-suffering investors to finally get paid.\u201c\nBut in an interview with the Guardian, Racz has detailed how a lengthy legal fight with Apple has left him ostracized from the tech community and with few friends in the industry as he finds himself labeled a patent troll from most\u00a0corners.\nHe has also faced death threats.\n\u201cThose things start to sting \u2013 when you\u2019re told that your kids should be burned at the stake and that you should be beheaded for what you\u2019re doing,\" Racz told the Guardian. He now says the fight with Apple has become his legacy.\nRacz made his fortune from a three-prong mixer tap that would distill hot, cold, and filtered water to its owners. After selling Avilion, the company behind the tap, Racz turned his eye toward music software.\nAfter setting up Smartflash in 2000, Racz obtained patents on systems that would store media including songs and videos. He says he discussed the idea with a technologist who would go on to become a senior director at Apple.\nHe also discussed it with Gemplus, a company that later partnered with Apple and used the product, he claims in his lawsuit.\n\u201cFrom that point on, virtually every product they launch incorporated my technology in some way, shape or form,\u201d Racz said of the launch of iTunes in 2003, the Times of London reports.\n\u201cI went through a period of deep depression,\u201d Racz told the Guardian of seeing his attempts at a second fortune wiped out in the dotcom boom while Apple launched its iTunes platform.\n\u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say I hit the bottle. I was totally lost in a haze of time and I couldn\u2019t remember a lot.\u201d\nRacz filed for a patent soon after he created the software but didn\u2019t obtain it until 2008, setting off his legal challenge against the $2.96 trillion company.\nHe has had minor successes during his long, tumultuous patent fight with Apple, but nothing long-lasting.\nBack in 2015, a judge ordered Apple to pay $532.9 million to Smartflash LLC for willful infringement of three U.S. patents.\nAs soon as he won that verdict, Racz and Smartflash pursued the company and other tech groups, including Google and Amazon, for four more patent infringements.\nTwo years later, though, Racz saw the decision quashed by an appeals court, which argued Smartflash\u2019s patents were invalid. He failed in his own appeal attempts, leading to the latest rampage against the group.\nA representative for Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nHowever, a representative recirculated a past comment it published in 2015 with the Guardian.\n\"Smartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no US presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented,\" the representative said.\n\"We refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

This initiative not only overshadows the initial plan of shifting nearly\u00a09% of its total production\u00a0to India by fiscal year 2024 but also denotes a significant rise in Apple's involvement in the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.\nIn the first three quarters of the fiscal year 2024, Apple, in collaboration with its suppliers,\u00a0Foxconn Hon Hai,\u00a0Pegatron\u00a0India (currently part of Tata Group), and\u00a0Wistron, has already produced\u00a0iPhones worth $9.4 billion ( INR 781.72 billion) in India. Surpassing\u00a0its full-year commitment of $8.9\u00a0billion (INR 740.16\u00a0billion) under the\u00a0PLI scheme, this figure signifies a notable increase in production capacity.\nInterestingly,\u00a0only a quarter of these\u00a0iPhones will serve the Indian market, with the majority intended for export to regions such as\u00a0the US, Europe, and West\u00a0Asia.\nSee Also:\u00a0UPI Goes International: Google India And NPCI Sign MoU For Global Expansion\nThe turnover of Apple's India sector was\u00a0approximately $5.94 billion\u00a0(INR 493.2 billion) for FY23, as reported by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. This figure represents a mere\u00a01.5% of its global turnover\u00a0of $383.2 billion.\nApple's production and export strategy in India appears to be in sync with seasonal fluctuations\u00a0and global demand patterns. Exports\u00a0soared\u00a0to 80% of total iPhone\u00a0production in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024, aligning\u00a0with the global launch of\u00a0iPhone 15 and the surge in demand during the festive season\u00a0in the US and Europe.\nBased on projections by JP Morgan, Apple may divert\u00a0up to 25% of its\u00a0total iPhone production to India\u00a0by 2026, indicating a significant overhaul in\u00a0its global supply chain and\u00a0production strategies.\nPhoto Courtesy: Sophia Stark on Unsplash\nRead Next:\u00a0Apple's New 15-Floor Office In Bengaluru Can Accommodate 1,200 Employees And 740 Cars\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Apple Plans Ambitious iPhone Production Ramp Up In India, Targets $12B Value By 2023-24 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to release earnings results for its fiscal first quarter, after the closing bell on Feb. 1, 2024.\nAnalysts expect the iPhone maker to report quarterly earnings at $2.10 per share on revenue of $118.03 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nApple has requested a U.K. tribunal to dismiss a lawsuit worth close to $1 billion. The lawsuit, brought forth by over 1,500 app developers, alleges that Cupertino imposes unfair App Store charges.\nThe company also launched its newest iPhone software update, iOS 17.3, and it comes with several innovative features.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company\u2019s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.49%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple\u2019s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,219,875 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $243,975 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nView more earnings on AAPL\nAlso Read:\u00a0Top 4 Consumer Stocks That May Collapse This Month\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.7% to close at $195.18 on Tuesday.\nRead More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

        "Author": "  Blake Brittain ",
        "Text": "By Blake Brittain\n(Reuters) -A U.S. law enforcement agency has determined that Apple can use a redesign to bypass an import ban on newer Apple Watch models stemming from its patent infringement dispute with Masimo, the medical-monitoring technology company said in a court filing on Monday.\nThe import ban, issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), applies to Apple's current Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches and initially went into effect on Dec. 26. Apple convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to pause the ban the next day, and has since resumed selling the watches as it contests the import ruling.\nApple had said that a proposed redesign would allow it to circumvent findings that the watches infringe Masimo's blood-oxygen reading pulse oximetry patents. Apple has not publicly described the redesign, which could involve an update to the watches' software.\nAccording to Masimo's filing on Monday with the Federal Circuit, Apple told the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency that its redesigned watches \"definitively do not contain pulse oximetry functionality.\" Apple's filings with U.S. Customs and the agency's decision, issued Friday, have not been released publicly.\n\"Apple's claim that its redesigned watch does not contain pulse oximetry is a positive step toward accountability,\" a Masimo spokesperson said on Monday.\nApple said on Monday that Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches with blood-oxygen reading capabilities are still available.\nIrvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology to use in Apple Watches after discussing a potential collaboration.\nApple has included a pulse oximeter feature in smartwatches since its Series 6 Apple Watch in 2020.\nMasimo sued Apple in California that year, alleging that Apple stole trade secrets related to technology for reading blood-oxygen levels and infringed Masimo patents.\nApple countersued Masimo for patent infringement, calling Masimo's legal actions a \"maneuver to clear a path\" for a competing smartwatch. Masimo released its W1 watch, which tracks blood-oxygen levels and other health indicators, in 2022.\nMasimo asked the ITC in 2021 to bar Apple's imports and sales of Apple Watches that allegedly infringed its patents. The ITC ruled for Masimo last year and the ban went into effect in December. Apple briefly stopped sales of its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the United States before Christmas due to the ITC decision, though they remained available from other U.S. retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart. The tech giant resumed selling the watches Dec. 27 after the Federal Circuit said it would pause the ban while it considers whether Apple's appeal should put the ITC's decision on hold.\nApple said on Monday that the appeal would likely take at least a year, and that it expects a decision on its request to keep the ban paused during that time as early as Tuesday.\nThe Federal Circuit is still considering whether to continue the pause or reinstate the ban, which would apply to Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches with pulse oximetry technology that do not have the redesign.\nApple has argued that it is likely to win the appeal and that allowing the ban to stay in effect would cause significant harm to the company, its suppliers and the public.\nMasimo has said that maintaining the pause would hurt its business and reputation and \"demoralize\" its scientists and engineers. It also said in its Monday filing that the Customs decision undermines Apple's argument that reinstating the ban would cause the tech giant irreparable harm.\n(Reporting by Blake Brittain in WashingtonEditing by David Bario, Alexia Garamfalvi and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will begin selling versions of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches without a blood oxygen feature in the US, following a legal setback in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nChina Weighs Stock Market Rescue Package Backed by $278 Billion\nIndia Tops Hong Kong as World\u2019s Fourth-Largest Stock Market\nAn Isolated Israel Doubles Down on War in Gaza \u2014 At All Costs\nNetflix Pays $5 Billion for \u2018Raw\u2019 in Bet on Live Events\nHong Kong Stocks at 36% Discount Show True Depth of China Gloom\nThe company said Wednesday that the tweaked models will go on sale Thursday at its retail outlets and online store. The new models will still include the blood oxygen monitoring tool, but it won\u2019t function.\nEarlier in the day, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declined to grant Apple a longer pause on an import ban of the devices imposed by the US International Trade Commission. The ruling means the company has to stop selling the watches with the oxygen measurement feature while an appeal of the ban plays out \u2014 a period that Apple believes could last a year or more.\nThat led Apple to take the unusual step of removing a key feature from its devices. Last week, the US Customs and Border Protection agency approved redesigned versions of the watches that didn\u2019t have the capability.\n\u201cPending the appeal, Apple is taking steps to comply with the ruling while ensuring customers have access to Apple Watch with limited disruption,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cApple\u2019s appeal is ongoing, and we believe the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit should reverse the USITC\u2019s decision. We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting orders.\u201d\nThe company added that the feature remains available on models sold outside the US. Previously purchased watches also will retain the ability to check blood oxygen levels.\nMasimo shares jumped 2.1% to $122.57 following the decision, reaching their highest level since August. Chief Executive Officer Joe Kiani said in a statement that the development is a \u201cvictory for the integrity of the American patent system.\u201d\nKiani added that the decision \u201caffirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American inventors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others\u2019 patents.\u201d\nThe court battle has threatened one of Apple\u2019s biggest moneymakers in its home market, an unprecedented situation for the tech giant. The watches are a central piece of the company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories division, a business that generated more than 10% of revenue last year, or nearly $40 billion.\nThe ITC ruled in October that Apple\u2019s latest watches violate patents related to blood oxygen measurement, an area known as pulse oximetry. That led Apple to pause sales of the smartwatches just ahead of Christmas, though an interim stay allowed the company to bring the products back late last month.\nRead More: Apple Watch Saga Set in Motion by Late-Night Email to Cook\nAccording to the ITC, the harm Apple said it would face from the ban \u201cis not unquantifiable, but rather speculative.\u201d Apple maintains that the ruling from the ITC is erroneous and should be reversed.\nMasimo had urged the Federal Circuit to reject the request for an extended delay, arguing Apple had almost three years to anticipate a ban and \u201ccannot complain about the consequences of its own failure to prepare for exclusion.\u201d\nApple pushed back on the ITC\u2019s and Masimo\u2019s arguments that its ability to continue selling the noninfringing Apple Watch SE means any reputational harm from the ban can\u2019t be truly irreparable.\nIt also criticized the product that the trade dispute was launched to protect, Masimo\u2019s W1 watch, saying it didn\u2019t exist when Masimo filed its complaint, wasn\u2019t placed in the consumer channel and is sold only in negligible quantities \u201cwell over two years after this investigation began on the false premise that Masimo had an established domestic industry.\u201d\nThe appeals court said in a brief order Wednesday, \u201cWe reach no conclusion on the merits of the appeal.\u201d The panel said the temporary stay will expire at 5 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday.\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, added the blood oxygen sensor to its watches in 2020 with the Series 6. Masimo, a medical device company, sued Apple that year, alleging that the iPhone maker violated several of its health technology patents and stole its trade secrets.\nThe case is Apple Inc. v.

We should see valuations normalize to average levels, if not above-average levels.\n\"And that is the reason why investors should be pretty optimistic about small gains.\"\nApple stock was up nearly 3% on Thursday an upgrade from Bank of America.\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: \nAfter a string of downgrades from Wall Street analysts, Apple\u2019s (AAPL) stock received a much-needed vote of confidence on Thursday as Bank of America (BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan upgraded the bank\u2019s position on the company and raised its price target.

The first new product category for the company since it launched the Apple Watch, the $3,499 Vision Pro will serve as a test for Apple\u2019s ability to produce a new kind of device for what could be the next generation of computing.\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers pages on Thursday afternoon following its latest quarterly earnings release. The company topped Wall Street's estimates for earnings per share and projected revenue will grow 20% in 2024 driven by artificial intelligence demand.\nShares of Apple (AAPL) increased nearly 3% after Bank of America upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral.

And since the data comes from the internet, the material includes copyrighted works from creators who never consented for their content to be part of the training set. Some major publishers have agreed to license their content to AI companies. But others, including the New York Times, have sued AI companies for copyright infringement.\nHow courts will apply legacy copyright law to new AI technologies is perhaps the biggest challenge facing businesses like OpenAI.\nAltman said during the interview that \"any one particular training source doesn't move the needle for us that much.\" For OpenAI and others, a model where publishers opt out of the training process, excluding their content from the development process, is one way for creators to protect themselves.\nBut Altman also envisions a new paradigm of smaller pools of data and one in which creators are compensated for helping to inspire AI tools. \"We wont need the same massive amounts of training data,\" he said. \"But what we want in any case is to find new economic models that work for the whole world including content owners.\"\nHe added: \"If you teach our models, if you help provide the human feedback, I'd love to find new models for you to get paid based off the success of that.\"\nMortgage rates' recent decline continued in data released on Thursday.\nYahoo Finance's Rebecca Chen reports: \nThe average rate for a 30-year loan dropped to 6.60% from 6.66% a week prior, according to Freddie Mac on Thursday.

However, as purchase demand continues to thaw, it will put more pressure on already depleted inventory for sale.\u201d\nPlug Power (PLUG) shares tumbled as much as 16% on Thursday after the hydrogen fuel cell developer announced a potential $1 billion stock offering plan.\nThe capital raise comes about two months after the Latham, N.Y.-based company issued a \"going concern\" notice regarding its potential inability to fund operations over the next year.\nOn Thursday Morningstar analysts noted, \"This hints that the company may be experiencing difficulty in arranging other financing solutions at reasonable terms.\"\nDuring the company's third quarter earnings call last November, Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh said, \"This was a difficult quarter.\"\nHe added, \"Over the past several months, there have been enormous challenges associated with the availability of hydrogen, primarily due to downed plants, including our Tennessee facility, and temporary plant outages across the entire hydrogen network.\"\nPlug Power shares were down 12%, trading at around $2.40 each at 11:30 a.m. Eastern.

The results were higher than the forecast of 1.425 million units from economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nAuthorized residential permits \u2014 an indicator of future activity \u2014 rose 1.9% to a rate of 1.495 million units in December, up from November's revised rate of 1.467 million units. This beat forecasts for a rate of 1.477 million units, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\"Most of the drop in housing starts reflects the partial reversal of the spike in November single-family starts, but the less-volatile permits numbers suggest that the steady uptrend in single-family construction will continue,\" Kieran Clancy, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote following the release.\nStarts on multifamily structures with five or more units landed at 417,000 for December, slightly higher than the previous month's 404,000 units. Permits to start construction on multiple properties with five or more units reached 449,000 units in December, a 3.2% increase from the previous month.\n\"The fall on the month [for housing starts] was something of a surprise to us given that November\u2019s strength was caused by it being an unseasonably warm and dry month, and last month was the warmest December on record,\" wrote Thomas Ryan, property economist at Capital Economics.\n\"Looking ahead to this year, we don\u2019t think mortgage rates will fall enough to unwind mortgage rate 'lock-in' and cause a meaningful recovery in supply,\" Ryan added. \"Against that backdrop, demand will continue to get diverted to newbuilds, which will also encourage stronger construction activity.\"\nMarkets had been in search of a catalyst that wasn't macroeconomic data, and it appears the tech sector has once again stepped in with good news to lift the broader averages.\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) took the lead role on Thursday as the chipmaker, which supplies to the likes of Apple (APPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported quarterly results before the opening bell that beat estimates.\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 came in higher than Wall Street's expectations for $1.38. And, perhaps more importantly, the chipmaker said artificial intelligence is fueling its success. Taiwan Semiconductor said it expects revenue to grow 20% in 2024 due in part to AI demand.\nThe news sent the semiconductor index (^SOX) nearly 3% higher while market bellwether Nvidia shot up over 2%. This came as an upgrade on Apple (AAPL) stock from Bank of America sent shares of the iPhone maker nearly 3% higher.\nTo Keith Lerner, the co-chief investment officer at Truist, news like Thursday's is still key to driving the market higher given tech's outsized weight in the major averages.\n\"With the concentration that you still have, I think, tech showing the earnings and the ability to grow earnings at a good pace, even if we have a step down in growth, is very important to keep this market moving forward,\" Lerner told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday ahead of tech earnings.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) added around 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains, rising 1% in morning trade.\nUS stocks tipped higher on Thursday, eyeing a rebound from recent losses as investors looked to fresh quarterly earnings for inspiration amid dwindling hopes for an early 2024 interest rate cut.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) added around 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains, rising 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 0.3%.\nTechs led stocks higher after a bullish AI-fueled revenue outlook from TSMC (TSM), a key supplier to Apple (APPL) and Nvidia (NVDA). The Taiwanese contract chipmaker's profit fell but beat Wall Street estimates. Shares of AMD (AMD) and other chipmakers stepped higher as TSMC put on almost 7%.\nWeekly jobless claims hit their lowest level in more than a year last week despite concerns over slowing in the labor market to start 2024.\nFresh data from the Department of Labor showed 187,000 unemployment claims were filed last week. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected 208,000 claims.\n\"Most labor market indicators show progress toward a rebalancing in supply and demand, but that is happening without a rise in layoffs, with initial jobless claims falling to their lowest level since September 2022,\" Oxford Economics US economist Matthew Martin wrote in a note to clients. \"Though seasonal factors overstate the drop, the low levels of claims suggest vacancies rather than employment continue to bear the burden of softening labor demand.\"\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) will release the new Vision Pro headset in the US on Feb. 2, the company announced Monday, in what CEO Tim Cook has described as the dawn of spatial computing.\nCustomers can pick up the headset, which sells for $3,499 with 256GB of storage, at US Apple Store locations and the online store. Preorders for the device will begin on Jan. 19, the company said.\nApple shares rose 1.3% during morning trading, steering the stock toward a win after a bruising week.\nThe official release of the VR and augmented reality headset marks a significant moment for the company as consumers will soon get their hands on Apple's biggest product launch in roughly a decade.\n\u201cThe era of spatial computing has arrived,\u201d said Cook in a statement. \u201cApple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore.\u201d\nApple's highly anticipated expansion of its hardware lineup comes at a challenging moment for the tech giant. Cupertino is coming off a brutal week in which traders erased more than $175 billion in market value after two analyst downgrades sparked a punishing sell-off.\nApple's stock is closely watched because, as the market's most valuable company, it accounts for a significant percentage of the benchmark S&P 500 index, and the company's financial performance can influence the broader stock market. Due to Apple's enormous user base and its operations in crucial markets like China, the company also acts as a health gauge of the global economy.\nThe headset, in particular, is a test for Apple charting a new path as older hardware categories, most notably the iPhone, have reached maturity.\nApple's more critical observers have framed cooling demand for its devices as a sign of the company's slow demise. Its bullish backers, however, contend that Wall Street underestimates the pull of Apple's devices. They also highlight Apple's massive potential to grow its services business. Dan Ives of Wedbush, a prominent Apple optimist, estimates that Apple's services segment alone is worth a staggering $1.6 trillion.\nThe Vision Pro runs on a new operating system, dubbed visionOS, featuring a new three-dimensional user interface and inputs controlled by a user\u2019s eyes, hands, and voice. Apple's device will go head-to-head against Meta's (META) Quest headsets, pitting one American tech giant against another as Silicon Valley attempts to sell augmented and virtual reality as tech's next frontier, alongside the rapid development of generative AI.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "After a string of downgrades from Wall Street analysts, Apple\u2019s (AAPL) stock received a much-needed vote of confidence on Thursday as Bank of America (BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan upgraded the bank\u2019s position on the company and raised its price target. Shares of Apple were up nearly 3% as of midday Thursday.\nIn a research note, Mohan upgraded Apple from Neutral to Buy and increased its price objective from $208 to $225. Mohan said the company stands to benefit from a number of industry trends, as well as a glut of users who are using older iPhones and will need to upgrade to newer models in the coming years.\nSpecifically, Mohan says that he expects a \u201cstronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by need for the latest hardware to enable Generative AI features to be introduced in 2024/2025.\u201d He also expects to see better growth in the company\u2019s services business and said risks around potential legal issues Apple could face are \u201cmanageable.\u201d\nApple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet: the Vision Pro headset. The first new product category for the company since it launched the Apple Watch, the $3,499 Vision Pro will serve as a test for Apple\u2019s ability to produce a new kind of device for what could be the next generation of computing.\nIn a recent hands-on with the Vision Pro, Engadget\u2019s Dana Wollman and Cherlynn Low praised the device\u2019s technological capabilities and fun factor, but criticized its floating keyboard. I was blown away by the Vision Pro when I first tested it out in June during Apple\u2019s WWDC event. It\u2019s easily the best headset out there, but the price is going to be a tough sell for the average consumer.\nMohan, however, says that as spatial computing takes hold, the Vision Pro could outpace Apple\u2019s iPad revenue. The company\u2019s iPad business generated $28.3 billion in 2023 compared to the $200.6 billion generated by iPhone sales.\nMohan\u2019s upgrade follows downgrades on Apple\u2019s stock at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic. Analysts at each of the firms pointed to slowing iPhone sales, especially in China, as a major headwind for the tech giant.\nGreater China is Apple\u2019s third-largest region by revenue behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company\u2019s $383.3 billion in total revenue.\nChina could be particularly irksome for Apple, as the company faces increased competition from homegrown tech companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. Huawei in particular has managed to regain its strength in the smartphone market after US sanctions nearly crushed the company.\nApple\u2019s biggest smartphone rival, Samsung, meanwhile announced its new Galaxy S24 lineup on Wednesday. The phones, which go on sale Jan. 31 and range in price from $799 for the Galaxy S24 to $1,299 for the S24 Ultra, all come with generative AI capabilities including translation functions, AI for photo editing, and more. If Apple is going to compete on an equal level with its Android counterpart, it\u2019ll need to introduce some kind of generative AI capabilities with its next iPhone in September.\nFor now, though, it\u2019s all about the iPhone 15 and Vision Pro. We\u2019ll find out more about how the iPhone 15 is performing and perhaps get an outlook for the Vision Pro when Apple announces its first quarter earnings on Feb. 1.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article listed an incorrect prior price target for Apple.

The drop was jarring enough to overshadow otherwise strong results, which included Apple\u2019s first overall sales growth in a year.\nBut the signs of trouble in China have been accumulating for months. The country\u2019s government imposed stricter bans on the use of foreign technology in the workplace. Local rival Huawei Technologies Co. released a hot new smartphone touted as a local alternative to the iPhone. And Apple began offering rare discounts on its latest models.\nRead More: Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?\nSales of iPads and wearable technology have been particularly weak in the country, adding up to a bleak picture. The company also warned that iPhone growth in the current quarter won\u2019t be as strong as Wall Street anticipated, forcing analysts to rethink their projections. They went through a similar exercise with Apple\u2019s previous earnings three months earlier.\n\u201cWe believe expectations need to move lower, yet again,\u201d Brandon Nispel, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.\nChina\u2019s importance to Apple goes beyond its status as the company\u2019s third-largest market by revenue. It\u2019s the country where Apple produces the vast majority of its devices, but also a tantalizing growth opportunity thanks to its 1.4 billion people and expanding middle class.\nOn a conference call with analysts Thursday, executives said their faith in China wasn\u2019t shaken. Apple\u2019s installed base is still growing, and current customers continue to upgrade their devices, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. Still, iPhone revenue fell by a percentage in the mid-single digits when holding currency rates constant.\n\u201cI remain very optimistic about China over the long term,\u201d Cook said.\nChief Financial Officer Luca Maestri described the phone sector in China as the \u201cmost competitive market in the world.\u201d And Apple isn\u2019t the only player struggling to grow. Several of the top mobile makers saw shipments decrease last quarter, according to IDC. In fact, Apple took first place in the market because it didn\u2019t shrink as much as others, the research firm said.\nRead More: iPhone Takes Top Spot in China for First Time Despite Challenges\nBut Huawei has bucked the downward trend. The company \u2014 blacklisted by the US over national security concerns \u2014 saw shipments surge 36% in China. That vaulted it to fourth place.\nThe technology company launched the Mate 60 Pro phone last year just before the iPhone 15 went on sale. The Huawei device, which runs on Chinese-made chips, is benefiting from a renewed wave of nationalism in the country.\nThat\u2019s led to countermeasures. Last month, Apple began offering discounts of as much as 500 yuan ($70) on the iPhone 15 \u2014 a step it doesn\u2019t usually have to take. The markdown was equivalent to about 5% off its top-of-the-line model.\nA resurgent Huawei and other manufacturers are posing a bigger threat than before, said Ivan Lam, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. In some cases, consumers are buying those brands rather than older iPhone 13 and 14 models, he said.\n\u201cThis is a competitive issue,\u201d Lam said.\n--With assistance from Charlotte Yang.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About\nThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

Police have identified multiple suspects via that method, the agency said, without disclosing if anyone was arrested.\n\u201cIt improves the efficiency and accuracy of case-solving and prevents the spread of inappropriate remarks as well as potential bad influences,\u201d the bureau said.\nThe declaration again drew attention to an iPhone feature that activists around the world have employed to spread their message.

Pre-orders begin Jan. 19, but buyers will have to go to a store to be properly fitted for the goggles, which are controlled with the eyes and a few simple hand gestures.\nAlthough Facebook owner Meta Platforms and other companies have been making virtual reality headsets for years with limited success, many industry analysts believe Apple has the potential to expand the technology's audience beyond the video gamers and mostly tech nerds that have embraced it so far.\nThe Vision Pro already has gotten largely enthusiastic reviews among the media who were able to test it in tightly controlled demonstrations monitored by Apple, but the device's price tag probably means relatively few unit sales during its first year on the market.\nEven so, Apple's first new product since its smartwatch debut a decade ago could set the stage for the introduction of more affordable versions for a broader audience. Right now, the Vision Pro will cost seven times more than Meta's latest virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3.\nIn a sign that Apple is expecting the Vision Pro to pave the way to a bigger market, the company included the ability to take 3-D videos that can be viewed through the goggles on its its latest premium iPhones, the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. These videos are so realistic that the people and other images in them appear to be right in front of the viewer watching them.\nApple is looking for ways to juice its sales after suffering a slight decline in revenue during its last fiscal year ending in in September. Apple still raked in $383 billion in sales, with the iPhone accounting for more than half that amount.\n"

        "Title": "Better Tech Stock: Alphabet vs. Apple",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The tech industry is vast, encompassing everything from consumer products like smartphones and video game consoles to artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, and a whole lot more. It has earned a reputation for rewarding innovative companies and their investors with consistent and significant gains over the long term, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector up more than 150% since 2019.\nAs a result, it's no surprise many stockholders have dedicated substantial portions of their portfolios to the high-growth market. In fact, Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathway has invested nearly 50% of its portfolio in tech stocks, enjoying a 20% compound annual gain between 1965 and 2022.\nSo, it's not a bad idea to expand your position in tech and add some new companies to your list of holdings. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive options, among the most prominent names in the industry.\nLet's look at these two businesses and determine whether Alphabet or Apple is currently the better tech stock.\nAlphabet enjoyed a stellar growth year in 2023, delivering significant gains in its digital ad business and strengthening its position in AI.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Alphabet posted revenue growth of 11% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by $980 million. The rise was mainly due to improvements in its advertising segments, represented by an 11% increase in Google Search revenue and 12% growth from YouTube ads.\nThe digital ad market is projected to hit $740 billion in 2024, with Alphabet responsible for about 25% of that. Popular brands like Google, Android, and YouTube attract billions of users, presenting almost endless advertising opportunities. Meanwhile, their popularity will likely prove useful as Alphabet expands in AI.\nLast month, the company unveiled its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini. The new model is expected to be competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4 and could bolster Alphabet's venture in the market. With Gemini, Alphabet could create a more dynamic Google Search experience, more efficiently analyze video trends on YouTube, and improve its various productivity services.\nAlphabet's free cash flow rose 29% over the last year to $77 billion. Alongside a powerful position in tech, the company has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and deliver significant growth over the long term.\nApple seemed to hit roadblock after roadblock last year. Its revenue dipped 3% year over year in fiscal 2023 as macroeconomic headwinds caught up with its business and led to declines in product sales.\nThen, toward the end of 2023, the company was forced to pull its latest Apple Watches from U.S. shelves due to potential patent infringements. Meanwhile, the Chinese government increased restrictions on workers using iPhones. As a result, the tech giant is starting 2024 with its work cut out for it.\nHowever, it's not all bad news. Apple's digital services segment, the second-highest-earning part of its business, has remained a bright spot. Services posted revenue growth of 9% for the fiscal year, significantly outperforming all other segments.\nMeanwhile, Apple still achieved nearly $100 billion in free cash flow in 2023, proving it can overcome current headwinds and invest in its research and development. The company has some exciting developments in 2024, including venturing into the virtual/augmented reality market for the first time with a new headset and a gradual expansion in AI.\nApple remains one of the biggest names in tech, and I wouldn't bet against its long-term success.\nAlphabet and Apple are leaders in their respective industries and are part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech companies for a reason. However, just because a company dominates a market doesn't necessarily mean it's the right time to buy its stock.\nThese charts show Alphabet is the cheaper option based on three different valuation metrics. The Google parent's lower figures suggest its stock currently offers far more value than Apple. Alongside a better performance in 2023 and a firmer position in the rapidly expanding AI market, Alphabet is the better tech stock this month.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "US Supreme Court declines to wade into Apple's dispute with Epic Games",
        "Author": " Alexis Keenan    and Daniel Howley    ",
        "Text": "The US Supreme Court declined to take up dueling appeals from Apple (AAPL) and \u201cFortnite\u201d developer Epic Games.\nIn an order issued Tuesday, the court announced it would not grant either of the two appeals that asked the justices to reconsider a ruling that impacts Apple\u2019s control over its lucrative App Store. As a result, an appellate court ruling mostly favoring Apple, though requiring it to make some changes, will stand.\nIn the appeals case, the Ninth Circuit upheld a California trial court's ruling, holding that while the trial court erred in its analysis, Epic nonetheless failed to show that Apple held an illegal monopoly in a relevant market.\nConsequently, the court said, the tech giant did not violate federal antitrust law \u2014 a result that spared Apple from having to break up or divest its closely guarded App Store.\nThe decision isn't all upside for Apple, however. The Ninth Circuit's ruling revives an injunction that requires the smart phone behemoth to allow developers to include links and buttons in their apps that direct users to pay for app purchases outside the App Store.\nThe injunction puts billions in revenue in jeopardy for Apple. The company, which holds roughly 15% of the global smartphone market, earns fees on in-app purchases created by more than 30 million iOS app developers. The Ninth Circuit said at the time of Epic's trial against Apple that the number of video games on Apple's operating mobile system had grown from 131 in the early days of the iPhone to over 300,000. These gaming apps, the court said, generated an estimated $100 billion in annual revenue.\nThe appeals court said Epic failed in its case by not adequately showing that Apple's App Store qualified as a relevant app market. The court went on to say that Epic also failed to introduce some substantially less restrictive means by which Apple could maintain its iOS ecosystem.\nIn a minor win for Epic, the Ninth Circuit also let stand US District Court Judge Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s determination that Apple had violated California\u2019s Unfair Competition law. To remedy the violation, the court ordered Apple to allow Epic and other app developers offer alternative in-app payment methods.\nEpic had hoped the Supreme Court would take up its broader claim that developers should be able to get their apps onto iPhones through third-party app stores in addition to Apple's App Store.\nWhile the Supreme Court's decision not to hear Epic's appeal helps Apple by ensuring it keeps its App Store intact, the court's decision not to hear Apple's appeal could seriously bruise the tech giant. Apple benefits handsomely from the 15% and 30% fees it charges app developers on the sale of products through its App Store when using Apple's payment service.\nIf app developers can offer their own payment options in apps, they can bypass Apple's fees, cutting into the company's App Store revenue. Developers could sweeten the deal for consumers by selling apps and in-app products at a discount, since they won't have to make up for Apple's fees any longer.\nApple doesn't break out its App Store revenue numbers, but rather includes them as part of the company's overall services business. That segment, which also includes subscriptions for products like Apple TV+ and Apple Care, generated $85.2 billion of Apple's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.\nThe Epic-Apple dispute began more than two years ago when \u201cFortnite,\u201d with about 350 million registered players, was booted from Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) app stores and banned from their operating systems.\nThe bans were a response to Epic\u2019s gaming program, which circumvented the platforms by offering direct in-game purchases at a 20% discount. Apple and Google both said the move violated their terms of service, justifying removal from the stores.\nEpic then filed separate lawsuits against Google and Apple with nearly identical allegations that the removals violated federal and California antitrust laws.\nWhile the two cases center on what level of control tech giants should have over the third-party developers, a jury came to an opposite conclusion in the case that went forward against Google.\nIn a jury trial, jurors sided with Epic, finding that Google had abused the dominance of its Android operating system app distribution and in-app billing markets by extracting exorbitant fees from Epic and other third-party app makers. A separate portion of the trial to determine a remedy for the violation is scheduled to take place later in January. A final outcome, however, is likely years away, as Google is expected to appeal the case.\nWhile Apple prohibits users from installing apps on their iPhones from outside the App Store, Google's Android lets users install apps from third-party app stores, albeit after forcing them to make changes in their device's settings menu and read a warning about doing so.\nApple's App Store is facing pressure from governments around the globe. Regulators from South Korea and Japan to the UK and EU have or are looking into ways to make the iPhone maker open up its devices to allow third-party app stores on its devices or provide alternative payment options in apps.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to not take up the Epic and Apple appeals could also impact the US Justice Department\u2019s ongoing investigation into Apple\u2019s App Store and other business lines.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is shutting a 121-person team related to artificial intelligence operations in San Diego, leaving many employees at risk of termination, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip\nStocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap\nApple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback\nJPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year\nDimon Says China Risk-Reward Equation Has \u2018Changed Dramatically\u2019\nThe group, known as Data Operations Annotations, was told Wednesday that they would be relocating to Austin to merge with the Texas portion of the same team, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven\u2019t been announced.\nApple told employees that they have until the end of February to decide if they will relocate, according to the people. If they don\u2019t, the workers will be terminated on April 26.\nThe group, which also has offices in China, India, Ireland and Spain, is responsible for improving Siri by listening to queries to the voice service and determining if it heard and handled questions accurately. The announcement to close the San Diego group was made by Christine DeFilippo, a top deputy to Apple AI chief John Giannandrea, the people said.\nAn Apple spokeswoman confirmed the relocation decision, saying the company is bringing its \u201cData Operations Annotations teams in the US together at our campus in Austin, where a majority of the team is already based.\u201d She added that \u201ceveryone currently employed will have the opportunity to continue their role with Apple in Austin.\u201d\nThe company also said it\u2019s \u201cdeeply committed to San Diego,\u201d where it has \u201cgrown significantly,\u201d and that it is continuing to hire as Apple expands its engineering teams. In other countries where the affected team operates, Apple keeps all the employees in one office.\nFor the San Diego staff, the move came as a surprise. The AI team had been working from an office that Apple is renting, according to the people. But the company had told staff recently that they would be relocated to a new Apple campus in the area at the end of January. Earlier this month, Apple distributed packing boxes to employees to prepare for a relocation within the city.\nInstead, they\u2019ll now have to move to Texas. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the majority of affected workers have indicated that they\u2019re unwilling to relocate to Austin. Apple told employees that they could apply for other jobs, but some don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be eligible for many roles because they don\u2019t have engineering backgrounds, the people said.\nThe San Diego employees focused on Siri use in Hebrew, English, multiple dialects of Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and French.\nThe move has the potential to result in several dozen workers leaving the company. Apple, which had 161,000 employees as of September, has mostly managed to avoid layoffs since the pandemic \u2014 in contrast with most of its tech peers. It did, however, cut some corporate retail jobs last April, as well as recruiters.\nEmployees who are willing to relocate to Austin by the end of June will be able keep their roles, Apple said. The company is offering $7,000 relocation stipends. Those who choose to leave Apple will see their roles eliminated and get four weeks of severance \u2014 plus an additional week for every year worked. They\u2019ll also get six months of health insurance.\nThe team has a notable history within Apple. Years ago, the group was mostly made up of contractors who listened to Siri queries to ensure their accuracy. That practice raised privacy concerns and was made optional for customers in 2019. The contractors ended up being fired and replaced with full-time employees.\nA small number of employees in the group have begun assisting Apple with a move to AI products based on large language models, or LLMs. These employees are now reviewing potential queries to Siri and choosing among a handful of answers. They then have to explain their decision. Apple is planning to announce its LLM plans in June, Bloomberg News has reported.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJapan\u2019s Market Roars Back to Life\u2014With Old-Timers Leading the Way\nElon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla\nThere\u2019s a Toxic Employee\u2014and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue\nChinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares settled lower on Tuesday, Jan. 2, after Barclays downgraded its rating on the stock.\nBarclays analyst Tim Long downgraded the stock from Equal-Weight to Underweight and lowered the price target from $161 to $160.\nThe analyst slightly lowered his AAPL estimates following another round of checks. He still picks up weakness in iPhone volumes and mix and a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads, and wearables.\nApple is now reportedly expected to launch its futuristic $3,500 Vision Pro headset in the last week of January, accelerating the launch timeline from February.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company\u2019s dividends too. As of now, the Cupertino, California-based company offers an annual dividend yield of 0.52%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,160,250 or around 6,250 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $232,050 or around 1,250 shares.\nRead This:  $1M Bet On This Healthcare Stock? Check Out These 3 Penny Stocks Insiders Are Aggressively Buying \nTo Calculate:  Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.68 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works:  The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 3.6% to close at $185.64 on Tuesday.\nRead More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

YouTube, like Netflix, is recommending that customers use a web browser if they want to see its content: \u201cYouTube users will be able to use YouTube in Safari on the Vision Pro at launch.\u201d\nSpotify also isn\u2019t currently planning a new app for visionOS \u2014 the Vision Pro\u2019s operating system \u2014 and doesn\u2019t expect to enable its iPad app to run on the device when it launches, according to a person familiar with matter. But the music service will still likely work from a web browser. Bloomberg News reported on Netflix\u2019s decision Wednesday.\nThe Vision Pro will include access to Apple\u2019s apps for music and podcasts, which compete with Spotify\u2019s offerings. But getting snubbed by Netflix, Spotify and YouTube means that the most popular streaming apps won\u2019t be available when the headset launches on Feb. 2. Apple has largely marketed the device as a platform for video, games and other entertainment.\nYouTube is a particularly large omission for the product. When Apple\u2019s original iPad launched in 2010, YouTube was one of a handful of apps preinstalled on the tablet. The company didn\u2019t rule out eventually supporting the Vision Pro but said it had \u201cno further plans to share at this time.\u201d\nYouTube and Spotify continue to offer popular apps for the iPhone and iPad. And that, theoretically, gave them an easy path toward supporting the Vision Pro. Developers with iPad software in the regular App Store will see those apps appear in the Vision Pro store by default. That means developers have to opt out if they don\u2019t want to participate.\nSeveral other entertainment apps are still participating, including Disney+, Max, Peacock, ESPN and Amazon Prime Video. Altogether, Apple says the device will support more than 1 million titles in the headset\u2019s App Store. The company will begin taking preorders for the Vision Pro on Friday.\nYouTube and Spotify declined to say why they bowed out of supporting the $3,499 device. Spotify doesn\u2019t offer an app on competing headsets, such as Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Quest, though YouTube does. Spotify also has been embroiled in a fight with Apple over App Store policies, but the decision on the Vision Pro isn\u2019t related to that, according to the person familiar, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.\nSearches conducted by MacStories on Thursday indicated that other key iPhone and iPad apps, including Meta\u2019s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, aren\u2019t currently set to work on the Vision Pro either. But that could change by the device\u2019s launch, or those developers could be planning new dedicated versions for visionOS. Meta didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nApple\u2019s executive in charge of the Vision Pro told employees this week that he expects health care, technician training and education to eventually become key areas for the product. The company also is studying corporate applications, Bloomberg News reported Thursday.\nThe Vision Pro represents Apple\u2019s first major new product category since it began selling smartwatches in 2015.\n--With assistance from Julia Love and Kurt Wagner.\n(Updated with more on Vision Pro launch in 11th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHong Kong\u2019s High Rents Create a New Type of Cross-Border Commuter\nIt\u2019s the Tesla Earnings Call\u2014Time for Elon Musk Bingo\nHow Sweden Quit Smoking Without Quitting Nicotine\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.\nGoldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited \u2014 or something in between.\nApple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.\nWith the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.\nThe purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn\u2019t comment on the sales performance of new products.\nWall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that\u2019s \u201cimmaterial.\u201d\nRead More: Apple Headset Lacks Blockbuster Buzz Needed to Energize Shares\nStill, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset \u2014 making it cheaper and more comfortable \u2014 and find compelling applications for the device.\nIn the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it\u2019s under particular pressure in China. The company\u2019s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters \u2014 its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.\nInitially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.\nIt\u2019s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren\u2019t too tight.\nInside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever \u2014 about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.\nThe Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals \u2014 a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer\u2019s field of view \u2014 in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.\nAnd the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.\nAnother concern that\u2019s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google\u2019s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.\nBut Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they\u2019ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls \u201cspatial computing.\u201d\nTo commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.\nA key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn\u2019t have a closed-in feel \u2014 a complaint with VR headsets.\n\u201cFrom the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.\u201d\nThat led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer\u2019s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. \u201cIt was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,\u201d Rockwell said.\nApple also developed an interface that doesn\u2019t require handheld accessories.

        "Author": "  Dana Blankenhorn ",
        "Text": "Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), stock has long been seen as a cheap proxy for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), its largest customer. When sales are growing fast, analysts love to talk about Skyworks (which makes radio chips) getting away from that dependence. When growth is slow it hugs that dependence tight.\nFor SWKS stock, 2023 was a tough year. It had $685 million in sales to Apple, representing 64% of revenue. About 85% of those chips went into the iPhone. The question for investors is whether that other 36% of sales is worth worrying about.\nWhile Skyworks is a tech stock, you don\u2019t buy it as one. You buy it for the dividend. That dividend jumped from 38 cents/share five years ago to 68 cents last November. If you are a long-term investor, that\u2019s your return. Shares in January were just 23% ahead of where they were in early 2019. We\u2019re talking about single digit annual returns.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSkyworks was much in vogue during the 2021 bull market. Shares traded at over $190 in the middle of that year, but you should have sold. It trades today closer to $105.\nThe highs were marked by public statements that Skyworks was going beyond Apple. You still see such stories, but analysts no longer pay attention to them.\nIn 2021 Skyworks bought Silicon Laboratories, hoping that chips for autos would reduce its Apple dependence. So far, they haven\u2019t.\nWhen they\u2019re not fretting about Skyworks\u2019 dependence on Apple, bears are worried about Apple walking away.\nApple has long focused on supplying its own silicon. Capturing those profits let it grow its bottom line without growth in unit sales. Its focus has mainly been on replacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). But with that work mostly complete it\u2019s now going into its radio sets. This puts Skyworks in the crosshairs alongside Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nPersonally, I downplay those threats. The margins for Broadcom and Qualcomm are much bigger than the 47% Skyworks earns. Qualcomm and Apple have been in court for years. Broadcom is known for pushing its proprietary advantages hard.\nAll that, plus Skyworks\u2019 relatively small size, a market cap of $16.5 billion, tells me Apple should drop it down the priority list.\nSkyworks stock is a big favorite among institutions, who have 84% of the common. Fundamentally, it\u2019s safe, a good long-term holding\nFor the September quarter, Skyworks had GAAP operating income of $254 million, and earnings of $1.52 per share, on revenue of $1.22 billion. For the December quarter, it expects similar results, making the 68 cent per share dividend safe.\nWhat most excited investors last year was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, up 76% from a year ago. CEO Liam Griffin emphasized design wins for Android 5G phones and WiFi 7 base stations.\nIt was enough to keep analysts on-side. There are currently 24 of them, with 9 saying buy it and 2 saying sell.\nNowhere in that quarterly release does Griffin mention AI. That\u2019s interesting because much of Skyworks\u2019 non-Apple growth should come from client devices. Medical devices, wearables, factory robotics, and autos are all subject to AI hype.\nWhile most reporters focus on AI writing stories like this one, growth today is coming from managing fleets of client devices in hospitals, factories and on battlefields. What I call the \u201cMachine Internet\u201d can orchestrate the work of entire institutions, software doing things people have never been capable of.\nThe fact that Skyworks analysts remain focused on the iPhone is telling. If AI isn\u2019t growing in areas where it should grow, might the whole hype machine go off the rails? SWKS stock may not just be a proxy for Apple\u2019s problems, but for AI\u2019s as well.\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in INTC, QCOM and AAPL.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been off to a rough start to 2024. Its shares are down for the first week of the new year as investors have been cashing in after a strong 2023, when the stock jumped by 48%. And analysts have also been raising concerns about the company's growth rate, which is a legitimate worry as the economy potentially heads into a recession this year.\nIs 2024 destined to be a bad year for Apple, and is now the time to sell the stock?\nMultiple brokerages have been lowering their price targets for Apple's stock this year. According to Wall Street, the consensus analyst price target is just under $200, implying an upside of around 8% from where the stock trades at today. In other words, Apple's stock may be approaching a peak.\nThere are multiple reasons analysts are becoming bearish on the stock, and they all inevitably lead back to concerns about a slowing growth rate. Weak demand in China, patent disputes surrounding its Apple Watches, and the stock's high valuation are just some of the reasons the stock may not look so hot right now. Plus, the possibility of a recession this year could strain domestic demand for its products.\nA slowing growth rate isn't new for Apple; it has been a problem for the past couple of years. As interest rates have been rising and consumer budgets have been tightening up, Apple has been seeing a slower rate of growth for its business.\nAAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\nWhile there's no denying the company has a loyal following and strong customer base, that isn't enough to keep the growth rate from falling. And there isn't a big catalyst out there that may prevent the growth rate from deteriorating further. That's problematic, as this is a stock that trades at 30 times earnings, which isn't a cheap valuation. \nWhat may add to problems for investors is Apple's focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and next-gen technology, including its high-priced Vision Pro headsets. \nAt $3,499, the mixed reality headset is the company's first 3D camera as Apple looks to tap into new opportunities for gaming and entertainment. Apple has also been rumored to be working on a chatbot, which some have been calling \"Apple GPT,\" as the company looks to become a bigger player in AI.\nThe challenge here is that there are a growing number of companies making chatbots, and it could be a costly venture for Apple. And investors have already seen tech company Meta Platforms spend billions of dollars investing in the metaverse and virtual reality headsets, initiatives which have done little but drain the company's earnings and cash.\nWhile the hope is that in the long run investing in AI and next-gen headsets can pay off, the risk is that Apple's earnings could deteriorate if it invests too heavily in these ventures as it battles for market share, potentially sending its already high price-to-earnings multiple even higher in the process. For now that hasn't been the case, but it's something investors should watch for, especially if Apple's growth rate continues to fall in future quarters and the company feels the pressure to turn things around.\nThis year could be tough for Apple. The company needs to improve its growth rate, and if it fails to do so, the tech stock may be due for a sell-off. But investors should resist the urge to sell.\nThe good news is that with a strong brand, a devoted customer base, and solid financials, the stock could still make for a great long-term investment. Buying shares of Apple on weakness this year could be an enticing option for investors.\nAlthough 2024 may be a bad year for Apple, the business itself remains strong. I wouldn't be too worried about Apple's stock in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Vision Pro Is a Potential Silver Lining",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company\u2019s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.\nThe Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what\u2019s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.\nThe Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.\nAccording to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled \u2013 a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.\nThere is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.\nApple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple\u2019s success stems from the company\u2019s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.\nToday, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.\nThe relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.\nApple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street\u2019s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.\nThe problem with Apple\u2019s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.\nEven if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple\u2019s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.\nThe highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company\u2019s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.\nApple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple\u2019s prospects, but they\u2019re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here\u2019s what some analysts have said about Apple.\nOn January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock\u2019s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company\u2019s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.\nOn January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank\u2019s best investment ideas.\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.\nLast week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.\nOverall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.\nApple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple\u2019s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": " Kris Holt    \u00b7 Contributing Reporter",
        "Text": "It seems that Apple will be able to bypass an import ban on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 devices and once again sell those products in the US after dropping a key feature. According to a letter to an appeals court judge from Masimo, a company that's been involved in a patent dispute against Apple, the latter can skirt the ban by removing the Blood Oxygen app from Apple Watch units it sells in the US going forward.\nPer the letter, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) determined that \"Apple\u2019s redesign falls outside the scope\" of the International Trade Commission's (ITC) import ban on the two devices. Apple told CBP that its \"Redesigned Watch Products definitively do not contain pulse oximetry functionality.\u201d Other details related to the CBP decision are confidential and, as things stand, \"no public version of the decision exists,\" Masimo's letter states.\nAccording to Reuters, however, the CBP decision may be upended if the ITC disagrees. Apple is said to already have shipped modified Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 units to its US locations, but stores were reportedly told not to open or sell the new versions until getting the green light from higher ups.\nIn October, the ITC upheld a prior ruling that Apple violated Masimo patents concerning blood oxygen functions on the Apple Watch. The ruling led Apple to pause sales of the Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the US through its own website and Apple Stores by Christmas Eve. An emergency interim stay of the ITC ruling in late December enabled Apple to start selling the wearables again in the US.\nAccording to 9to5 Mac, Apple's concession won't affect those who already have an Apple Watch with pulse oximetry features. Apple has offered the Blood Oxygen app on its wearables since it released the Apple Watch Series 6 in 2020. It's possible that Apple will roll out a new version of the Blood Oxygen app to affected units once it resolves the patent problem.\nSoon after Apple said it would stop selling the Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 to adhere to the ITC's order, it was reported that the company's engineers were working feverishly on a software update. Those efforts were said to focus on changes to the Blood Oxygen app and its algorithms to ensure the devices violated Masimo's patents.\nThat said, according to Bloomberg, nixing the app altogether was seen as the quickest (and likely easiest) way to avoid having the ban reinstated, though removing what was once a highly touted feature of the Apple Watch is a significant concession. A federal appeals court could hear an Apple motion to extend the stay (which was granted pending an appeal) on the ban as early as this week.\nIn a statement, a Masimo spokesperson told Engadget that \"Apple's claim that its redesigned watch does not contain pulse oximetry is a positive step toward accountability. It is especially important that one of the world's largest and most powerful companies respects the intellectual property rights of smaller companies and complies with ITC orders when it is caught infringing.\"\nMasimo has claimed that Apple hired its former employees and used its pulse oximetry tech in Apple Watch devices. Apple countersued Masimo, arguing that the company's own smartwatch copies patented Apple Watch features.\nUpdate, January 15, 5:10PM ET: This story was updated after publish to include a statement from Masimo.\n"

The company aims to eventually give consumers a complete picture of their well-being via sensors on different parts of the body and around the home.\nHealth tracking is already a key selling point of smartphones and watches, with Samsung, Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google using the features to attract and retain customers. Creating sensors for continuous blood pressure tracking and glucose monitoring would be particularly valuable breakthroughs. Apple has been working for years on a glucose reader that wouldn\u2019t require users to prick their skin for blood \u2014 a potential boon for millions of diabetics.\n\u201cIf we can do continuous blood pressure and glucose, we\u2019re in a whole different ballgame,\u201d Pak, Samsung\u2019s mobile digital health chief, said during a wide-ranging interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s where everyone is trying to get to. We\u2019re putting significant investment toward that.\u201d\nHe wouldn\u2019t comment on a timeline for either feature, but said he hopes noninvasive glucose monitoring could come to the market in some form within five years. \u201cWe are looking at everything from miniaturization to the various different technology platforms that can do some type of glucose monitoring or anything in between,\u201d Pak said.\nThe remarks follow Samsung\u2019s announcement last week that it\u2019s working on a ring with health sensors. The Galaxy Ring product is scheduled to be released before the end of 2024 and will come in a range of colors and sizes, Pak said. The company is eyeing activity and sleep tracking for the ring, with more health features to come later.\nSmart rings from companies like Oura offer an alternative for people who don\u2019t like to wear a watch but still want to track their health metrics and sleep patterns.\n\u201cThe ring represents that community of people who want health tracking that is more comfortable and less obtrusive,\u201d Pak said. \u201cIt\u2019s meeting a need of a specific population of people who want to track and measure, but in a different way.\u201d\nPak said Samsung hasn\u2019t finalized pricing on the Galaxy Ring, but \u2014 like the company\u2019s Galaxy Watches \u2014 it probably won\u2019t be compatible with Apple\u2019s iPhone.\nDeveloping a blood sugar monitor would be a more challenging task, but one that could have major rewards. Current products on the market typically require a blood draw or a prick in the skin \u2014 an obtrusive process. Apple has been working on a noninvasive approach since around 2010 and has since made major progress, Bloomberg News has reported. Even so, a product remains years away.\nRead More: Apple Has Plans to Eventually, Maybe Revolutionize Health-Care\nThe two companies also are working to improve blood pressure monitoring. Samsung smartwatches have long offered the ability to determine a user\u2019s blood pressure, but the monitoring isn\u2019t constant throughout the day and requires calibration against a standalone blood pressure checker.\nPak said Samsung is \u201cevaluating all options\u201d to improve its blood pressure features. The aim is to go longer without needing calibration. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking long and hard about this,\u201d he said.\nApple, meanwhile, is planning to add hypertension detection to its smartwatch later this year in a way that doesn\u2019t require calibration but also doesn\u2019t provide exact readings. Instead, the watch will inform users that they may have elevated blood pressure. Apple\u2019s expansion into health technology hasn\u2019t gone entirely smoothly. It recently pulled a blood oxygen feature from the Apple Watch after a legal setback in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp.\nPak said traditional blood pressure readings aren\u2019t \u201creally that meaningful\u201d other than showing a range of normal and abnormal. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Apple or others, I think we are trying to redefine blood pressure in a way that it was originally intended, which is: How much cardiovascular risk do you have?\u201d he said.\nSamsung also is exploring a range of different sensors for future versions of its earbuds. The company is studying new ways to measure body temperature and heart rates, adding that the ear is a closer pathway to the heart than the wrist. Data from the ear could be combined with wrist and ambient data to provide users with a more comprehensive picture of their health.\nMixed-reality headsets could be a new frontier for health as well, Pak said. Apple is poised to release its first product in that market next week when the Vision Pro goes on sale for $3,499.\nMeditation and mental health could be key areas for such devices, he said.\n\u201cWe are right now looking at partnerships to address that,\u201d Pak said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.\nHow Sweden Quit Smoking Without Quitting Nicotine\nThe Bitcoin Hype Is Back and About Just as Hollow as Before\nJapan\u2019s Market Roars Back to Life\u2014With Old-Timers Leading the Way\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Samsung, whose shipments slumped double-digits to 226.6 million, came in second, ahead of Chinese device makers like Xiaomi Corp. While Apple has dominated the holiday quarter in recent years, its surge ahead of Samsung over a full year is unprecedented and suggests Apple is weathering an industrywide slump better than rivals.\nApple benefited from aggressive offers that have enticed a shift toward premium devices. It managed to expand shipments in 2023 despite a lukewarm reception late in the year for the iPhone 15 in China \u2014 its biggest international market \u2014 where Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s growing popularity and a widening ban on government use is depressing sales.\nRead More: IPhone Sales in China to Fall Double Digits, Jefferies Says\n\u201cWhile we saw some strong growth from low-end Android players like Transsion and Xiaomi in the second half of 2023, stemming from rapid growth in emerging markets, the biggest winner is clearly Apple,\u201d IDC research director Nabila Popal said. \u201cAll this despite facing increased regulatory challenges and renewed competition from Huawei in China, its largest market. Apple\u2019s ongoing success and resilience is in large part due to the increasing trend of premium devices, which now represent over 20% of the market.\u201d\nThe shift up the smartphone price chain has been driven in part by attractive trade-in offers and interest-free financing, IDC said. Apple was the only player in the global top three to register growth, of 3.7%, but it has not been immune to the wider decline. Sales in China of the latest-generation iPhone are significantly down from its predecessor, with some analyst expecting those drops to deepen.\nPart of Apple\u2019s challenge in the world\u2019s biggest mobile market comes from local tech powerhouse Huawei, which reclaimed some of the market share it lost after US sanctions by releasing the Mate 60 Pro smartphone running on an advanced made-in-China processor. Apple this week introduced rare discounts on the iPhone in the country, of as much as 5% per handset, as it sought to stem further erosion of sales.\n--With assistance from Nick Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.\nHow Sweden Quit Smoking Without Quitting Nicotine\nThe Bitcoin Hype Is Back and About Just as Hollow as Before\nJapan\u2019s Market Roars Back to Life\u2014With Old-Timers Leading the Way\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Better Growth Stock in 2024: Amazon vs. Apple",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The new year is here, and there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the next 12 months. 2023 had a tricky start, coming out of a year where the Nasdaq Composite had plunged 33% amid macroeconomic headwinds. However, the situation is much more positive as we begin 2024.\nIn 2023, the Nasdaq Composite rose 43%, fueled by easing inflation and excitement over burgeoning sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI). The market will probably continue trending up in the coming months, with now an excellent time to consider investing in companies set up to flourish this year and beyond.\nAs titans of their respective industries, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive growth stocks with exciting developments in 2024. Amazon has posted multiple quarters of surging growth in its retail business, while Apple will launch its highly anticipated virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset.\nSo let's look at whether Amazon or Apple is the better growth stock in 2024.\nAmazon has delivered an impressive comeback over the past 12 months after suffering steep declines in its e-commerce business in 2022.\nIn its latest quarter, the third quarter of 2023, the company posted 13% year-over-year revenue growth, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, its North American segment exceeded $4 billion in operating income, significantly improving on the $412 million in losses it reported in the year-ago period.\nThe tech giant owes much of its growth over the past year to various cost-cutting moves, such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, shuttering unprofitable programs such as Amazon Care, and laying off thousands of people. The restructuring saw Amazon's free cash flow rise 427% over the past year to $17 billion.\nAs a result, the company is starting 2024 in excellent form. With lower expenses, it has the funds to fuel its R&D as it continues to expand in AI and overcome potential headwinds.\nAmazon is leading two crucial markets with its e-commerce and cloud computing services, with its business likely to deliver significant gains for years.\nApple didn't have it as easy as Amazon in 2023, as an economic downturn led to consumer pullback and repeated declines in its product sales.\nFor the fiscal year, the company's revenue fell 3% year over year after its highest earnings segment, the iPhone, saw revenue tumble 2% alongside dips in Mac, iPad, and wearable sales.\nHowever, there's reason to believe the current challenges are only temporary, meaning it's still worth investing in Apple. The company has built immense brand loyalty with its users, which resulted in the third largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S. despite offering a significantly fewer products compared to industry leaders Amazon and Walmart.\nThe popularity of Apple's products bodes well for its soon-to-be-launched Vision Pro, its first VR/AR headset, which will hit the shelves in 2024. Data from Fortune Business Insights shows the VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030.\nMeanwhile, Apple has a reputation for entering new markets and quickly rising to dominance, attracting consumers with its focus on quality, connectivity between its devices, and easy-to-use design language.\nApple hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Alongside a highly lucrative digital services business, the company remains an attractive growth stock for the new year.\nAmazon and Apple dominate their respective industries and are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon. They have long histories of delivering consistent and significant gains, making them some of the best growth stocks out there. However, just because a company is leading an industry, that doesn't necessarily mean it's trading at the right price.\nThis chart compares both companies' price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, with Amazon's lower figure suggesting its shares are currently the better value. P/S is calculated by dividing a company's total market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. As a result, Amazon's solid performance and financial growth have made it the better growth stock and set it up to be an excellent investment for 2024.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Amazon made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 18, 2023\n\u00a0\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Text": "Tech giant Apple Inc. has entered the virtual reality (VR) competition with the recent announcement of its new product Vision Pro. Set to be available for preorders in February, the unveiling of this cutting-edge device marks a significant milestone for Apple.\nApple experienced a remarkable 45% stock price rise last year, but shares are about flat to start 2024, fortunate to even bounce back after two prominent analyst downgrades. Coming off a 2.8% year-over-year decline in revenue in 2023, Apple will need to sell and execute its future.\nDon't Miss:\nHere is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\nManagement is betting big on VR to get it there. Apple CEO Tim Cook has long been known as an operational genius, not a product genius, which makes this technological innovation potentially legacy-defining.\nWith this new hot product, the spotlight is now on Apple, and the question looms whether Vision Pro can give a boost to its sales to justify its roughly 30 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nThe Vision Pro, priced at $3,499, is positioning itself as a high-end competitor in the market. This places it at seven times the cost of Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset priced at $500.\nThe significant price difference raises questions about the features and capabilities that justify Vision Pro\u2019s premium positioning compared to Meta\u2019s offering. Price was called out by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg, who reportedly said Apple's vision is \"not the one [he] wants.\"\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), a key and established player in the VR space, introduced its first virtual-reality headset, the Oculus Quest, in 2019. Its latest release, the Quest 3, hit the market in October, further intensifying competition in the VR sector.\nTrending: How to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024? These investors have the latest tips.\nMETA saw significant success in 2023, with a remarkable 128% increase in share price. It continues to hold strong in the early days of 2024.\nBut several industry giants have competing views on what the metaverse is and should be. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., which owns the rights to the popular book and movie \"Ready Player One,\" recently announced a new VR venture. Ready Player One is set in a dystopian future where humanity has largely lost hope in the real world. As such, people have retreated to the OASIS, a metaverse so integral the virtual currency is more valuable than the real deal.\nDespite the book outlining a bleak and dystopian future, Warner Bros. has begun development of a Ready Player One-based metaverse. Oddly, this venture is at the approval and direction of the author of the \"Ready Player One\" series Ernest Cline.\nThe move comes as companies continue to integrate virtual and augmented reality features into their existing business plans. Amazon.com Inc. recently launched augmented reality shopping, The Walt Disney Co. launched a virtual reality division, and Meta continues to pioneer within the space.\nMetaverse startups saw roughly $500 million raised from venture capital in 2023. While this is a far cry from larger funding areas like AI, it still represents a shift in investments. As larger players continue to make investments and build products in the space, it will likely play a larger role in everyday life.

But it later closed at $402.56, valuing Microsoft at $2.99 trillion, just below the threshold price of $403.65 that would have kept it above $3 trillion.\nApple's shares pared earlier gains and closed down 0.35% at $194.50, giving it a market value of $3 trillion, according to LSEG data.\nBacked by its investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is widely seen as a frontrunner in the race for market dominance in the rollout of generative artificial intelligence (AI) among other tech heavyweights, including Google owner Alphabet, Amazon.com, Oracle, and Facebook owner Meta Platforms.\nUsing OpenAI's technology, Microsoft has rolled out newer versions of its flagship productivity software products as well as its Bing search engine, which is expected to better compete with Google's dominant search offering.\nApple, on the other hand, is facing slowing demand for its iPhones, particularly in China, where the company is offering customers rare discounts to boost sales amid stiff competition from homegrown rivals such as Huawei Technologies.\n\"I think it's AI optimism for Microsoft,\" said Stifel analyst Brad Reback, adding that Apple doesn't seem to have the same \"clear AI story\" coupled with concerns about iPhone sales growth rates and penetration.\nThe 54 analysts covering Microsoft's stock have a median price target of $425, up from $415 a month ago, and their average recommendation is \"buy\", according to LSEG data.\nBuoyed by AI optimism, Microsoft shares gained nearly 57% in 2023 and are up 7% this year. Apple's stock rose by 48% last year and is up about 1% year-to-date.\nWall Street's run-up to record highs will be put to the test in the coming weeks as megacap U.S. technology-related companies begin reporting results.\n(This story has been refiled to adjust year-to-date gains for Microsoft and Apple in paragraph 10)\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Additional reporting by by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; Editing by Mark Porter, Bill Berkrot, David Evans and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

Big time.\nWhich is why Fortune\u2019s annual World\u2019s Most Admired Companies list deserves some attention.\u00a0The\u00a0more than\u00a03,700 executives, directors, and analysts polled in this effort by our partners at Korn Ferry don\u2019t, for the most part, have any special window into what\u2019s going on at these companies.\u00a0But they do have a good sense of how they are viewed by the people who matter. \nSo what can we learn from this year\u2019s list? Well first of all, when it comes to reputation, tech rules.\u00a0Apple is No. 1, Microsoft No. 2, and Amazon No. 3.\u00a0But that\u2019s why I think special credit should be given to legacy companies who continue to rank well.\u00a0Take Walmart, a company that many once thought would be defeated by the ascent of Amazon.\u00a0Instead, its\u00a0reputation continues to rise, hitting the No. 9 spot this year, up from 13 last year.

Well, kudos to Eli Lilly, which jumped onto the all-star list at No. 34 this year, and ended Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 10-year reign as the most admired pharmaceutical company.\u00a0And regrets to Disney, which fell to No. 12 from No. 6, and ceded its spot as the most admired entertainment company to Netflix.\u00a0(Note that the methodology for choosing\u00a0the top-ranked companies within industries\u00a0is different than that for choosing all-stars, which is why Netflix still ranks below Disney on the all-star list at No. 23.)\nCredit also goes to Moderna (No. 37), Mastercard (No. 40), L\u2019Oreal (No. 43), and\u00a0Adobe (No. 46),\u00a0which made the top 50 after not being ranked last year.\u00a0And bye-bye to last year\u2019s winners McDonald\u2019s, Nestle, Unilever, Lockheed Martin, and Charles Schwab, which dropped off the list.\nYou can explore the full list here.

        "Text": "Good morning.\nA longtime Apple finance executive is headed to Sonos to become CFO.\nSaori Casey will join the company as its new finance chief effective Jan. 22. Casey succeeds Eddie Lazarus, who will become chief strategy officer and remain chief legal officer.\nCasey joins Sonos after serving almost 13 years as VP of finance at Apple. Before that, she spent 15 years at Cisco, holding several finance leadership roles in operations, sales, R&D, FP&A, M&A, and systems.\u00a0She told me that her main focus for the first 90 days in her new role will be meeting people and learning the business, including \"what\u2019s working and what's not before establishing my priorities\" en route to building out the company globally.\nSonos, which trades as SONO on the Nasdaq, is a developer and manufacturer of wireless, portable speakers and home sound systems. \u201cThe depth and breadth\u201d of Casey\u2019s experience at \u201cworld-class companies\u201d makes her well suited to build the company\u2019s momentum, CEO Patrick Spence said in a statement announcing her hire on Tuesday.\nAlong with all financial functions, Casey will help oversee technology. \"The speed of change in the technology field is very exciting,\" she told me. \"It affords you the opportunity to continue to learn and grow in your career, and it's so rewarding to know you\u2019re contributing to something bigger than yourself.\"\nComing into a CFO role for the first time, is there a particular part of her experience that's prepared her for this next step?\n\"I\u2019ve navigated my career rounding out various finance experiences,\" Casey told me. \"Most recently, I helped manage Apple\u2019s total company P&L\u2014working closely with the CEO and the CFO and contributed to scaling the company from approximately $65 billion to nearly $400 billion in revenue.\"\nBut she also has experience with investor relations and engaging with board members \"having worked in the trenches very close to the business with R&D, sales, and operations,\" which, she added, \"will also serve me well.\"\nCasey said that her career goals and aspirations were never about chasing titles. \"I always focused on working for the best companies and assuming roles where I\u2019d be best positioned to make the most impact while continuing to learn,\" she said.\nFacing headwinds, Sonos' overall revenue for the full fiscal year of 2023 came in at $1.655 billion, a decline of\u00a05.5% (about $97.1 million) compared with sales of $1.752 billion in fiscal 2022.\u00a0But the company maintained innovation with new product releases. \"As we enter fiscal 2024, we are laser-focused on execution and positioning our business to return to top and bottom line growth when conditions improve,\u201d Spence stated in the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings release. But he also hinted at a major product launch, citing an \"entry into a new multibillion-dollar category in the second half of the year that will complement our current offering, delight customers, and drive immediate revenue.\"\nThat category may be the company\u2019s entry into the headphones arena, competing with Apple and Bose, according to reports. Casey declined to comment further on the matter, but did say she is \"excited about our product roadmap and the year ahead.\" Sonos is making strategic hires as Casey's appointment follows the hires of Dunja LaRosa, who joined as chief revenue officer, and Deirdre Findlay, who joined as chief commercial officer in October.\nReflecting on her new role, Casey also shared with me some of the best career advice she's ever received: \"Believe in your instincts, speak up\u2014but stay authentic to your style.\"\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Chief Executive Officer Joe Kiani, waging a legal fight with Apple Inc. over a blood oxygen feature, said that consumers are better off without the iPhone maker\u2019s version of the technology.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nApple Dials Back Car\u2019s Self-Driving Features and Delays Launch to 2028\nChina Weighs Stock Market Rescue Package Backed by $278 Billion\nTurkey Approves Sweden NATO Bid, Leaving Hungary as Holdout\nAn Isolated Israel Doubles Down on War in Gaza \u2014 At All Costs\nNetflix Pays $5 Billion for \u2018Raw\u2019 in Bet on Live Events\nThe remarks followed Apple\u2019s decision to cease sales of smartwatches Thursday that had the tool \u2014 a gauge of blood oxygen saturation known as a pulse oximeter \u2014 which had been a heavily marketed health feature on the devices. The move stemmed from a ruling by the US International Trade Commission that found the technology violated Masimo patents.\nCustomers should buy pulse oximeters from Masimo or others instead, Kiani said in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg TV. \u201cApple is masquerading what they are offering to consumers as a reliable, medical pulse oximeter, even though it is not,\u201d he said. \u201cI really feel wholeheartedly that consumers are better off without it.\u201d\nRead more: Why Apple Had to Disable Oxygen Sensor in Its Watches: QuickTake\nApple said that Kiani\u2019s claims are false and that its watch\u2019s blood oxygen feature is accurate, works very well for customers and in some cases can save lives. After a US federal appeals court denied Apple a reprieve, the company began selling tweaked versions of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches Thursday without the feature. Apple said it strongly disagrees with the court\u2019s decision and is appealing the ITC ban.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s implementation of blood oxygen sensing, Masimo\u2019s offering has been approved by the US Federal Drug Administration, Kiani said. He criticized the Apple feature for just taking two measurements a day and claimed the company only released the tool during the Covid pandemic to take market share from Fitbit, now part of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\n\u201cPulse oximetry is not useful unless it is a continuous monitor,\u201d Kiani said. \u201cThat happens during sleep. During sleep, you could have a desaturation that might be related to apnea. You can have a dangerous desaturation to opioid pain relief you might have taken. That is where the value comes.\u201d\nIn response, Apple said that its watch wasn\u2019t designed to detect desaturation events and that it\u2019s not a continuous blood oxygen monitor. Instead, the device does on-demand spot checks and intermittent background checks for blood oxygen levels. It added that the continuous measurements Kiani describes don\u2019t make a device accurate. Accuracy is determined by comparisons to high-quality reference data, the company said.\nRead More: Masimo CEO Open to Settling Apple Rift But \u2018They Haven\u2019t Called\u2019\nMasimo\u2019s CEO said he hasn\u2019t spoken to Apple personally about a settlement, and that nobody from Apple has reached out about coming to an agreement.\n\u201cThere are court-ordered mediations that I cannot get into that have been held before,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there will be additional meetings probably in the future.\u201d\nKiani added that he doesn\u2019t consider those meetings to be steps toward settling litigation. Apple disputed Kiani\u2019s characterization that nobody from Apple has reached out, saying that the company has held a mediation and that a future meeting has been set.\nThe executive also criticized the idea that his company is throwing everything it can at Apple to see what sticks, saying that none of his company\u2019s patents have been invalidated.\nApple is living in a \u201cfake reality,\u201d Kiani said. \u201cThis narrative is false.\u201d\nFor its part, Apple said 15 of 17 Masimo patents have been found invalid in earlier litigation. The ITC case centers on two patents.\n(Updated with responses from Apple starting in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHong Kong\u2019s High Rents Create a New Type of Cross-Border Commuter\nIt\u2019s the Tesla Earnings Call\u2014Time for Elon Musk Bingo\nHow Sweden Quit Smoking Without Quitting Nicotine\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.\nShould I Tell My Colleagues (or My Boss) About My Bipolar Diagnosis?\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Tesla could become the world\u2019s most valuable company, surpassing Apple and Aramco combined, as long as it \u201cexecutes well\u201d over the next five years.\nThis is a prediction that its chief executive Elon Musk first made on Tesla\u2019s third-quarter earnings call but confirmed at the end of the year.\n\u201cI stand by my prediction that, if Tesla executes extremely well over the next 5 years, that the long term value could exceed Apple and Aramco combined,\u201d Musk wrote in an X post.\nApple\u2019s market capitalization is $2.99 trillion at the moment, with Aramco\u2019s at $2.13 trillion. Tesla\u2019s current market cap, on the other hand, is $778.6 billion. The stock has grown significantly over the past year, however.\nAt the start of January 2023, Tesla traded at some $108 per share. It ended the year at close to $250 per share.\nThis is not to say that the year has been without challenges. Like all EV makers, Tesla has suffered a decline in sales, which prompted the company to cut prices. The environment seems th be especially challenging in China, which is a key market for the carmaker and also an intensely competitive one.\nEven so, Tesla is expected to report record sales for the last quarter of the year, although they will likely fall short of Musk\u2019s own plans for 2023 sales. Per an LSEG poll reported by Reuters, Tesla\u2019s 2023 sales will likely stand at 1.82 million cars.\nThis would be a 37% increase on the year. Of this total, 473,000 cars are seen getting sold in the final quarter of the year. Per plans, Tesla should have hit sales of 2 million cars in 2023, Reuters noted in its report.\nThis year is going to be even more challenging as the end of tax credit enters into effect and EV hesitancy persists, with doubts emerging about the quality of Tesla vehicles contributing to a troubling market environment.\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\nTwo Elections that Will Impact Energy and Geopolitics in 2024\nEcuador\u2019s NOC Declares Force Majeure After Indigenous Protests\nIran Deploys Warship to Red Sea Amid Rising Tensions\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n"

        "Text": "Apple Inc. has delisted several major offshore cryptocurrency exchange applications, including Binance and KuCoin, from its App Store in India, following a government crackdown on exchanges that have not complied with the country\u2019s anti-money laundering regulations.\nLast December, India\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) issued show cause notices to nine cryptocurrency exchanges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), prompting Apple\u2019s latest action.\nThe FIU, operating under the Ministry of Finance, has mandated that cryptocurrency exchanges register as \u201cReporting Entities\u201d to ensure adherence to the PMLA\u2019s record-keeping and reporting requirements. Many offshore exchanges serving the Indian market have failed to comply, effectively operating outside the established anti-money laundering framework.\nLocal users have been advised to transfer their assets to compliant, FIU-registered Indian exchanges to maintain control and mitigate risks associated with non-compliant platforms.\nThe Indian government has historically taken a firm stance on cryptocurrencies. Last year, it imposed a 30% flat tax on all crypto income and later added a 1% tax deducted at source, or TDS, on crypto trades above 10,000 Indian rupees (US$120). Local exchanges, such as CoinDCX, have reportedly blamed the 1% levy for crushing the local industry\u2019s trading volumes, driving many traders to seek out global platforms with less stringent know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the nation\u2019s central bank, previously attempted to ban cryptocurrencies \u2014 a decision that was later overturned by the Supreme Court. The RBI continues to express concerns, likening cryptocurrencies to Ponzi schemes.\nThe decision by Apple, the largest company in the world by market capitalization, to support the government\u2019s efforts by removing these apps from its store, may further damage the accessibility of cryptocurrency trading services in India.\nDespite Apple\u2019s move, the affected applications remain available on the Google Play Store, and their websites are still accessible within India, BeInCrypto reported. Binance South Asia has publicly stated its intention to engage with regulators to address the situation, reassuring existing app users that they will not be impacted and emphasizing the company\u2019s dedication to regulatory compliance.\n"

        "Text": "US stocks' recent slump continued on Thursday, as equities struggled to shake off a dismal start to the year and Federal Reserve policymakers left hopes for an early interest rate cut hanging.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed just above the flatline, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.3%. After a Wednesday sell-off, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pushed for gains at points in the session, but fell nearly 0.6% below the flatline by the close.\nInvestors looking for confirmation of bets on a March rate cut got uncertainty instead in the Fed minutes released Wednesday. While officials agreed rates had reached a peak and should be lower by the end of 2024, some signaled that they could stay at their historically high levels \"for some time\" depending on the path of inflation.\nIn single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) stock stumbled for a fourth straight day as Wall Street highlighted concerns about weakening iPhone demand.\nRead more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nMultiple data points released Thursday morning showed the labor market remains intact while wages continue to cool, a welcome sign in the fight against inflation.\nThe latest ADP employment report showed private companies added 164,000 jobs in the month of December, above November's reading of 103,000 and higher than analysts' expectations for 115,000 additions.\nElsewhere, the Department of Labor reported that 202,000 jobless claims were filed last week, below economist estimates for 216,000.\nMeanwhile, US bond yields returned to gains, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) edging closer to 4% after falling away from that level on Wednesday.\nInvestors will now turn to the December jobs report. The monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 175,000 in December while the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.8% from the previous month, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe stock market's slide to kick off 2024 continued on Thursday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed just above the flatline, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.3%. After a Wednesday sell-off, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pushed for gains at points in the session, but fell nearly 0.6% below the flatline by the close.\nMeanwhile, tech stalwart Apple (AAPL) stock stumbled for a fourth-straight day as Wall Street's highlighted concerns about weakening iPhone demand. The big tech giant is now down almost 6% in the last five days.\nQuantumScape Corporation (QS) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Thursday. Shares of the Volkswagen's battery subsidiary soared almost 50% after its solid-state cell passed its first endurance test. \nMobileye Global (MBLY) stock dropped roughly 25% after the chipmaker announced it expects first quarter revenue to be down abut 50%. The stock had rallied nearly 30% over the last two months prior to the release.\nWalgreens (WBA) stock fell about 6% after reporting quarterly results. The company announced its cutting its dividend by 48% to $0.25 a share from $0.48 a share.\nPeloton (PTON) stock soared more than 15% on Thursday after an announcement that it will be launching a partnership with TikTok that will feature short-form fitness videos and other content.\nTravel stocks were trading higher on Thursday as oil prices fell, signaling lower fuel costs for cruise line and airline operators.\nAmerican Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL), and United (UAL) all rose more than 1%. Cruise line operators Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Carnival (CCL) surged more than 2%.\nOil futures fell more than 2% earlier in the session amid higher-than-expected builds of US gasoline and distillate fuels.\nMeanwhile, energy-related stocks were under pressure on Thursday. The S&P 500 Energy Select ETF (XLE) was the worst-performing sector, down more than 1%.\nThe December jobs report is set for release Friday morning and is expected to show further signs of a cooling labor market to finish 2023.\nThe monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 175,000 in December while the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.8% from the previous month, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. In November, the US economy added 199,000 jobs while unemployment unexpectedly fell to 3.7%.\nHere are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at, according to data from Bloomberg:\nOnce again, the report will be a crucial test for the stock market's end-of-year rally. Investors have largely attributed the move that pushed stocks near all-time highs to a shift in sentiment as many now believe the Federal Reserve can achieve a so-called soft landing, where inflation retreats to 2% without a complete downturn in economic growth.\n\"We expect the December employment report to show slower job growth and a further moderation in nominal wage growth, both something the Federal Reserve wants to see as it attempts to engineer a soft-landing,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in note on Thursday.\nOil prices reversed course on Thursday after weekly US gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles pointed to lower demand.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% before paring most of those losses following the release of US crude inventory data. Brent (BZ=F) also sank into negative territory, losing its earlier gains.\nGasoline stockpiles rose by 10.9 million barrels, their highest week-over-week increase in more than three decades, according to Energy Information Administration data.\nCrude inventories fell by 5.5 million barrels for the week ending Dec. 29, but the bigger-than-expected draw may reflect supplies from the US making up for shipment interruptions stemming from Red Sea tensions.\nOil futures were up more than 1% earlier in the session, extending their gains from Wednesday amid concerns of supply interruptions in Libya.\nA precipitous fall in mortgage rates has stalled to start 2024.\nYahoo Finance's Rebeca Chen reports:\nThe average rates for 30-year loans inched up to 6.62% from 6.61% a week ago, according to tracking by Freddie Mac on Thursday. Aside from this week's minuscule rise, rates have been declining for weeks since late October, falling nearly 117 basis points from a 12-month high of 7.79% at the end of October.\nThose recent declines have boosted homebuyers' ability to purchase homes, but further affordability improvement could be curbed by a continual supply shortage, especially if lower rates bring back sidelined demand.\n\"While mortgage interest rates are expected to overall decline in 2024, minor fluctuations in weekly mortgage interest rates are to be expected,\" Jessica Lautz,the National Association of Realtors\u2019 deputy chief economist, wrote to Yahoo Finance.\n\"The biggest demand is likely to come from those who had been priced out of the homebuying market. For spring, there will likely be competition among the steady share of all-cash homebuyers and first-time buyers trying to edge in,\" Lautz added.\nStocks are off to a rough start in 2024.\nThe famed Santa Claus Rally didn't come. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) had its fourth-worst first day of a new year ever. And the Russell 2000 (^RUT), a darling of the recent market rally, just had its third-worst two-day start to a year ever.\n\"It's fair to say that financial markets have started 2024 with something of a mild hangover,\" Capital Economics deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann wrote in a research note Wednesday.\nBut some on Wall Street think the current drivers of the market have been macro-focused. When that sentiment shifts to focus on earnings, the rally can continue.\nRecent data from FactSet shows analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report earnings growth of 11.7% for the full year, which would be above the 10-year average annual earnings growth rate of 8.4%.\nThat earnings backdrop is one of the main drivers behind Bank of America seeing nearly 10% growth for the S&P 500 from current levels, per BofA equity strategist Ohsung Kwon.\n\"Earnings season, starting next week, is going to be key to the market,\" Kwon said.\nWith companies officially exiting the earnings recession in the third quarter, Kwon believes that momentum continuing is crucial to the bullish thesis.\n\"Companies have cut costs throughout the earnings recession,\" Kwon said. \"They have managed margins. Margins went up for the second straight quarter. So I think the momentum is to the upside and if companies talk more positively this earnings season, given that the rate pressure and the macro uncertainty has eased somewhat. Now, that's going to be bullish for equities.\"\nUS stocks stalled on Thursday, struggling to shake off a dismal start to the year after Federal Reserve policymakers left hopes for an early interest-rate cut hanging.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.1%. Tech stocks signaled a return to their Wednesday sell-off, as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped about 0.4%.\nMultiple data points released Thursday morning showed the labor market remains intact while wages continue to cool, a welcome sign in the fight against inflation.\nThe latest ADP employment report showed private companies added 164,000 jobs in the month of December, above November's reading of 103,000 and higher than analyst expectations for 115,000 additions.\nAlso within the release, ADP revealed annual wage growth fell to 5.4% from 5.6% the month prior.\n\"We're returning to a labor market that's very much aligned with pre-pandemic hiring,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \"While wages didn't drive the recent bout of inflation, now that pay growth has retreated, any risk of a wage-price spiral has all but disappeared.\"\nElsewhere, data from the Department of Labor shows 202,000 jobless claims were filed last week, below economist estimates for 216,000. Jobless claims are an area several economists have told Yahoo Finance they're monitoring for signs of a slowdown, as an uptick in claims would mean more people are being laid off from their jobs.\nThe big labor data update for the week still awaits investors as the December jobs report is expected for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.\nApple (AAPL) was hit with its second downgrade in the four days of 2024, this time from Piper Sandler.\nThe reason for the downgrade from analyst Harsh Kumar was similar to the one from peers at Barclays earlier this week: iPhone demand, especially in an expectedly weak Chinese market.\nApple's stock has already been hit this year, and it was down more than 1% in premarket trading on Thursday:\nPiper Sandler's downgrade to Neutral from Overweight was perhaps less jarring than that of Barclays, which cut its rating to Underweight on Tuesday. Apple's stock responded with its biggest percentage drop since September.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the percentage of analysts with a bullish rating on the stock is at a three-year low.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "In a recent incident, an iPhone user managed to recover their stolen device from an EcoATM kiosk at Walmart Inc., thanks to Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"Find My\" app\u2019s location tracking feature.\nWhat Happened: A user posted on Reddit that their iPhone 15 was stolen at their workplace. The thief turned off the device, making it untraceable. Assuming the phone was lost for good, the user settled their old phone\u2019s dues and bought a new one.\nThe next day, the \u201cFind My\u201d app started displaying the phone\u2019s changing locations. Eventually, the device\u2019s location was traced to a nearby Walmart. The user and a friend went to the store and began looking for the phone.\nSee Also: Lost Your iPhone And Receiving Weird Texts To Unlock It?

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- India stepped up its crackdown on offshore crypto exchanges operating without local registrations, asking Apple Inc. to take the apps of platforms including Binance off its App Store in the country.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Scores Easy Win in Iowa With DeSantis a Distant Second\nUS Merchant Vessel Struck as Shippers Told to Avoid Red Sea\nIowa Latest: Biden Calls Trump \u2018Clear Frontrunner\u2019 After Win\nWhat Is Disease X?

They were removed on directions from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the request isn\u2019t public.\nThe move marks a significant escalation of India\u2019s clampdown on offshore crypto platforms like Binance, which started Dec. 28 when authorities notified nine exchanges that they are suspected of misconduct. Indian crypto traders had already began moving deposits to local exchanges that abide by the nation\u2019s regulations, fearful of losing access to their funds.\nAuthorities also asked Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google to remove the apps, one of the people said. Google Play Store in India still featured the exchange apps that were taken off the App Store as of 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday. Apple, Google and India\u2019s technology ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\nIndia\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit issued so-called compliance show-cause notice to the nine offshore platforms on Dec. 28 and also asked the information ministry to block the URLs of the entities. The FIU at the time said the exchanges are operating illegally in India without complying with anti-money laundering laws. The websites are still accessible from India.\nOf the exchanges singled out in that announcement, only Bitstamp was still available to download on the local App Store on Wednesday. Of the two versions US-based Kraken offers, only the Pro version was available.\nBinance, the biggest crypto exchange, has come under intense pressure from regulators around the world who accuse it of catering to local users without a license. India joins countries including Belgium and Australia in moving to block the company, which says it doesn\u2019t have a global headquarters and in November agreed to pay $4.3 billion as it pleaded guilty in the US to anti-money laundering and sanction violations.\n\u201cThe ongoing situation is not unique to Binance and impacts certain other web3 industry apps as well,\u201d a Binance spokesperson said by email. \u201cWe are working hard to inform constructive policy-making that seeks to benefit every user and all market participants.\u201d\nHTX, formerly known as Huobi, said it has no operations in India. Bitfinex, KuCoin, Bitstamp and Kraken didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nIndia\u2019s government last year imposed money-laundering provisions on the crypto sector as it tightens oversight of digital assets along with other countries. In 2022, authorities delivered a major blow to local crypto exchanges by introducing a tax on transactions that caused trading volumes to instantly plummet.\nLocal exchanges had complained that the 1% levy, known as Tax Deducted at Source, drove Indian crypto traders to offshore platforms that didn\u2019t impose it, further hurting their revenues. CoinDCX Chief Executive Officer Sumit Gupta in October estimated that 95% of trading volume had moved to offshore venues.\n(Updates with comment from Binance in paragraph 8.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nChinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\nHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg\u2019s Top Priority\nTrumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nFive ETFs to Watch in 2024\nKim Kardashian\u2019s Skims Isn\u2019t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Apple supplier Goertek said on Monday it would invest up to US$280 million to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in Vietnam to meet demands for \"business expansion and long-term operation\" in the Southeast Asian nation, according to a corporate filing.\nGoertek's Vietnamese entity, which will manufacture consumer electronics products from AirPods and smartwatches to virtual reality and augmented reality gear, is a project that will meet both the Chinese assembler's future development plan and client demand, it said in the filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\n\"[The project] is advantageous to make better use of local resources in Vietnam to enhance the company's overall competitiveness,\" Goertek said.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nGoertek has been tapped by Apple to become one of the major mainland suppliers of its mixed reality Vision Pro headset, which is set to launch in early February.\nThe Vietnamese subsidiary, which will be set up through its Hong Kong entity Goertek (Hong Kong) Co, is expected to be located in the Bac Ninh province, which has attracted investment from a raft of South Korean firms including consumer electronics and semiconductor giant Samsung Electronics.\nSouth Korean firms have emerged as major investors in the Vietnamese province, setting up factories for electronics, smartphone, semiconductor and precision mechanical manufacturing, according to the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nGoertek's latest move comes as Apple is starting to shift more of its production outside China, a move that came after Beijing's stringent Covid-19 restrictions during the pandemic disrupted Apple's supply chain, impacting its global sales in the lead up to the Christmas shopping season in 2022.\nSince then, Apple has encouraged its manufacturing partners to diversify into other countries, including Vietnam, to reduce its reliance on China.\nApple suppliers, including Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, have invested up to US$16 billion to reduce their dependence on China, by relocating facilities to India, Vietnam, Mexico as well as the US, according to a report by AppleInsider, citing research by investment bank TD Cowen.\nLate last year, Foxconn, the biggest maker of iPhones, announced a plan to invest US$1.6 billion in India to expand its presence in the South Asian nation.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund has pumped more than half a billion dollars into a virtual reality headset to rival Apple\u2019s Vision Pro goggles.\nIts Public Investment Fund has injected $590m (\u00a3463m) into Magic Leap, a US company developing head gear designed to superimpose virtual images over the real world.\nApple is to launch its long-awaited $3,499 Vision Pro headset on Friday, pitting it against Magic Leap and Facebook-owner Meta in the race to develop virtual and augmented reality gadgets.\nMagic Leap launched an advanced pair of augmented reality glasses in 2015 but enjoyed little commercial success. The new debt funding brings the total raised by Florida-based Magic Leap, which has never turned a profit, to more than $4.5bn.\nFilings for Magic Leap\u2019s European division showed that, as of November, the group had issued \u201ca further $590m of convertible debt to the Ultimate Parent Undertaking [the Public Investment Fund] in exchange for cash\u201d in 2023.\nSaudi Arabia became the majority owner of Magic Leap two years ago, The Telegraph previously disclosed, after the technology company was forced to turn to investors for more cash.\nLaunched by entrepreneur Rony Abovitz in 2010, Magic Leap previously raised funding from investors including Google and the US telecoms company AT&T.\nMr Abovitz stepped down in 2020. His successor, Peggy Johnson, was replaced by former Bain Capital executive Ross Rosenburg in October.\nWhile originally targeting its $3,299 headset at consumers, Magic Leap has since pushed its gadget towards corporate customers. It has also looked to license its intellectual property to other tech giants.\nThe Financial Times reported it had held talks with Meta last year about using its designs.\nTim Cook, the head of Apple, has said of its headset: \u201cVision Pro is years ahead and unlike anything created before.\u201d\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
