        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:\n\u201cI think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.\u201d\nThe analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.\n\u201cMy probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it\u2019s not dominant. Why isn\u2019t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan\u2014at the end of July, the Fed didn\u2019t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it\u2019s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nThe demand for Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s\u00a0iPhone 16 Pro models has largely met expectations so far. In contrast, interest in the base model and 16 Plus has not matched last year\u2019s figures, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from TF International Securities.\nIn a recent post on X, Kuo indicated that assembly orders have remained mostly steady. Suppliers were instructed to keep producing the two Pro models during China\u2019s National Day holiday, signaling that demand for these models is consistent with forecasts. He noted a minor reduction in component orders for the 16 base model and 16 Plus for mid-November onward, with cuts amounting to less than 3% to 5%, which Kuo considers negligible.\nShipments for the iPhone 16 Pro are on par with those of last year\u2019s 15 Pro, but current shipping times for the 16 Pro are shorter. While the base model and 16 Plus are experiencing weaker demand compared to last year, Kuo highlighted that the focus will soon shift to the possible effects on demand and shipments in the U.S. market once the AI tool, Apple Intelligence, is rolled out later in October.\nKuo reiterated his production forecast for the iPhone 16 at 88 million to 89 million units for Q4 2024, a slight decrease from the previous year\u2019s estimate of 90 million to 91 million units.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features. But the latest numbers for iPhone 16 do not show much enthusiasm for the new device.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cYou probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire\u2019s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett\u2019s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire\u2019s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Jabin Bastian ",
        "Text": "Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 3.6% in the morning session after Barclays analyst Tim Long highlighted data that tracks global iPhone availability and wait times, suggesting weak demand for the new iPhone 16. The analyst has an Underweight (Sell) rating and a price target of $186.Separately, the major indices declined (Nasdaq down 1.8%, S&P 500 down 0.9%) amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. NBC News reported (citing White House and Defense Department officials) that the U.S. \"has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.\" Lastly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told investors there is no \"preset course\" regarding the pace of future rate cuts. He added in a speech delivered to the National Association for Business Economics, \"Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course.\" While the markets could still be right about more rate cuts in the near term, Powell's comments added uncertainty to both the cadence and magnitude of cuts. Following these updates, the VIX index (or fear gauge) spiked as the reports created more uncertainty, which investors certainly don't like.\n\u00a0\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nApple\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 2 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nApple is up 21.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $224.76 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $234.82 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,003.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\nThe labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy.\nCohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.\nCohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive.\nAs the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss his expectations of the market.\nExpectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.\nThis year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions.\nNow that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nAnalyst Upside as of October 13, 2024: 10%\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the popular company behind the iPhone, ranks third on our list of the most promising stocks according to hedge funds. The company offers a range of products including iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nThe company is leveraging artificial intelligence to offer unmatched experiences to its customers. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence by Apple backed by AI. The system is integrated into the new iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\nSpeaking of its biggest avenue for revenue, the iPhone generated revenue worth $39.3 billion during FQ3 2024, making up for nearly 45% of the total revenue. Over the past 10 years, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has grown its revenue and net income by 8% and 10% respectively.\nLast month, the company launched its new iPhone 16, iOS 18 system, AirPods 4, and Apple Watch Series 10 around the world. While Apple has its bets on the new iPhone, one can say that its integrated artificial intelligence systems will play a role in boosting financial performance for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "Long-time cash-generating king Apple AAPL has been a staple in portfolios over the years, providing investors with outsized gains. And recently, the Mag 7 member hit fresh all-time highs, reflecting considerably bullish price action.\nStocks making new highs tend to make even higher highs, particularly when a company\u2019s outlook remains positive.\nShould investors tap into the momentum? Let\u2019s take a closer look at how the tech titan stacks up.\n\u00a0\nFirstly, investors should be aware the company is expected to report its next set of quarterly results on October 31st after the market\u2019s close.\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nExpectations for the above-mentioned release are overall flat from the end of July, but the recent downward revisions that hit the tape near the beginning of October are certainly more notable given their recency.\nModest growth is forecasted, with the current $1.54 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting a 5% climb year-over-year. Top line revisions have been slightly more positive, with forecasted sales of $94.5 billion 5.6% higher than the year-ago figure.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nA key item to keep an eye on during the upcoming release is the company\u2019s Services results, which have provided a nice growth tailwind over recent years and have consistently exceeded consensus expectations in recent periods.\nFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services revenue stands at $25.8 billion, 15% higher than the year-ago mark and reflecting an all-time record. Investors should also expect commentary surrounding the iPhone 16 and its AI efforts as well.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe valuation picture here is a bit rich, likely reflective of investors\u2019 consistent growth expectations. The current forward 12-month earnings multiple works out to 30.5X, well above the 26.3X five-year median but beneath five-year highs of 36.1X.\nAnd the current PEG works out to 2.4X, again above the 2.2X five-year median. The stock sports a Style Score of \u2018D\u2019 for Value. While the valuation is undoubtedly a bit steep, the company\u2019s consistent earnings growth over the years helps provide a more positive outlook.\nThe current forward 12-month earnings multiple reflects a 38% premium relative to the S&P 500.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnd its strong cash-generating abilities have provided the flexibility to reward its shareholders nicely, currently sporting a 5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares reflect a nice opportunity for income-focused investors seeking technology exposure.\n\u00a0\nApple AAPL recently saw its shares touch all-time highs, reflecting bullish momentum. Given its rock-solid fundamentals paired with consistent earnings power, the stock continues to deserve a spot in any investor\u2019s portfolio.\nThe valuation picture is a bit elevated here, though it\u2019s worth noting that the stock has historically traded at higher multiples given consistently high expectations that have largely been met. \nAnd while the company isn\u2019t posting the breakneck growth that it once enjoyed, Services results paired with optimism surrounding the new iPhone 16 model and AI capabilities should provide bullish tailwinds.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds.\nInvestors had been anxiously anticipating the start of a bull market, which the S&P 500 confirmed earlier this year. The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy\u00a0and\u00a07 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\nIt\u2019s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn\u2019t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\u201cNow is the time to just be cautious. Don\u2019t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won\u2019t work,\u201d the portfolio manager told CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Exchange.\n\u201cWhile our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don\u2019t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,\u201d Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock\u2019s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you\u2019ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\ndavid-dvoracek-19-rJG0QENU-unsplash\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, as it reduces its reliance on the hardware business. While the company is best known for its iPhone product line, it\u2019s also a key player in cloud computing, offering various services, including game subscriptions and app sales.\nThe iPhone product line accounted for 52% of Apple\u2019s $296.1 billion revenues for the three quarters that ended in June. Likewise, Apple has moved to reduce its reliance on the iPhone product line by focusing on the service front, which is expected to be a key driver of long-term value.\nConsequently, the company has been growing its prospects in advertising, supporting products, cloud service, app store sales, and payments. During the most recent three-month period, services sales increased by 14.1% to $24.2 billion.\nMoreover, the service sector boasts of a significantly greater gross margin than hardware, at 74% compared to 35.3% for hardware sales. They also provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is exactly what shareholders want.\nEven as Apple faces slow hardware sales, it is increasingly investing in artificial intelligence as it seeks to enhance user experience with its devices. New devices are coming with AI-powered software to help summarize text, boost writing skills, and edit photos as Apple seeks to fuel sales.\nThere is no doubt that Apple trades at a premium as a growth stock with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34.7 compared to an average P/E of 28 for the S&P 500. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s premium valuation is expected, given its robust growth on the services front, as it also strengthens its hardware products with AI. Its ability to generate and return value through stock buybacks while offering a 0.44% dividend also underscores why it is a solid long-term growth stock.\nAnalysts on Wall Street believe Apple is a strong buy with an average price target of $248.90, implying a 9.32% upside potential from current levels. Overall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. According to the Insider Monkey database,\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0is the top shareholder of the company, with a position worth $84.25 billion\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc.

With a six-core central processing unit, the A17 Pro would boost CPU performance by 30% compared to the current generation iPad minis and is central to running Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI software.\nApple said it would roll out the first set of AI features in the U.S. version of the English language this month through a software update with iPadOS 18.1.\nThe features will be available for iPads with A17 Pro or M1 chips and later generations, Apple said, adding it will roll out additional features including image-generation tools, Genmoji and ChatGPT-powered capabilities over the next several months.\nApple in September unveiled its long-awaited, AI-boosted iPhone 16 lineup, but with the AI features still in test mode, the company failed to excite some investors while early sales data raised some questions around demand.\nStill, research firm Canalys on Monday said the iPhone 16 would help Apple's sales in the fourth quarter and drive momentum into the first half of 2025, after Apple reached a record high third-quarter shipments.\nThe iPad mini, starting at $499, is available for pre-orders starting on Tuesday and will begin arriving to customers and Apple store locations next week, Apple said.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)\n"

Targeting Google's partnerships with smartphone manufacturers including Apple, the lawsuit is likely to have major financial reprecussions should the case result in changes in revenue-sharing rules. According to Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, the legal procedure could potentially take up to three to eight years to clear out, with Apple losing one-third of its U.S. Google income. Lee highlighted that, while the potential income loss remains alarming, and in the near-term sales of the iPhone 16 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence have become critical. With around half of Apple's yearly profits coming from the iPhone, it is still the biggest revenue source for the business.

        "Text": "In August 1997, Apple was on the edge of collapse. Its finances were in shambles and the tech giant that once stood at the forefront of innovation was nearing bankruptcy.\nEnter Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, Apple's longtime rival, who unexpectedly became the story\u2019s hero. Gates stepped in with a $150 million investment, a move that saved Apple and became one of the most talked-about moments in tech history.\nDon't Miss:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\"Apple was in very serious trouble,\" Steve Jobs admitted at the 2007 D5 tech conference alongside Gates. At the time, Jobs had just returned to Apple and found the company desperately needing help. His willingness to reach out to Gates \u2013 someone who had been a fierce competitor \u2013 marked a turning point for the company. As Jobs explained during the conference, \"Apple was very weak and so I called Bill up and we tried to patch things up.\"\nMicrosoft\u2019s investment was more than just financial support; it represented a shift in mindset. According to Jobs, \"Apple didn't have to beat Microsoft. Apple had to remember who Apple was because they'd forgotten who Apple was.\" This mentality allowed both companies to coexist, with Microsoft becoming the largest software developer for Apple's Mac platform.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nWhen Jobs announced the deal at the 1997 MacWorld conference, Gates made an appearance via satellite to a chorus of boos from the audience. But for both companies, it was a win. Microsoft gained a business opportunity, while Apple got the boost it needed to stay afloat. Reflecting on the investment a decade later, Gates said, \"That's worked out very well.\"\nIn an iconic moment, Steve Jobs publicly thanked Gates for his help, telling him, \"Bill, thank you. The world's a better place.\" This gratitude was even immortalized on the cover of Time Magazine, a symbol of the profound impact this partnership had on the tech world.\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nDespite a very public rivalry, the investment marked a turning point for Apple and the personal relationship between Gates and Jobs.\nIn a 60 Minutes interview with Charlie Rose, Gates recalled visiting Jobs on his deathbed and grew emotional. Reflecting on their relationship, Gates explained: \u201cHe and I, in a sense, grew up together. We were within a year of the same age and we were kind of naively optimistic and built big companies. And every fantasy we had about creating products and learning new things \u2013 we achieved all of it. And most of it as rivals. But we always retained a certain respect and communication, including even when he was sick.\u201d\nThough the deal raised some eyebrows, it wasn't the end of competition between Apple and Microsoft. Both companies continued to thrive, shaping the tech industry\u2019s future together.\nTheir collaboration was a powerful reminder that rivals can find common ground, even in the most unexpected circumstances.\nRead Next:\nGroundbreaking trading app with a \u2018Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market \u2013 here\u2019s how to get equity in it with just $500\nBeating the market through ethical real estate investing' \u2014 this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors \u2013 here\u2019s how to join with just $100\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Latest reports, first published by news platform Bloomberg, suggest that the company plans to launch iOS 18.1 and Apple Intelligence later this month at an event that will also debut new Macs and an iPad mini, with shipments starting in early November. Per the news publication, this represents a moving away from the annual product upgrade cycle. Apple stock has been impacted by concerns around slowing demand for new iPhones as well as delays in the release of Apple Intelligence on new devices. Apple Intelligence is a suite of AI features that the company is marketing for the new devices that run on AI-optimized chipsets.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) hit an all-time intraday high Tuesday as Wall Street analysts issued bullish outlooks on the stock ahead of the release of Apple Intelligence.\nApple shares reached $237.49 on Tuesday before paring gains, eclipsing its prior record of $237.23 on July 15. The stock's climb put it further ahead of Nvidia (NVDA) as the world's most valuable company after Nvidia's gains earlier in the week jeopardized the iPhone maker's lead.\nApple shares closed the trading day up 1.1% to $233.85. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) fell around 4.5% Tuesday amid trade tensions in the semiconductor sector.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley (MS), Bernstein, and Evercore ISI have reiterated their Buy ratings on Apple stock this week. Positive preliminary iPhone shipment data posted by International Data Corporation (IDC) showed strong demand for Apple's previous smartphone models. Sales were also helped by Apple's rollout of the iPhone 16.\n\"Despite the staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence in markets outside the U.S., Apple will continue to grow in the upcoming holiday season,\" said Nabila Popal, IDC's data & analytics senior director, in a statement Monday. IDC data released Monday showed global iPhone shipments rising 3.5% in the third quarter from last year.\nThe news comes amid concerns over weak demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 lineup. Wall Street analysts initially interpreted shorter shipping times for the iPhones as an omen. The thinking was that if customers could easily get their hands on the new iPhones, then there was an oversupply of the phones available to purchase versus last year, Yahoo Finance\u2019s Daniel Howley reported. Jefferies last week downgraded Apple stock from Buy to Hold, citing doubts over whether its newly AI-enabled phones will live up to expectations. But Morgan Stanley said in a note to investors Monday that Apple was simply better prepared for the iPhone 16 release than past launches.\n\u201cOur supply-chain checks suggest that this cycle, Apple has asked its suppliers to prepare component inventories earlier than typical patterns to avoid supply constraints, in contrast to past cycles where supply shortages kept new model iPhone Pro/Pro Max supply/demand imbalanced for months,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Erik Woodring wrote. \u201cWe believe that better supply conditions are one of the contributing factors to why iPhone lead times are shorter this cycle than in recent cycles.\u201d\nApple released its new iPad mini equipped to run its suite of AI features, Apple Intelligence, on Tuesday. Apple will begin its rollout of Apple Intelligence on Oct. 28, though Morgan Stanley notes that more significant updates will come in December and then again in March of 2025.\nDespite a rocky start to 2024 \u2014 from struggling iPhone sales and layoffs to clashes with antitrust regulators at home and abroad \u2014 Apple stock is up 31% from last year, rising 3.6% over the last week alone. Analysts see the stock climbing further to $245.40 over the next 12 months, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nApple is set to report earnings Oct. 31, and Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect earnings to rise 9% from last year to $1.59 per share. Some 40 analysts recommend buying the stock, while 19 have a Hold rating and two recommend selling shares, Bloomberg data shows.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion,\" Trump added, quoting his call with Cook.\nLast month, Apple lost a long-running court battle with the European Union, resulting in Apple's being forced to pay 13 billion euros ($14.08 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, as part of a wider crackdown. Earlier this year, the company was hit with a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.\n\"Tim, I got to get elected first. ...

        "Author": "  Gabrielle Coppola and Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. worked with Chinese automaker BYD Co. for years as part of its now-canceled car project, developing long-range batteries that helped lay the groundwork for technology used today, according to people familiar with the situation.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan\u2019s Capital Into Chaos\nDrug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives\nInside the \u2018Utopias\u2019 of Mexico City\nCities Look to AI to Flag Residents\u2019 Trash and Recycling Mistakes\nOne City\u2019s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided\nApple and the Shenzhen-based company teamed up around 2017 to build a battery system using lithium iron phosphate cells, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the effort hasn\u2019t been disclosed. The technology was designed to be longer-range and safer than typical electric-vehicle batteries at the time.\nThough Apple doesn\u2019t own any of the technology used in BYD\u2019s current Blade batteries, the partnership shows just how far the iPhone maker went in its efforts to produce a car. The tech titan spent roughly $1 billion a year over the past decade on the vehicle project \u2014 often seen as one of the company\u2019s \u201cnext big things\u201d \u2014 before scrapping it in February.\nThe technology that Apple developed with BYD would have been highly customized for the once-planned vehicle, according to the people. As part of the secret partnership, Apple engineers brought expertise in advanced battery packs and heat management, they said. BYD contributed manufacturing know-how and advancements using lithium iron phosphate cells \u2014 better known as LFP.\nSpokespeople for Apple and BYD declined to comment on the joint battery work. But BYD said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe concept for the Blade battery originated with BYD engineers, who independently developed this LFP Blade battery. BYD holds complete property rights and patent rights for the Blade battery.\u201d\nToday, BYD\u2019s entire car lineup is powered by the Blade system, which uses a battery pack design that people involved in its development say was informed by lessons from the Apple work.\nThe seeds of Apple\u2019s BYD collaboration were planted about a decade ago, when the US company was seeking core technologies for its car. BYD engineers previewed early versions of the Blade battery to Apple executives, who admired the technology\u2019s safety and energy storage capabilities. Apple ultimately sought customizations that could enhance the range of an EV, the people said.\nAt the time, Cupertino, California-based Apple had already been working on several different batteries, using elements like nickel and alkaline. It had also been investing millions of dollars in battery pack design and engineering to squeeze in as many cells as possible. The two companies sought to combine the separate pack and cell efforts to produce a safe, long-range battery system for the Apple vehicle.\nOn the Apple side, the tie-up was led by Alexander Hitzinger, a former senior Volkswagen AG and Porsche executive who oversaw product design for the car project from 2016 to 2019. The company also had enlisted Mujeeb Ijaz, a veteran of the failed American battery startup A123 Systems LLC who worked at Apple from 2014 to 2020.\nIjaz oversaw a team of about 50 battery engineers working on the project. His counterpart at BYD was Michael He, vice president of the company\u2019s battery business.\nThe Blade is now a signature feature in BYD cars \u2014 and a major selling point. The company used its improved range, relative safety and lower cost to generate sales of 3 million electric and hybrid vehicles in 2023, up from 179,054 three years earlier.\nIt\u2019s now the biggest automaker in China by sales and briefly surpassed Tesla Inc. to become the top seller of EVs globally. BYD founder and Chairman Wang Chuanfu, a battery engineer himself, is a billionaire.\nDespite years of working with BYD, Apple backed away from the partnership and considered systems from other battery makers, the people said. The overall car project suffered numerous delays, and the economics of the EV business eventually proved too daunting.\nWhen Apple canceled the car project, it marked a rare high-profile failure for the world\u2019s most valuable company. But the decade-long endeavor did prove useful in some ways. Beyond the battery insights gleaned from the effort, it helped with the development of products such as the Vision Pro headset and the Neural Engine AI processor now present in most Apple devices. The work also has contributed to the company\u2019s nascent push into robotics.\n--With assistance from Danny Lee.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating\u2014With Big Consequences\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs\nNeuralink Co-Founder\u2019s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit\nA Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work\nHow Spindrift Broke Through the Cluttered Seltzer Craze\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Apple stock downgraded by Jefferies, which says 'serious AI' smartphones are 2 years away",
        "Author": " Laura Bratton    ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) was snubbed by investment firm Jefferies (JEF) late Sunday. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple stock from Buy to Hold, citing concerns over inflated expectations for its new AI-enabled iPhones.\nLee said smartphone hardware is not yet advanced enough to accommodate the kind of high-tech artificial intelligence analysts and iPhone consumers are hoping for.\n\u201cNear-term expectations for iPhone 16 and even 17 are too high,\" Lee wrote in a note to investors Sunday night.\nBig Tech companies have raced to innovate generative artificial intelligence technologies and secure their footing in an AI-dominated market. Up until this summer, Wall Street worried if Apple could catch up to rivals such as Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), which rushed to release new AI chatbots and chips, while Apple CEO Tim Cook remained elusive about the iPhone maker's AI plans. Now that Apple set into motion its AI vision with the upcoming release of Apple Intelligence, its next hurdle \u2014 like its competitors \u2014 is proving that it can monetize those artificial intelligence plans.\nApple stock fell 2.3% Monday.\n\u201cUnlike AI servers, smartphones lack high-speed memory and advanced packaging tech that allow fast data transfer between AP and memory, thus limiting their AI capabilities,\u201d Lee said, adding, \u201cTo expect an accelerated smartphone replacement cycle now due to AI is premature, in our view.\u201d\nLee said that it will take two to three more years for manufacturers like Apple to create smartphone hardware that's capable of running artificial intelligence software smoothly.\nApple unveiled its suite of artificial intelligence tools, called Apple Intelligence, at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June. Apple\u2019s long-awaited AI debut, in addition to its reveal of a partnership with OpenAI, boosted the stock to record highs. It more than alleviated investor concerns over Apple\u2019s barrage of bad news earlier in the year \u2014 from struggling iPhone sales and layoffs to clashes with antitrust regulators at home and abroad. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan predicted a future in which Apple\u2019s AI-enabled \u201cintelliphones\u201d dominate the market.\nBut Apple\u2019s initial launch of its iPhone 16, equipped with hardware to run its Apple Intelligence features that begin rolling out this month, has so far disappointed Wall Street. Analysts say demand for Apple\u2019s latest smartphone is weaker than it was after past iPhone launches, citing shipping times as a metric. While both new and existing Apple customers are looking to buy the iPhone 16 for its faster connectivity, fewer cited Apple\u2019s upcoming AI features as a motivating factor, according to JPMorgan's (JPM) most recent consumer survey.\nTo be sure, Lee said Apple is well positioned to lead the AI smartphone market in the future. Lee said Apple \u201cis the only hardware-software integrated player that can leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe AAPL is the leader in mobile AI tech, and its chip-OS-AI integrated ecosystem puts it far ahead of the fragmented Android competition.\u201d\nSome 65% of Wall Street analysts covering Apple recommend buying the stock and see shares rising around 9% to nearly $245 over the next 12 months. Lee expects the stock to drop about 6% to $213.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia(NVDA, Financial) ended at an unprecedented high on Monday, bringing it within close distance of Apple (AAPL,Financial) as the most valuable company in the world. The economic value of Nvidia is at $3.39 trillion and thus, it is behind Apple's $3.52 trillion only, but ahead of Microsoft's $3.12 trillion. This jump attests to solid investors' belief in Nvidia's present and future AI chip products.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nEarlier this year, Nividia briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) to become the world's most valuable company. Nevertheless, the tech giants have since repositioned themselves thoroughly, and their market caps bounced around with more fluctuation for several more months.\nIndeed, Wall Street has placed Nvidia among critical contenders for the position of the market leader for next-gen AI tech, manufacturers of which include Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial), Amazon (AMZN, Financial), and Microsoft. TD Cowen analysts indicate that the investment environment in the AI space is competitive and calls for more Australia's needs to invest continuously, which investment is critical in preparing for potential obstacles in the burgeoning field.\nNvidia expects further sales growth even if it experiences a production slowdown of the Blackwell chips it is expected to release. Sales of other chips for artificial intelligence deployments are expected to remain steady at least. TD Cowen has placed Nvidia as their Top Pick for investment, and the firm reaffirms its price target of $165.\nBefore the reporting season starts emotions are also rather high: both Apple and Microsoft have increased their movements which led to S&P 500 record. Nvidia along with companies like Apple and Microsoft jointly hold appreciable weight at the S&P 500.\nAs we look ahead, Nvidia has forecasted revenue surge to almost $125.8 billion thanks to continued investments in AI data centres, according to LSEG data. Still, there is some wariness regarding the further stable growth of AI spending.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Deeply integrated into iPadOS 18, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and Apple-built generative models to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. Many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on device, and Private Cloud Compute offers the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers.\nThe first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available in U.S. English this month through a free software update with iPadOS 18.1, and available for iPad\u00ae with A17 Pro or M1 and later. Apple Intelligence delivers experiences that are delightful, intuitive, easy to use, and specially designed to help users do the things that matter most to them:2\nWith Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.\nSiri\u00ae becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience and gets a new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPad. With richer language-understanding capabilities, communicating with Siri is more natural and flexible. Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words, can maintain context from one request to the next, and now, users can type to Siri. Siri also has extensive product knowledge to answer questions about features on iPad and other Apple devices.\nIn Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description, and with the new Clean Up tool, they can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo \u2014 without accidentally altering the subject.\nAdditional Apple Intelligence features will be rolling out over the next several months:\nImage Playground allows users to create playful images in moments.\nImage Wand is a new tool in the Apple Pencil\u00ae tool palette that can transform a rough sketch into a polished image.\nEmoji will be taken to an entirely new level with the ability to create original Genmoji\u2122 by simply typing a description, or by selecting a photo of a friend or family member.\nSiri will be able to draw on a user\u2019s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. It will also gain onscreen awareness to understand and take action with users\u2019 content, as well as take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps.\nWith ChatGPT integrated into experiences within iPadOS 18, users have the option to access its expertise, as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities, within Siri and Writing Tools without needing to jump between tools. And privacy protections are built in so a user\u2019s IP address is obscured, and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. Users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and ChatGPT\u2019s data-use policies apply for those who choose to connect their account.\nEven Faster Connectivity\nWith faster wireless and wired connectivity, users can do even more on iPad mini while on the go. The new iPad mini supports Wi-Fi 6E, which delivers up to twice the performance than the previous generation,3 so users can download files, play games online, and stream movies even faster. Wi-Fi + Cellular models with 5G allow users to access their files, communicate with peers, and back up their data in a snap while on the go. Cellular models of the new iPad mini are activated with eSIM, a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, allowing users to quickly connect and transfer their existing plans digitally, and store multiple cellular plans on a single device. Customers can easily get connected to wireless data plans on the new iPad mini in over 190 countries and regions around the world without needing to get a physical SIM card from a local carrier. The USB-C port is now up to 2x faster than the previous generation, with data transfers up to 10Gbps, so importing large photos and videos is even quicker.\nIncredible Camera Experience\nGreat cameras, along with the incredibly portable form factor of iPad mini, enable powerful mobile workflows. The 12MP wide back camera delivers gorgeous photos, and with Smart HDR 4, they will be even more detailed and vivid. Utilizing the powerful 16-core Neural Engine, the new iPad mini uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically identify documents right in the Camera app and can use the new True Tone\u00ae flash to remove shadows from the document. The 12MP Ultra Wide front-facing camera in portrait orientation, with support for Center Stage\u2122, is great for all the ways customers use iPad mini.\nMagical Capabilities with Apple Pencil Pro\nApple Pencil Pro unlocks magical capabilities and powerful interactions, turning iPad mini into a sketchbook users can take anywhere. Apple Pencil Pro can sense a user\u2019s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. Users can roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they\u2019re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper, and with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark. Apple Pencil Pro features support for Find My\u00ae, and pairs, charges, and is stored through a new magnetic interface on the new iPad mini. iPad mini also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at a great value.\niPadOS 18 Brings Powerful and Intelligent New Features\nIn addition to the groundbreaking capabilities of Apple Intelligence, iPadOS 18 brings powerful features that enhance the iPad experience, making it more versatile and intelligent than ever. iPadOS also has advanced frameworks like Core ML\u00ae that make it easy for developers to tap into the Neural Engine to deliver powerful AI features right on device.\nDesigned for the unique capabilities of iPad, Calculator delivers an entirely new way to use Apple Pencil to solve expressions, as well as basic and scientific calculators with a new history function and unit conversions. With Math Notes, users are now able to type mathematical expressions or write them out to see them instantly solved in handwriting like their own. They can also create and use variables, and add an equation to insert a graph. Users can also access their Math Notes in the Notes app, and use all of the math functionality in any of their other notes.\nIn the Notes app, handwritten notes become more fluid, flexible, and easy to read with Smart Script and the power of Apple Pencil. Smart Script unleashes powerful new capabilities for users editing handwritten text, allowing them to easily add space, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting. And as users write with Apple Pencil, their handwriting will be automatically refined in real time to be smoother, straighter, and more legible.\nWith new Audio Recording and Transcription, iPad can capture a lecture or conversation, and transcripts are synced with the audio, so users can search for an exact moment in the recording.\nNew levels of customization come to iPad, and users have even more options to express themselves through the Home Screen with app icons and widgets that can be placed in any open position. App icons and widgets can take on a new look with a dark or tinted effect, and users can make them appear larger to create the experience that is perfect for them. Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, delivering quick access to new groups of a user\u2019s most-utilized controls. Users can even organize new controls from third-party apps in the redesigned Control Center.\nThe Photos app receives its biggest update ever, bringing users powerful new tools that make it easier to find what they are looking for with a simplified and customizable app layout that takes advantage of the larger display on iPad and helps users browse by themes without having to organize content into albums.\nUsers have new ways to stay connected and express themselves in Messages, with all-new animated text effects, redesigned Tapbacks, and the ability to schedule messages to send at a later time.\nBetter for the Environment\nThe new iPad mini is designed with the environment in mind, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards.

        "Author": "  Silin Chen ",
        "Text": "Tim Cook was hired in 1998 by Steve Jobs from Compaq, where Cook had been content in his role and initially hesitant to leave.\n\u201c[Jobs] told me a little about the design, enough to get me really interested,\"\u00a0Cook said in an interview with Charlie Rose. \"And he was describing what later would be called the iMac. And the way that he talked, and the way the chemistry was in the room, it was just he and I. And I could tell I can work with him.\n\u201cI looked at the problems Apple had, and I thought you know, I can make a contribution here. And working with him, and this is a privilege of a lifetime. And so all of a sudden I thought, I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m going for it.\u201d\nThis year marks Tim Cook\u2019s 26th year at Apple, where he\u2019s worked with and led the company from the edge of collapse to a tech titan valued in the trillions.\nRelated: Tim Cook's net worth: How much the Apple CEO's stock is worth\nCook still sticks to his morning routine, waking around 4 a.m. daily. \u201cI\u2019m an early bird,\u201d he said last year on the \"Dua Lipa: At Your Service\" podcast, adding that the peaceful hours of the morning give him the freedom to focus on what he finds most important.\nAs he approaches his 64th birthday this November, Cook remains active at Apple's helm. The company is working on several major development projects, including artificial intelligence and augmented reality advancements.\nApple plans to launch iOS 18.1 and Apple Intelligence on Oct. 28 and announce new Macs and an iPad mini in late October, Bloomberg reports.\nThe big potential associated with those projects may make a recent decision by him curious to some.\nNurPhoto/Getty Images\nOn Oct. 7 Jefferies downgraded Apple\u00a0 (AAPL) \u00a0to hold from buy with a price target of $212.92, up from $205, thefly.com reported.\nThe analyst likes Apple Intelligence long term and calls the company \u201cthe only hardware-software integrated player that can leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized artificial intelligence services.\u201d\nHowever, Jefferies warns that expectations for the iPhone 16 and 17 might be \"premature,\" pointing out that AI-capable smartphone technology could still be years from realization. That makes current projections for these models \"overly optimistic.\"\nRelated: Analyst resets Apple stock forecast ahead of crucial rollout\nBank of America said on Oct. 3 that iPhone Pro ship times were stable but below prior years.\nB of A thinks the initial demand could be lower due to the unavailability of Apple Intelligence at launch. The investment firm expects demand to increase after the AI features are available. The firm reiterates a buy rating and $256 price target on Apple shares.\nJP Morgan\u2019s Samik Chatterjee gave a similar review on Oct. 2. He said the iPhone 16 launch showed \"muted momentum\" for high-end models compared with previous cycles, likely due to the lack of AI features at launch.\nIn response, according to thefly.com, JP Morgan lowered its iPhone forecast to 126 million units for the second half of 2024 from 130 million.\nDespite the near-term adjustment, the investment firm remains optimistic about a strong AI-driven cycle in the medium term and reiterates an overweight rating with a $265 price target.\nRelated: Billionaire fund manager unveils bold Apple stock price forecast\nThe company disclosed on Oct. 2 that Cook and several other Apple executives recently sold stock in the tech giant.\nAccording to an SEC filing, Cook sold 223,986 shares valued at approximately $50.28 million.\nApple\u2019s stock price surpassed $200 a share in June and reached a record $236 in July. Cook sold his shares at an average price of more than $220.\nMore AI Stocks:\nApple stock slides as big iPhone 16 bet sputters\nAnalyst revisits Meta stock price target as Facebook parent ramps AI spend\nAnalyst reviews BlackRock stock rating after AI partnership with Microsoft\nOther executives who sold shares include Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who sold 59,370 shares for $13.5 million; Senior Vice President of Retail Deirdre O'Brien, who sold 61,019 shares for $13.8 million; and Katherine Adams, general counsel and senior vice president for legal and global security, who also sold 61,019 shares for $13.8 million.\nSome investors were surprised by Cook's decision to sell stock during the much-anticipated iPhone launch and early in the AI development cycle.\nHowever, investors should remember that executives, including CEOs, sell stock for many reasons. A significant share of executive compensation comprises stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs.\nFor instance, the shares Cook sold were awarded to him this year as part of a total shareholder return (\"TSR\") plan based on Apple's stock market return relative to other S&P 500 companies \"from the first day of Apple's fiscal year 2022 and ending with the last day of Apple's fiscal year 2024.\"\nFurther, Cook disclosed that he'd be selling shares via a rule 10b5-1 trading plan set up on May 21 when shares were trading at $192, well before the actual sale.\nExecutives use these plans to inform investors of planned transactions, giving them time to prepare. These plans also reduce the risk that an executive bases a decision to sell or buy on inside information.\nCook has also sold shares in the past, including in April and last October. These sales are detailed on Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTherefore, Cook's decision may be less because he thinks Apple shares are pricey and more because he's diversifying his wealth. After selling shares, he still\u00a0owns 3.28 million shares worth over $700 million.\nRelated: The 10 best investing books, according to our stock market pros\n"

To achieve this price, Apple would use cheaper materials and a less powerful processor, and it would not include the EyeSight feature that shows a user\u2019s eyes outside the headset.\nNext up would be a second-generation Vision Pro in 2026, and then potentially smart glasses (akin to Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans) and AirPods with cameras in 2027.\nThe same report offers an update on Apple\u2019s smart home strategy. The company hasn\u2019t had much success here, either, but there are reportedly plans for \u201can affordable iPad-like screen\u201d that could be placed around the house to watch TV, make FaceTime calls, and use apps.

        "Text": "It\u2019s been over a decade since legendary Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs left us, but his impact on the world of technology and beyond continues to resonate.\nOn Oct. 5, the anniversary of his passing, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to reflect on the journey of this tech visionary who transformed not just how we use computers, but how we live our daily lives.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nAre you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\nHow do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\nThe Early Days: A Spark Of Genius\nJobs\u2019 story begins in San Francisco, where he was born in 1955 and later adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. From an early age, he showed a keen interest in electronics, tinkering with gadgets in his family\u2019s garage.\nAs a teenager, Jobs\u2019 rebellious spirit and thirst for knowledge led him to Reed College. Though he dropped out after just one semester, he continued to audit classes that piqued his interest.\nOne of these was a calligraphy course, which might seem like an odd choice for a future tech mogul. But Jobs later credited this class with influencing Apple\u2019s groundbreaking approach to typography and design.\nSee Also: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do \u2014 to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor.\nMost Valuable Company Today Had Humble Beginnings\nThe story of Apple\u2019s humble beginnings in a garage has become the stuff of Silicon Valley legend.\nIn 1976, Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer Company. Their first product, the Apple I, was essentially a circuit board that hobbyists could use to build their own computers.\nHowever, the Apple II, released in 1977, really put them on the map.\nThe Apple II wasn\u2019t just a computer for geeks \u2013 it was a machine that regular people could use.\nApple today has a market capitalization of $3.448 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nThe Macintosh Revolution\nFast forward to 1984, and Apple was ready to change the world again with the Macintosh.\nThis was the first commercially successful computer to feature a graphical user interface (GUI) and a mouse.\nIf you\u2019ve ever used a computer with icons and windows (which, let\u2019s face it, is pretty much every computer nowadays), you can thank Jobs and his team for pushing this revolutionary idea into the mainstream.\nBut It Was Not Always Smooth Sailing\nIn 1985, after a power struggle with then-CEO John Sculley, Jobs left Apple, the company he had co-founded. It was a huge blow, but Jobs wasn\u2019t one to sit idle.\nHe went on to found NeXT, a company that aimed to create high-end computers for the education market. While NeXT didn\u2019t achieve the commercial success Jobs had hoped for, it would later play a crucial role in Apple\u2019s future.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nFrom Side Project To Animation Powerhouse\nDuring his time away from Apple, Jobs also bought a little computer graphics division from Lucasfilm. This would become Pixar Animation Studios.\nUnder Jobs\u2019 guidance, Pixar went from a tech company to an animation powerhouse, releasing groundbreaking films like \u201cToy Story\u201d and forever changing the landscape of animated storytelling.\n...And Then The Prodigal Son Returns\nBy the mid-90s, Apple was struggling. The company that had once been at the forefront of personal computing was floundering, with a confusing product line and declining sales.\nIn a twist of fate, Apple announced that it was acquiring NeXT in 1996, bringing Jobs back into the fold as an advisor.\nHe quickly became interim CEO (or \u201ciCEO\u201d as he jokingly called himself) and set about turning the company around.\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\nThe Apple Renaissance\nJobs\u2019 return to Apple marked the beginning of one of the greatest comebacks in business history. He streamlined the product line, focusing on simplicity and design.\nThe result? A string of iconic products that would redefine entire industries:\nThe iMac (1998): A colorful, all-in-one computer that made technology fun and accessible.\nThe iPod (2001): Not the first MP3 player, but the one that made digital music mainstream.\nThe iPhone (2007): A device that put the internet, a music player, and a phone in your pocket, changing the way we communicate forever.\nThe iPad (2010): Bridging the gap between smartphones and laptops, creating a new category of device.\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nThe Jobs Philosophy\nWhat set Jobs apart wasn\u2019t just his ability to create great products, but his unwavering commitment to certain principles:\nSimplicity: Jobs believed that technology should be intuitive and easy to use.\nDesign: He saw beauty in minimalism and insisted that even the parts users couldn\u2019t see should be well-designed.\nIntegration: Jobs pushed for seamless integration between hardware and software, creating ecosystems that just worked.\nHe once said, \"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn\u2019t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we\u2019ve done something wonderful [at Apple], that\u2019s what matters to me.\"\nThe Final Chapter\nIn 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Despite this setback, he continued to lead Apple, overseeing some of the company\u2019s most innovative years.\nHowever, his health struggles eventually led to him stepping down as CEO in Aug. 2011.\nOn Oct. 5, 2011, he passed away, leaving behind a legacy that had fundamentally changed multiple industries \u2013 computing, music, movies, telecommunications, and retail.\nTrending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nThe Legacy Lives On\nToday, Apple continues to be one of the world\u2019s most valuable and influential companies. While it has evolved under the leadership of Tim Cook, many of Jobs\u2019 core principles still guide the company.\nBut Jobs\u2019 influence extends far beyond Apple. His vision of technology as a tool to enrich our lives has shaped the entire tech industry. From the smartphones we carry in our pockets to the way we consume media, Jobs\u2019 fingerprints are everywhere.\nHe once said, \u201cThe people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.\u201d He was certainly one of those people, and the world is all the richer for it.\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\nRead Next:\nStudies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do \u2014 to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor.\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average?\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\nOn September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.\nAccording to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.\nHe believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.\nAs the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.\nMiller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.\nMiller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.\nNow that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company behind the iPhone, is one of the best stocks to buy for the long term. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nIn the FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple\u2019s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. The launch of iPhone 16 and iOS 18 is expected to drive strong financial results for the company for the rest of 2024.\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 10% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. According to the Insider Monkey database,\u00a0 Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\"\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL, Financial) is on course to roll out a new service, which may well be called Business Caller ID, sometime early next year. The service will allow users to recognize business callers easily. This will be a component of Apple Business Connect that will let companies sign up their name, logo, and department so that when callers identify them, there will be increased credibility.\nAccording to David Dorn, Apple's senior director of Internet Software and Services Product, it was developed to provide relevant information to businesses that will enable them to put forward the correct information to Apple users to help them engage the service and grow their business. Registered companies will have more control over how their business information is displayed across Apple services such as Maps, Messages, Siri, and Wallet to have a perfect fit in the Apple services continuum.\nThe service will be available to all companies without any discrimination based on their size. Companies will be able to register using a current Apple ID or obtain a new one at no cost. Given that it will be launched across over one billion Apple devices, its global base is visible, meaning that the target audience is equally diverse.\nBusiness Caller ID will work for calls and messages, Promotional emails, and even be connected to Apple Pay as the Visual Identity in supported markets. This unified approach should also improve the quality of the user experience, as Apple product users are likely to see a coherent business image in their various modes of communication at the beginning of the new year 2025 and beyond. It should also provide adequate safeguards against most spam and fraudulent messages.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Apple is also aiming to manufacture new iPad Air models and keyboards for release around the same time, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren\u2019t public.\nThe release will mark the first update to the iPhone SE since 2022, when Apple added 5G capability to the device. With the latest model, Apple will move away from the old home button design and transition to an edge-to-edge screen.\nThe SE overhaul will help Apple compete in the low-end smartphone market, where it faces tough competition from Android devices \u2014 especially in China. The current model costs $429, which is hundreds less than the standard iPhone but more expensive than many of its rivals. Modernizing the SE so it looks more like its higher-end siblings should help entice budget-minded shoppers and potentially win back market share lost to brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi.\nThe new SE phone is expected to support Apple Intelligence, an upcoming suite of AI tools that will also work with the iPhone 16 and the high-end versions of last year\u2019s iPhone 15. The new model will resemble the iPhone 14, including the notch cutout at the top. The current SE more closely resembles the iPhone 8, the last standard version to include a home button.\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\nThe new iPad Air models \u2014 codenamed J607 and J637 \u2014 will focus on internal improvements. Apple also is preparing an updated version of its Magic Keyboard accessory, codenamed R307 and R308, for both the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the new Air. These will bring some of the features of the iPad Pro keyboard down-market.\nEarlier this year, Apple updated the Air lineup with an M2 chip and added the 13-inch screen option. A new iPad mini \u2014 codenamed J410 \u2014 is coming too, potentially by the end of 2024.\nA revamped version of the iPad Pro was released at the same time as this year\u2019s iPad Air, but that higher-end device includes an M4 processor that has yet to come to other models. That means an update is less urgent given the chip is already a generation ahead.\nBeyond the new iPhone SE and iPads, Apple is also refreshing its Mac computer lineup. Updated models this year will include a revamped Mac mini as well as updated MacBook Pros and iMacs. They\u2019ll sport the M4 processor and highlight Apple Intelligence features. The M4 chip will come to the MacBook Air, Mac Studio and Mac Pro during 2025.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

In an investor note to clients, the analyst said the advisory was positive on the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence as Apple was the only hardware-software integrated player that could leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services. However, per Lee, smartphone hardware needed rework before being capable of serious AI with a likely timeline of 2026/27. The high expectations for iPhone 16/17 were premature, contended the analyst. The analyst further noted the expectations of 5% to 10% unit growth for the iPhone were unlikely to be met.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss.

Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August\u2019s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's \u2018Money Movers',\u00a0he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income.

The product lines include the iPhone, a series of smartphones running on the iOS operating system. It is the 5th most profitable stock on our list.\nThe Mac line consists of personal computers based on macOS, including laptops such as the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, as well as desktops like the iMac and Mac Pro. The iPad, a multipurpose tablet operating on iPadOS, includes models like the iPad Pro and iPad mini.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) operates primarily on a geographic basis, with reportable segments that include the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and the Rest of Asia Pacific.

Previously, the company updated major products like iPhones and Macs on a set schedule, unveiling software in June and launching devices in September and October.\nHowever, the growing range of products has made this approach impractical. As a result, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is adopting a staggered release strategy, as can be seen by its upcoming AI tool, Apple Intelligence, set to launch on October 28 with iOS 18.1. The shift aims to improve innovation and enable revenue generation outside the holiday quarter.\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 8 Most Profitable Tech Stocks Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other most profitable tech stocks right now.\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 10, Drew Pettit, Director of US Equity Strategy at Citi Research, shared his thoughts about the upcoming earnings season and its potential impact on the market. With the Dow and S&P 500 reaching new closing highs, Pettit raised the question of whether earnings would justify the current valuations. The technology sector has been on a tear, with many software names running up significantly in recent weeks. However, Pettit\u2019s warning suggests that investors should be cautious about getting too caught up in the hype. He noted that when there\u2019s a high bar, investors should be prepared for potential disappointments.\nPettit sounded a note of caution when it came to the tech sector, particularly software stocks. He noted that software has the highest bar within tech, not just in terms of growth expectations but also in terms of monetization. Many software companies are not seeing the expected growth in the next three years, which is already priced into their valuations. This mismatch between expectations and reality could create volatility in the sector.\nIn terms of specific guidance, Pettit expects companies to use the current uncertainty as an excuse to walk down expectations for Q4. This is a typical trend in US markets, where companies tend to set low expectations and then beat them. Pettit advises investors to focus on companies that can deliver on their promises.\nOverall, Pettit\u2019s comments suggest that investors should be cautious about the tech sector, particularly software stocks, and focus on companies that can deliver on their promises. He also emphasizes the importance of looking beyond the current quarter and focusing on long-term growth prospects.\nDan Flax, Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman is bullish on the technology sector, with a focus on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the next generation of workloads and are executing well on their product cycles. Flax expects concerns about cyclical headwinds to remain a factor but also sees select opportunities in the sector. He also noted that enterprise customers are looking to adjust to changes in the landscape cyclically and invest in transforming their organizations, which will drive technology spending in the second half of the decade.\nAs investors navigate the current market landscape, it is essential to approach the tech sector with a sense of caution. While the sector has been experiencing a significant upswing, investors should focus on companies that have a proven track record of delivering on their promises, rather than getting caught up in the hype surrounding certain stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 8 most profitable tech stocks right now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 40 largest technology companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 5-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Then we sorted the stocks in ascending order, according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds, as of Q2 of 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\u00a0\nTTM Net Income: $101.95 Billion\u00a0\u00a0\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 12.85%\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, known for its iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to influence consumer electronics and technology industries globally. The company has a loyal customer base and innovative hardware-software integration makes it a leader in consumer technology.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has achieved remarkable success with its Vision Pro, capturing 57% of the total value in its category globally in Q1, despite only holding a 17% unit selling share.\nOn June 28, the Apple Vision Pro was launched in major Asian markets including China and Japan, as well as key Western countries such as Germany, France, and the UK in September, which will potentially boost the company\u2019s market share.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has integrated various LLM models in its products that position it well in the AI competition and is a key driver of its success. By allowing users to select various LLM models, including ChatGPT, to utilize with Siri, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can generate revenue from the LLM that comes preloaded on the devices.\nThis approach ensures that the company can benefit from the growing demand for AI applications without needing to develop the best model. Analysts expect the company to increase its earnings by 15.16% this year. Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) innovative strategy, dominant position in the cloud and AI markets, and strong growth prospects make it an attractive investment opportunity.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of most profitable tech stocks right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Updated at 10:29 AM EDT\nApple shares moved lower in early Monday trading after a top Wall Street analyst issued a rare downgrade for the tech giant, citing concerns that its new push into artificial intelligence will be slowed by muted demand for handsets.\nApple\u00a0 (AAPL) , which in early June unveiled its version of AI, dubbed Apple Intelligence, is looking to leverage its dominance in the smartphone market to drive consumer demand for the new technology.\u00a0The tech giant launched its latest version of its signature iPhone in September and promised to roll out AI-powered features over the coming months.\nEarly reports, however, show overall demand for the iPhone 16 remains muted compared with previous launches, while rival smartphones from both Samsung and China-based rivals are taking larger chunks of sales from key markets in Asia.\nSome analysts, however, see the new iPhone 16, and the likely-improved iPhone 17, driving an upgrade supercycle that will boost handset sales and accelerate the takeup of Apple Intelligence technologies.\nApple is reportedly set to unveil its first Apple Intelligence features later this month, with the launch of its new iOS 18.1 operating system on Oct. 28. That would give first access to iPhone 16, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro users who update their software.\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee, who assumed coverage of Apple this week, isn't one of them, He says near-term expectations for iPhone sales are \"too high (and)\u00a0a lack of material new features and limited AI capabilities mean high market expectations (5%-10% unit growth) are unlikely to be met.\"\nLee lowered Jefferies' rating on Apple to hold from buy and put a $212.92 price target in place, citing the stock's rich valuation of 33 times earnings and the long time frame for AI rollouts.\n\"We like Apple Intelligence long term, as Apple is the only hardware-software integrated player that can leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services,\" Lee said. \"However, smartphone hardware needs rework before being capable of serious AI, likely by 2026/27.\"\nRelated: Apple has an iPhone 16 problem\nStill, Lee argues that Apple has a longer-term advantage in terms of tech and cost development over its Android-based competitors, particularly given its partnership with chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor\u00a0 (TSM) , and sees next year's iPhone 17 as ultimately driving stronger sales growth.\nMore AI Stocks:\nApple stock slides as big iPhone 16 bet sputters\nAnalyst revisits Meta stock price target as Facebook parent ramps AI spend\nAnalyst reviews BlackRock stock rating after AI partnership with Microsoft\n\"We believe AI-capable smartphone tech is likely 2-3 years away due to limitations in high-speed memory and advanced packaging tech,\" he said. \"[But] Apple's thin model (17 Air) in 2025 could attract more upgrade demand.\"\nRelated: Analysts question iPhone 16 demand pace as Apple stock extends slide\nApple is scheduled to report its fourth quarter results on Oct. 31, with early estimates suggesting earnings of around $1.60 a share on revenue of $94.4 billion.\nApple shares were last marked 0.66% lower in early Monday trading to indicate an opening bell price of $225.30, a move that would trim their one-month gain to around 1.9%.\nRelated: The 10 best investing books, according to our stock market pros\n"

        "Author": "  Fatima Gulzar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the best internet content stocks.\nAccording to\u00a0Grand View Research, The global digital content creation market value stood at\u00a0$25.6 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 2023 to 2030. In 2023, North America dominated the digital content market. The primary drivers are the increasing use of social media and the digital change occurring across different industries. According to a study by Kepios,\u00a062.3%\u00a0of individuals in the entire globe use social media. As of April 2024, the average daily usage is 2 hours and 23 minutes per this study. Kepios analysis reveals that the number of people using social media grew meaningfully during the first three months of 2024, and annual growth rates are still significantly more than 5%.\nContent creation is also being transformed by artificial intelligence. According to Custom Market Insights, the global market for AI-powered content creation was valued at\u00a0$2.3\u00a0billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% to reach USD 7.9 billion by 2033. Moreover, AI programs like GPT-4 are being used to generate graphics, music, and text. Gartner projects that 30% of all digital content will be artificial intelligence generated by 2025. This facilitates hyperpersonalization, which allows material to be personalized to specific consumers while also streamlining the content creation process.\nSecondly, the popularity of short-form video material is skyrocketing, emerging as a major trend in the content production industry. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok have paved the way for this movement. In 2024, 85% of marketers anticipate short-form videos to be the most successful type of social media content, according to a HubSpot survey. The snackable aspect of this format makes it ideal for grabbing the attention spans of increasingly transient internet consumers.\nThirdly, digital content is projected to become more interactive in the future. Advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are opening up greater opportunities for immersive experiences. The AR and VR market is expected to reach\u00a0$1.5\u00a0trillion by 2030, according to a PwC report.\nIf we take a broader view, according to the PWC\u2019s Global Entertainment & Media\u00a0Outlook\u00a02024-2028, there are a number of significant growth prospects in the industry, which is expected to reach US$3.4 trillion by 2028. Notwithstanding persistent upheavals and the necessity of reinventing company models, the industry presents substantial income opportunities. Growth is anticipated to be driven by advertising, with spending forecast to reach US $1 trillion by 2026 because of connected TV and internet advertisements. Due to market saturation, streaming services are being forced to investigate ad-supported business models and creative content. Revenues from gaming are predicted to surpass $300 billion by 2028, particularly in Asia Pacific. The industry is still thriving. Companies navigating shifting market dynamics will find more opportunities in high-growth regions and market categories.\nWe sifted through holdings of Internet Content ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Internet Content stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHundreds of millions of people use Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) hardware and software services to access a wide variety of internet content, making it one of the best stocks for internet content investors. Millions of people access the internet via the 1.8 billion Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gadgets that are in use globally. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an internationally recognized supplier of internet content due to its streaming service, Apple TV+, Apple Podcasts, and other media offerings.\nIn fiscal Q3 2024, the California-based tech behemoth revealed Apple Intelligence, an AI-powered personal system for its new iPhones, which might spark a supercycle of iPhone upgrades. The company\u2019s $85.8 billion in revenue was up 5% year over year as iPhone sales reached $39.3 billion, while Mac revenue increased 2% to $7 billion. The company\u2019s economic moat is supported by AAPL\u2019s solid financial history, which includes improvements in net income and revenue over the preceding ten years.\nMorningstar analysts increased their estimate of the company\u2019s fair value from $170 to $185 based on an increased projection of iPhone revenue. Experts predict that the iPhone market will expand significantly in 2025 and 2026 as a result of Apple\u2019s increasing artificial intelligence capabilities. However, considering that the present valuation accounts for an unsustainable 20% increase in iPhone revenue in fiscal 2025 owing to difficulties in China and slow upgrade cycles, they still believe the company\u2019s stock is expensive.\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nWarren Buffett\u2019s\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0is the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 400,000,000 shares worth $84.25 billion as of Q2.\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best internet content stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Apple (AAPL). This company, which is in the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.90%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Apple came out with earnings of $1.40 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 per share, representing a surprise of 4.48%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.53 per share, delivering a surprise of 1.32%.\nFor Apple, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +1.94% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 31, 2024.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a great stock to own since late September 2019. During that five-year stretch, its shares produced a 328% total return. This gain absolutely trounces the broader S&P 500.\nThe momentum has continued this year, as Apple is up 18% (as of Sept. 27). But investors care about what the future holds. Where will this consumer discretionary stock be in five years?\nApple's business model has shifted in the past several years. To be more specific, services have become a bigger contributor to financial success. Offerings like iCloud, Pay, TV+, and the App Store, among others, are a growth engine, posting 14% sales growth in the latest fiscal quarter (Q3 2024, ended June 29).\nEven better, services boast a stellar gross margin of 74%. And they provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for Apple, which is exactly what shareholders want.\nHowever, this remains a hardware company at its core. Sales of physical products represented 72% of overall revenue in Q3. These hardware devices are still key to Apple's success. The iPhone in particular accounted for 46% of Apple's sales last quarter.\nAlthough services are becoming more important, I think five years from now, products, especially the iPhone, will still be the main aspect of the company's financial performance. Consequently, the business will most likely look very similar to how it does today.\nBut artificial intelligence (AI) is set to feature more prominently. Apple just released its 16th lineup of iPhones. And these newer devices will be compatible with Apple Intelligence, the company's new AI-powered software that can help users summarize text, boost their writing skills, and edit photos. The hope is that AI can spur greater demand for new iPhone sales, but this hasn't been the case so far.\nApple might have been a wildly successful investment in the past five years. But I don't believe this will be true over the next five.\nThe reason I think this way partly has to do with the valuation. If you want to buy Apple shares, you'll pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.7. On the one hand, it's easy to argue that such a dominant business deserves a high multiple. After all, Apple possesses one of the world's strongest brands, is incredibly profitable, and is even a top holding for Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway.\nHowever, that P/E ratio is 22% higher than the stock's trailing five-year average. Expectations have outgrown the underlying fundamentals. Paying a premium valuation would make sense only if investors believed that Apple was going to register outsize growth in the years ahead. It's hard to be optimistic in this regard, though.\nCompared to five or 10 years ago, Apple is now a very mature enterprise. There are more than 2.2 billion active devices scattered across the globe. While this figure inches higher each quarter, there are simply fewer opportunities to get these products into more hands, especially the iPhone. Revenue is slated to increase at just a 5.8% yearly rate between fiscal 2023 and 2026.\nAnd even though the iPhone is arguably the single most successful product of all time, newer updates aren't as revolutionary as they once were. This doesn't incentivize consumers to switch to the newest model, which can pressure revenue growth. When it comes to AI, the jury is still out on whether or not people even want or need these new features. It could all prove to be hype.\nThere's a very good chance that the stock could underperform the broader S&P 500 over the next five years. And that's why I don't own shares.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 774% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 169% for the S&P 500.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 30, 2024\nNeil Patel and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $94.53 billion, indicating a 5.62% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.17% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, Apple possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nLooking at its valuation, Apple is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 29.4. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 15.42.\nOne should further note that AAPL currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.32. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Micro Computers industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.71.\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 185, this industry ranks in the bottom 27% of all industries, numbering over 250.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October.\u00a0Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nVenu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are \u201cfull.\u201d\n\u201cIf you see what\u2019s happening, numbers (earnings)\u00a0 have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don\u2019t want to get ahead of that.\u201d\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the \u201canchor\u201d of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves.\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9, \u00a0Wolfe Research\u2019s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a \u201csubstantial\u201d majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is \u201coff the table.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 delivery times are lagging behind historical trends, but analysts suggest this could be due to stronger supply and high-end buyers holding off for the upcoming Apple Intelligence.\n\u201cIn Week 3 of our Apple Product Availability Tracker, delivery lead times are showing trends which, if continued, will explain the weaker lead times for the Pro models in the initial weeks as only an aberration led by a combination of better supply mix as well as delay in pick up in momentum from higher-end consumers awaiting the release of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence,\u201d J.P. Morgan analysts, led by Samik Chatterjee, stated in a note to investors.\nShipping times for iPhone 16 base models in the U.S. improved to 10 days in week three, compared to 17 days the previous week. However, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models saw no change, remaining at 23 and 29 days, respectively. The trend in China mirrored this, with base models seeing faster delivery times while Pro versions stayed steady.\n\u201cIn aggregate, although overall lead times for the iPhone 16 models are still lower relative to iPhone 15 last year, narrowing of the gap between the two groups (Base vs. Pro) over the last week as well as steady lead times for the Pro models are highlighting the likelihood that the initial slower momentum in demand for the Pro models is correcting itself with the release of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence drawing closer,\u201d Chatterjee added.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s data echoed this sentiment. \u201ciPhone 16 lead times as of Sept 27th are still tracking lower than the past 3 iPhone cycles, but lead times for 16 Pro/Pro Max models are now extending/stabilizing across all regions that we track, an unexpectedly positive development,\u201d noted analysts led by Erik Woodring.\nInterestingly, lead times for the Pro and Pro Max have grown by two days since last week, a trend more in line with the iPhone 12 and 13 models, rather than the iPhone 14 and 15, which saw shorter wait times at this stage in the cycle. \u201cBut interestingly, iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max lead times have extended by 2 days since last Tuesday, an unexpectedly positive trend that more closely resembles the trajectory of the better-performing iPhone 12 and 13 Pro/Pro Max models,\u201d Woodring added.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\nHowever, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Nauman khan ",
        "Text": "Apple's (AAPL, Financial) CEO, Tim Cook recently sold 223,986 shares of Apple stock, netting over $50 million, according to a recent SEC filing. Tim often sells shares in October as part of his routine financial strategy, and these shares were granted as part of a performance-based award that evaluates Apple's return to shareholders against other S&P 500 companies.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with TSLA.\nJust two weeks ago, Tim was granted another 219,502 shares. Out of these, 54,876 shares are set to vest in one-third increments starting in April 2027, while the remaining 164,626 shares are tied to performance and are expected to vest on October 1, 2027. The actual vesting will depend greatly on how Apple performs financially between fiscal years 2025 and 2027, with outcomes ranging from no shares to double the target based on Apple's relative return to shareholders.\nCurrently, Tim holds more than three million shares of Apple, with an additional 1.3 million unvested RSUs, bringing the total value of his unsold stock to over $500 million. The majority of his compensation is made up of these stock grants, far exceeding his base salary and other benefits.\nTim's compensation included a base salary of $3 million, alongside $47 million in stock awards and $10.7 million in performance-based bonuses. He is also getting other benefits, including life insurance, vacation payout, and travel allowances worth an extra $2.5 million. Market watchers closely see this move in order to determine the secret reason behind this sale. However, this looks like a routine financial strategy.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) The Most Popular Stock Among Mutual Funds According To Goldman Sachs?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 List Of Stocks Popular With Mutual Fund Managers: Top 20 Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the list of stocks that mutual funds are buying according to Goldman Sachs.\nAs the fourth quarter of 2024 starts, the market is once again back to debating about the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts. The latter half of September saw some much overdue optimism on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve kicked off its rate cut cycle through a 50 basis point cut. Since the day of the rate cut and the close of September, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ index gained 2.6% and 3.5% respectively.\nHowever, the start of October saw the return of nervousness that investors have been dealing with since the start of the rate hiking cycle and worries of a recession. The S&P and the NASDAQ dropped by 1.1% and 1.5% after labor market data saw the US market add 254,000 in nonfarm payrolls and 8.040 million overall jobs measured by the Labor Department\u2019s JOLTS survey. Both of these releases beat economist expectations, leading to sharp drops in markets as investors now factored out a 50 basis point cut at the next meeting of the Federal Reserve.\nThe latest drops despite a strong labor market are indicative of how investors expect nothing but a perfectly balanced data set since in August, Magnificent 7 stocks, which are generally dependent on robust discretionary and corporate spending, lost $800 billion in market value after unemployment jumped by 4.3% in July for its highest value since September 2021.\nHowever, even though markets pared back their gains in October, the fact still remains that drops due to a strong labor market are nevertheless better than ones that follow a slow market. This is because the former scenario promises a robust economic outlook. Soon after the fresh labor data that caused jitters in October, investment bank Goldman Sachs was out with yet another 2024 target for the benchmark S&P index. The bank now expects the S&P to close 2024 at 6,000 points, a sizeable bump over its first 2024 target of 4722 points, with the latest estimate being its fourth revision of the 2024 target so far. The first revision saw the bank bump up 2024\u2019s S&P closing estimate to 5,100 points in late 2023, and two subsequent revisions saw further upside as it predicted that the index would close out at 5,200 and 5,600 points.\nThe latest revision now sees the bank estimate that the index will close at 6,000 points \u2013 for a 4.3% upside over the recent closing value of 5,751 points. It is based on the bank\u2019s optimism about the third quarter earnings cycle, as the index revision was followed by an upward earnings revision as well. Heading into earnings, Goldman believes that in 2025, the S&P\u2019s earnings per share will now sit at $268. This is a 4.7% upward revision from the bank\u2019s previous estimate of $256 and it assumes that earnings will grow by 11.2% next year over the 2024 earnings estimate of $241. This isn\u2019t the only growth estimate in the banks\u2019 latest market outlook since the report also sees it introduce an S&P earnings target for 2026. As per Goldman, in 2026, the S&P will deliver earnings per share of $288 to mark a 7.4% annual growth and a stronger 19.5% growth over this year\u2019s earnings.\nFor a market that first struggled with worries of a recession in August and is now re calibrating expectations for the interest rate cut cycle, it\u2019s important to see what\u2019s driving the bank\u2019s optimism. Led by chief US equity strategist David Kostman, analysts have built their optimism on the back of strong economic performance. In the note, Kostin comments that his firm\u2019s \u201cforward EPS estimates reflect a steady macro outlook.\u201d He adds that \u201cthe primary driver of the upward revision to our 2025 EPS estimate is greater margin expansion,\u201d since the \u201cmacro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.\u201d This backdrop, as you might expect, is driven by bullish expectations about the US economy. As per Kostin, the 2025 EPS estimate is driven by Goldman\u2019s assumption that \u201csales will grow by 5%, roughly in line with nominal GDP growth (vs 4% previously).\u201d\nYet, despite the optimism, the analysts are also wary about short term turbulence in the stock market. October is the last month before a hotly contested US presidential election, and investors have also felt jitters from ongoing hostilities in the Middle East. Consequently, Kostin warns that as \u201ceveryone is in the pool\u201d right now, with the election looming and the mutual fund fiscal year ending on October 31st, stocks could see some shifts as the big players rotate their positions. As an example of the volatility that the market is facing right now, the analyst points out that the Chicago Board\u2019s CBOE volatility index jumped by 30% over the past five trading days to signal that \u201cvolatility is no longer the coach on the sidelines: it is the player on the field.\u201d\nSpeaking of mutual funds, they\u2019ve done quite well this year. We took a look at the brief performance of mutual funds as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Top Fund Manager Stock Picks: 25 Best Overweight Stocks. This revealed that as per BofA, during the first quarter, 64% of actively managed mutual funds beat their benchmarks during Q1, for their best set of performance over the past 17 years. This also marked a significant improvement over last year\u2019s performance when 38% of these funds had beaten the benchmarks.\nThe Fed\u2019s interest rate cut also means that hedge fund shifted their positions. Financial services firms and banks in particular benefit from interest rate cuts as their deposit costs drop and they can earn more by maintaining existing rates. Consequently, according to Goldman, in the week before the Fed interest rate cut, hedge funds bought banks and financial services stocks at the fastest pace since 2023. This falls in line with what UBS Wealth Management\u2019s Brad Bernstein shared in his comments after the rate cut when he explained that lower rates make financials attractive since \u201cthe improving yield curve for their balance sheet and what that means for their ability to lend at higher rates and pay cheaper rates on cash savings.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 top stocks that are popular with mutual fund managers, we used the bank\u2019s list of 20 Russel 1000 stocks that mutual fund managers had grown their positions in during Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked by the number of funds that increased their portfolio allocation versus those that had decreased it.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nAn investor confidently checking stock market fluctuations on a laptop computer.\nNumber of\u00a0 Mutual Funds: 31\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer technology company that is a global giant. Its best selling and most valuable product is the iPhone lineup. The iPhone is responsible for 52% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s sales, and the firm\u2019s hypothesis is dependent on its ability to generate stable revenue through regular upgrade cycles. Its resources, as evidenced by a whopping $28.3 billion in cash and equivalent also mean that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is able to continuously innovate its product lineup. The biggest example of this is the MacBook lineup where the firm has successfully replaced x86 processors made by Intel with its custom chips. This has allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to de link its supply chain from an unreliable partner and benefit from tighter ecosystem control. However, the firm\u2019s reliance on the iPhone means that if the phone disappoints, its shares tumble. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock lost 3% in mid September after an analyst note speculated that 2024 iPhone sales were lower over its predecessor over the year ago comparable period.\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cRecent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks popular with mutual fund managers according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2025?",
        "Author": "  Lawrence Rothman, CFA, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors have a lot to celebrate this year, with the S&P 500 gaining 20%. While it's nice to receive high returns, it's also a good time to examine your holdings heading into the new year.\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed the market by 2 percentage points since the start of the year, increasing 18.3%. However, the company has had a lot of success in the past and richly rewarded shareholders. After all, the company has a $3.5 trillion market capitalization, one of the few that have crossed the trillion-dollar threshold.\nCan Apple's shares regain their market-beating ways? The answer lies in examining the company's long-term prospects and valuation.\nApple's iPhone accounts for a large portion of the company's sales. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, which ended on June 29, the product represented 52% of Apple's $296.1 billion top line.\nFacing intensifying competition, including from China-based Huawei, iPhone sales have been dropping, In the most recent quarter, they were down 1% to $39.3 billion.\nMore troubling is that the product has also been losing market share. Apple's iPhones accounted for 15.8% of smartphone shipments in the second quarter, down from 17.3% in the previous quarter. A year ago, it held a 16% share.\nApple recently released a new version of the iPhone that it hopes can reverse the trend. It has new features, including artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Whether that will cause existing customers to upgrade to the expensive models or cause users to switch to an iPhone remains unclear, however. It's too early to make a judgment on how the new features will impact the top line. Although initial sales reportedly have been disappointing, investors should have more information when Apple reports quarterly earnings in about a month.\nOne bright spot for Apple remains sales from providing services. These include advertising, supporting products, cloud services, the App Store, and payments.\nIn the latest quarter, service sales grew 14.1% to $24.2 billion. And this category has a much higher gross margin than products, 74% versus 35.3%.\nHowever, the U.S. government and several states have claimed Apple's iPhone has an illegal monopoly that makes it too difficult for consumers to switch phones and develop apps. This could result in a drawn-out process, and the outcome remains uncertain. The cases have the potential to hurt Apple's service business' profitability.\nMeanwhile, after a dearth of brand-new product categories, Vision Pro, its widely publicized product launched earlier this year, doesn't seem to have gained much traction. With a high price tag for the combined augmented and virtual reality headset, sales seem to have been disappointing. Management now expects to sell 450,000 units in the first year, well below its initial 800,000 estimate.\nThe shares' gain over the last year has led to a richer valuation. Apple's stock has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34 compared to about 28 a year ago.\nThe stock also sells at a higher multiple than the S&P 500's P/E of 30 , making it more expensive than the overall market.

        "Title": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Oct. 28?",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Over the summer, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) previewed what some analysts called its most important product since the iPhone: Apple Intelligence.\nThe artificial intelligence features the tech giant showed off at its Worldwide Developer's Conference in June highlighted the advantage Apple gains by controlling both the hardware and operating system of its smartphones. It's able to seamlessly integrate data and take action across multiple apps. Apple Intelligence will make Siri a much more capable assistant, improve users' communication with generative text and images, and simplify photo editing.\nUnfortunately, Apple Intelligence wasn't quite ready to ship to the public when the new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro launched last month. Users will have to wait for the release of iOS 18.1, which reports indicate is slated for Oct. 28. At that point, owners of the newest iPhones will get a taste of the coming AI capabilities, but it'll still take months before all the features Apple promised over the summer make it to their devices.\nThe question for investors now is whether they should buy the stock before the broader public starts to see what Apple Intelligence really has to offer.\nThe biggest impact Apple Intelligence will have on Apple in the near term will likely be on its iPhone upgrade rate. Only the new iPhone 16 devices and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are capable of supporting these new software capabilities. In other words, only a small percentage of the iPhones in use before this year's release are compatible with the new AI features.\nIf early Apple Intelligence users find the new features compelling, that could drive more iPhone users to upgrade their devices sooner than they otherwise would have.\nWhile observers won't know how the iPhone 16 launch went until Apple releases its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Oct. 31, the early indications have been mixed. Lead times on iPhone 16 shipments stayed relatively short in the early days of the launch, but remained extended through the end of September, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. Overall, that bodes well for the iPhone 16's sales trajectory.\nThe slow rollout of Apple Intelligence features over the next few months could result in more steady demand as the case for upgrading grows. That could lead to several quarters of better-than-expected iPhone unit sales. That said, analysts are already expecting that unit sales will increase by 5% to 10%.\nApple laid significant groundwork before its rollout of Apple Intelligence, and the tech could form the foundation of another successful services business for the company.\nApple prefers to keep your data on your device. Some Apple Intelligence features require it to offload processing to the cloud, though, which means sending your data to a server. That's how it's integrating ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence. In order to maintain users' data privacy, it built a system it's calling Private Cloud Compute.\nApple could enable developers to build AI apps using Private Cloud Compute to maintain data privacy. That could open the door for Apple to take its standard revenue cut from app sales, or charge for compute, while funding the build-out of its data center capabilities.\nAlternatively, the company may maintain control over AI features on the iPhone and charge users directly. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee thinks Apple could charge users $10 per month for its AI features. Considering OpenAI and other popular generative AI services charge even more for premium features, that's certainly within the realm of possibility.\nApple's ability to monetize its artificial intelligence services over the long run holds much more potential than a boost in upgrade rates in the near term. Still, if Apple does surprise investors with higher-than-expected iPhone unit sales on Oct. 31, it could drive the stock higher.\nWhile shares currently trade at a premium valuation of 30.5 times expected 2025 earnings, the stock is worth the price. Given the massive free cash flow the business generates (much of which it's plowing into share buybacks) and the potential for continued services revenue growth fueled by Apple Intelligence and its AI infrastructure, it's worth buying the stock. And while the public debut of Apple Intelligence on Oct. 28 might not have a huge impact on near-term results, it's worth buying before the news as it still holds some upside.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Munsif Vengattil ",
        "Text": "By Munsif Vengattil\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - Extensive damage from a fire at Tata Group's Apple (AAPL) iPhone component plant in southern India could hamper production ahead of a festive season sales surge, an industry watcher and a source said, forcing the U.S. firm's suppliers to arrange critical parts from China or elsewhere.\nThe weekend blaze has caused an indefinite production halt at Tata's Hosur plant in Tamil Nadu, the only Indian supplier of iPhone back panels and some other parts for both contract manufacturer Foxconn in the country and its own iPhone assembly at another plant.\nHong Kong-based Counterpoint Research told Reuters it estimates local sales of 1.5 million units of iPhone 14 and 15 models during the Indian festive season which runs from late October to early November, with Apple struggling to fulfil as much as 15% of that demand due to the fire.\n\"There will be a 10-15% impact on production of older iPhone models from India. Apple could offset that impact by importing more components, and by re-routing more export inventory towards India,\" said Neil Shah, a co-founder of Counterpoint, which has for years tracked Apple's global shipments.\nApart from local sales, Tata, one of India's biggest conglomerates, also exported iPhones to the Netherlands and United States as well as some parts to China, worth more than $250 million overall, in the year to Aug. 31, commercially available customs data shows.\nTata declined to comment.\nApple suppliers typically carry a three- to four-week stock of back panels, Counterpoint said. An industry source with direct knowledge of the matter estimated, however, that Apple was likely to have stock for eight weeks, and therefore would not see an immediate impact.\nHowever, they added that if the production suspension continues, the U.S. company could set up another assembly line in China or add shifts there to secure parts for India's iPhone manufacturers.\nSupply chain disruptions more generally have cast a shadow over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to attract foreign investors to \"Make in India\", especially in the electronics sector.\nApple has been diversifying beyond China but last year separate fire incidents in India caused suppliers Foxlink and Pegatron to briefly halt operations, with authorities finding much of the fire safety equipment at Foxlink's facility was not functional. Contractors Wistron and Foxconn have also been hit by labour unrest in recent years.\n\"These are temporary setbacks,\" said Prabhu Ram, vice president at Cybermedia Research. \"Continued efforts to improve safety and operational standards are crucial for strengthening India's position as an emerging global electronics manufacturing hub.\"\nTata is among Apple's newest suppliers in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total global iPhone shipments this year, up from 12-14% last year.\nThe fire-hit plant employed 20,000 workers. Another unit in the same Tata complex was due to start making complete iPhones later this year and it is unclear if the incident will cause this to be delayed.\nTata has another iPhone plant near Bengaluru, which it acquired from Wistron last year, and a second one in Tamil Nadu near Chennai, which it is set to acquire from Pegatron.\n(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Kalra, Kirsten Donovan)\n"

        "Title": "Is Most-Watched Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) Worth Betting on Now?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, indicating a change of +5.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.5%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.54 indicates a change of +13.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $94.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $390.59 billion and $422.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +8.1%, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Right now, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's largest company by market cap. However, investors need to be aware of some problems under the hood.\nInstead of Apple, I think there are much better buys right now, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). These three provide significant long-term upside that should allow them to outperform Apple.\nApple reached the top of the rankings of the world's largest companies with shockingly low revenue growth. Sales of iPhones haven't increased meaningfully since the pandemic began, and investors put a lot of hope into the iPhone 16 being the generation that turns it around, mainly because of its Apple Intelligence integration. But the latest reports say that its sales are below expectations, which could spell disaster for the stock.\nIt trades at 34 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings. That's a premium investors would expect to pay for a company that's growing rapidly.\nIn Apple's latest quarter, however, sales only grew by 4.9% and earnings per share (EPS) by 10.2%. Those aren't figures that support the stock's lofty valuation.\nThe immediate future looks slightly better, but not enough to justify today's price. In fiscal 2025, ending Sept. 30, 2025, Wall Street expects 8% higher revenue and 17% EPS growth. Compared to the following three options, Apple stock doesn't look attractive.\nInstead, I would urge you to consider Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (and many other companies as well).\nLet's start with Nvidia. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering artificial intelligence (AI), and demand doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.\nAlphabet is Google's parent company, and its market dominance among search engines allowed it to capitalize on advertising in one of the most lucrative areas on the internet.\nMeta Platforms is the parent of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, and it also generates a lot of its money from ads on its platforms.\nAll three of these companies are far outperforming Apple in revenue and EPS growth.\nDespite doing substantially better than Apple, two of them don't hold a premium in comparison to it, while Nvidia isn't that much more expensive.\nAs an investor, I'm looking for companies with sustainable business models, faster growth, and lower stock valuations. Compared to Apple, both Meta and Alphabet achieve that, so buying those two instead makes a lot of sense.\nNvidia isn't cheaper now, but its prospects are far more lucrative. While its days of increasing revenue at a triple-digit pace are over, if it keeps up its current rate, it will still post impressive growth.\nIn its 2025 second quarter (ending July 28), Nvidia grew revenue 15% sequentially, and its third-quarter projections indicate sales will rise another 8.3% over the previous period. Apple can't muster this kind of increase year over year, yet Nvidia is doing it one quarter after another.\nIf the stock price doesn't move, this will rapidly drive down Nvidia's valuation. However, with AI being such a hot investment topic, the stock will continue to be strong and will likely maintain its premium over other tech stocks.\nAs a result, its stock performance will be closely tied to its revenue and EPS growth, which will easily allow it to outperform the iPhone maker.\nApple is a great company, but it isn't the juggernaut it used to be. Investors should start looking for other investment opportunities.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.5% in premarket trading Monday after Jefferies analysts cut their rating on the stock from Buy to Hold. The investment bank set a price target of $212.92 on Apple, suggesting a potential downside of around 6% from the last closing price.\nThe downgrade comes as Jefferies analysts raise concerns about the overestimated market expectations for the upcoming iPhone 16 and 17 models. More concretely, the tech giant\u2019s heavy reliance on iPhone sales, which accounted for 52% of the company's revenue in fiscal year 2023, was highlighted as a key factor for the revision.\nThe analysts believe that the market's anticipation of 5%-10% unit growth for the new iPhone models is unrealistic due to a lack of significant new features and limited AI capabilities. Initial demand for the iPhone 16 is projected to be weaker than expected, with forecasts indicating flat volume growth for the second half of calendar year 2024 compared to the iPhone 15, and only a 2.5% growth in lifecycle volume for the iPhone 16.\nThe report also casts doubt on the near-term impact of AI technology in smartphones, suggesting that AI-capable smartphone technology is \u201clikely 2-3 years away.\u201d The current limitations in high-speed memory and advanced packaging technology in smartphones restrict their AI capabilities.\n\u201cTo expect an accelerated smartphone replacement cycle now due to AI is premature, in our view,\u201d Jefferies analysts wrote.\nHowever, Apple is expected to introduce a new, thinner iPhone model, dubbed the \"17 Air,\" in 2025, which could stimulate upgrade demand.\nJefferies remains bullish about Apple's long-term AI capabilities, acknowledging the company as \u201cthe only hardware-software integrated smartphone player.\u201d\nBy the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026, Apple is estimated to have 490 million AI-capable iPhones in use, with the number potentially rising to 845 million by fiscal year 2027. Apple's OpenELM model and another language learning model, Ferret-UI, are expected to reinforce its leadership in mobile AI technology.\n\u201cWe believe AAPL is the leader in mobile AI tech, and its chip-OS-AI integrated ecosystem puts it far ahead of the fragmented Android competition,\u201d analysts noted.\nThe investment firm also highlights Apple's strategic partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), which gives Apple a long-term technological and cost advantage. This collaboration is anticipated to help Apple expedite the commercialization of AI-enabling technologies and secure lower costs for advanced nodes in comparison to its competitors.\nOn valuation, Jefferies notes that while Apple's stock appears elevated in the near term, especially with fiscal year 2024 earnings projections falling below consensus, there is potential for long-term upside driven by AI-related fee income.\nApple's fiscal year 2026 earnings are expected to surpass consensus, and the firm's upside valuation is based on the possibility of Apple charging a monthly fee for AI services, with a target of $306.99.\nRelated Articles\nApple shares tick lower as Jefferies cuts rating on rich valuation\nUS stock futures turn lower; Fed speakers, inflation and earnings in focus\n10-year Treasury yield hits 4%, keeping equity bulls in check\n"

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.03%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.21%.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.60, marking a 9.59% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $94.52 billion, up 5.61% from the year-ago period.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.04% lower. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Apple has a Forward P/E ratio of 29.96 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.26.\nWe can also see that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.36.

        "Text": "Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 3.6% in the morning session after Barclays analyst Tim Long highlighted data that tracks global iPhone availability and wait times, suggesting weak demand for the new iPhone 16. The analyst has an Underweight (Sell) rating and a price target of $186.Separately, the major indices declined (Nasdaq down 1.8%, S&P 500 down 0.9%) amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. NBC News reported (citing White House and Defense Department officials) that the U.S. \"has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.\" Lastly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told investors there is no \"preset course\" regarding the pace of future rate cuts. He added in a speech delivered to the National Association for Business Economics, \"Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course.\" While the markets could still be right about more rate cuts in the near term, Powell's comments added uncertainty to both the cadence and magnitude of cuts. Following these updates, the VIX index (or fear gauge) spiked as the reports created more uncertainty, which investors certainly don't like.\n\u00a0\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nApple\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 2 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nApple is up 21.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $224.76 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $234.82 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,003.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks in October. Since Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nTom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year \u201cwell beyond\u201d 5,700.\n\u201cBull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that\u2019s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.\u201d\nLee said that he\u2019s inclined to buy \u201crisks outright\u201d as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.\n\u201cSmall caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are making big moves on the back of latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may have reduced its iPhone 16 production for the December quarter by 3 million units, according to a supply chain check by Barclays. Analysts Tim Long and George Wang noted, \u201cWe believe AAPL may have cut roughly 3M units at a key semiconductor component for the Dec-Q, which, if confirmed, would be the earliest build cut in recent history.\u201d\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to roll out its Apple Intelligence features in the U.S. starting mid-October with the iOS 18.1 update. However, the Chinese-language rollout will not begin until 2025, with Europe seeing a similarly staggered introduction.\nBarclays believes iPhone shipments for the September quarter could reach 51 million units, assuming favorable channel fill. But the December quarter appears increasingly at risk due to recent order cuts, disappointing sell-throughs, a staggered Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence rollout, limited AI adoption outside the U.S., and minimal hardware differentiation. The firm maintains its Underweight rating on Apple.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\nHowever, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Apple's estimated fair value is US$233 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$234 share price, Apple appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n Analyst price target for AAPL is US$241, which is 3.1% above our fair value estimate\nHow far off is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for Apple \nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$123.0b\nUS$133.8b\nUS$163.8b\nUS$177.5b\nUS$186.4b\nUS$193.6b\nUS$200.3b\nUS$206.7b\nUS$212.8b\nUS$218.8b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x13\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ 3.88%\nEst @ 3.47%\nEst @ 3.18%\nEst @ 2.97%\nEst @ 2.83%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% \nUS$114.7k\nUS$116.3k\nUS$132.7k\nUS$134.1k\nUS$131.2k\nUS$127.1k\nUS$122.6k\nUS$117.9k\nUS$113.2k\nUS$108.5k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$219b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.5%) = US$4.7t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.7t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.3t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.6t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$234, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.157. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Apple, there are three fundamental aspects you should look at:\nRisks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Apple that you should be aware of before investing here.\nManagement:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for AAPL's future outlook?

        "Text": "(This Oct. 1 story has been corrected to say that Gjovik sued Apple last year, not in May, in paragraph 9)\nBy Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) - A U.S. labor board issued a complaint accusing Apple of violating employees' rights to organize and advocate for better working conditions by maintaining a series of unlawful workplace rules.\nThe National Labor Relations Board in the complaint announced late on Monday claims Apple required employees nationwide to sign illegal confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements and imposed overly broad misconduct and social media policies.\nThe complaint accuses Apple of \"interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of\" their rights under federal labor law.\nApple, in a statement provided by a spokesperson, said it has always respected its employees' rights to discuss wages, hours and working conditions, which is reflected in its employment policies.\n\"We strongly disagree with these claims and will continue to share the facts at the hearing,\" the company said.\nIf Apple does not settle the case, it will be heard by an administrative judge beginning in January. The agency is seeking to require Apple to rescind the allegedly unlawful rules and notify its entire U.S. workforce of their legal rights.\nAdministrative judges' decisions can be reviewed by the five-member labor board, whose rulings can be appealed to federal appeals courts.\nThe complaint stems from charges filed against Apple in 2021 by Ashley Gjovik, a former senior engineering manager at the company. Gjovik said various Apple rules, including those relating to confidentiality and social media use, deter employees from discussing issues such as pay equity and sex discrimination with each other and the media.\nGjovik also filed a lawsuit in California federal court last year accusing Apple of illegally retaliating against her for filing the NLRB complaints, which the company has denied. A judge on Tuesday dismissed the bulk of Gjovik's lawsuit, while giving her a chance to amend some of her claims.\nThe company is facing at least two other pending NLRB cases claiming it fired an employee at its Cupertino, California, headquarters for criticizing managers and illegally interfered with a union campaign at a retail store in Atlanta. The company has denied wrongdoing.\nThe NLRB in May ruled the manager of an Apple store in Manhattan unlawfully interrogated an employee about his support for a union. Two Apple stores in the U.S. have unionized since 2022, and unions are working to organize several other locations.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Bill Berkrot and Jamie Freed)\n"

        "Text": "In September, Apple released the new version of its computer operating system macOS 15, also known as Sequoia, which broke the functionality of several cybersecurity products, including those made by CrowdStrike and Microsoft.\nThree weeks later, on Friday, Apple released the first update to macOS 15, and it claims to have fixed those issues. In the macOS 15.0.1 release notes, Apple says that the update \u201cimproves compatibility with third-party security software.\u201d\nApple flagged the update in an email to TechCrunch on Thursday, and a spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up asking for more information.\nPatrick Wardle, the founder of macOS and iOS security startup DoubleYou and a longtime expert on Apple security and the developer of several free security tools for macOS, wrote on X that the macOS update includes \u201ca fix for the networking issues that plagued the initial macOS 15 release.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to any Apple apologist who blamed 3rd-party vendors, you deserve to be slapped with a large trout as this was an Apple bug reported before GM [golden master],\u201d Wardle wrote, referring to the first public release of the macOS 15 software.\nWhen Apple first released macOS 15, several cybersecurity professionals said they were unable to use some security tools, such as CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon and Microsoft Defender, because of an apparent bug in the new macOS.\nAt the time, CrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci said that the company was \u201cwaiting for a macOS Sequoia update\u201d to provide official support for its cybersecurity products on Apple\u2019s operating system.\nUgur Koc, a developer who works as a cloud engineer for cloud managed service provider Glueckkanja, said on X that the new macOS update \u201cresolves the issue with [Microsoft] Defender for Endpoint and other antivirus software, where the network filter was causing issues with the internet connectivity.\u201d\nMicrosoft spokesperson Emelia Katon said the company \"can confirm that MacOS 15.0.1 does fix network connectivity issues some customers may have experienced with Defender on MacOS 15.\"\nCrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci said the company \u201ccan confirm that the updates to MacOS 15.0.1 fixed the issues some customers may have experienced on MacOS 15.\u201d\nUPDATE, October 8, 10:43 a.m. ET: This story has been updated to include Microsoft's comment, and CrowdStrike's comment.\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Apple with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n Check out our latest analysis for Apple \nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Apple grew its EPS by 9.1% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. This approach makes Apple look pretty good, on balance; although revenue is flattish, EBIT margins improved from 29% to 31% in the last year. Which is a great look for the company.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Apple's future EPS 100% free.\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$3.5t company like Apple. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$2.2b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.06% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\nOne important encouraging feature of Apple is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Apple , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\nAlthough Apple certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s Dan Riccio, who oversaw the company\u2019s push into mixed-reality headsets and previously served as its hardware engineering chief, is retiring.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nDubai\u2019s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City\u2019s Infrastructure\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought\nThe Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan\u2019s Capital Is No Longer Working\nAs Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization\nThe Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City\u2019s Populous Outskirts\nThe veteran executive, a vice president who reports to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, is leaving Apple this month, according to people with knowledge of the move. Employees in Riccio\u2019s Vision Products Group, which includes a couple thousand engineers working on headsets and related technology, were told they would become the responsibility of John Ternus, Apple\u2019s hardware boss.\nMike Rockwell, Riccio\u2019s current lieutenant, will continue to lead the Vision Products Group on a day-to-day basis, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the changes aren\u2019t public. A spokesperson for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment.\nRiccio\u2019s exit marks one of the most significant departures from Apple\u2019s management team \u2014 though it\u2019s been in the making for some time. Three years ago, he switched from being a senior vice president to a vice president and left the 12-person executive team, a step toward his eventual retirement.\nRiccio spoke at an event at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday, telling students he is \u201cwinding down\u201d his career at Apple. He said he wants to get more involved at the engineering program named for him at the university, including by potentially teaching or developing curriculum material. He also spoke about the birth of the original iMac and said the iPhone X was the product he was most proud to create.\nThe executive spent 26 years at the company and was known at times for an abrasive style and controversial moves, but he also made key hires and encouraged acquisitions that resulted in major new products. His tenure included overseeing some of Apple\u2019s biggest bets, including development of the Vision Pro headset and the failed bid to make a car.\nSince stepping down from the top hardware engineering post in early 2021, Riccio has led the Vision Products Group, or VPG, which includes the Vision Pro work. He was one of the biggest advocates for the device and served as a bridge between the group and Apple\u2019s top executive team.\nTurning the Vision Pro into a hit has been an uphill fight for Apple. The headset, which melds augmented and virtual reality, was plagued by problems with weight, overheating and a high price. But it\u2019s still seen as a stepping stone toward more commercially successful devices.\nOther projects struggled to even get to the product stage. When Riccio ran Apple\u2019s hardware division, he led Apple\u2019s push into self-driving cars, an endeavor that was abandoned this year. An earlier attempt to make Apple television sets was shuttered nearly a decade ago.\nBut Apple also brought several major devices to market under Riccio\u2019s watch, including AirPods, the iPad Pro and the first large-screen iPhones. Riccio became Apple\u2019s hardware chief in 2012 upon the exit of Bob Mansfield. When Riccio left that job, he was replaced by Ternus.\nRiccio\u2019s transition to a smaller role in recent years fits a pattern for Apple. After Phil Schiller stepped down as head of marketing in 2020, he remained in charge of the App Store. And the company is trying a similar tack with Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri, who is leaving his job at the end of this year but staying on to oversee real estate and information security efforts.\nRiccio was a key player under Steve Jobs before Cook took over in 2011, and his departure represents one of the biggest changes since the 2019 exit of design guru Jony Ive. A larger shake-up still lies ahead. Many members of Apple\u2019s management team are nearing retirement age at the same time, including Cook, who turns 65 next year.\nBloomberg News reported in March that Riccio, who joined Apple in 1998 as a director in its product design group, was nearing retirement. Dan Rosckes, Apple\u2019s procurement chief, is also retiring imminently, Bloomberg reported this week.\nDuring his talk Wednesday, Riccio said he\u2019s been looking to retire for five years and that his last day would be Friday. He also discussed the leadership skills he learned working with Cook and his \u201cold boss Steve.\u201d Big tech companies fail because they grow risk-averse, Riccio said, with executives feeling like they have too much to lose.\nHe said Apple has thrived because it stayed nimble and empowered executives in a way that there was \u201cone throat to choke\u201d when something went wrong, rather than having multiple managers making excuses.\n--With assistance from Austin Carr.\n(Updates with more remarks from Riccio in second-to-last paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\nHow Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nInside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds\nJamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Stock In Buffett Stock Portfolio?",
        "Author": "  Ashar Jawad ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list titled Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the top 10 stocks in Buffet's portfolio.\nWarren Buffet is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index 2024, the Oracle of Omaha has a net worth of $143 billion, making him the ninth richest person in the world. His wealth would have been much more had he not decided to donate most of his vast fortune to charities. Since 2006, Buffet has donated over $55 billion to various charitable organizations, with a majority of the gifts going to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\nBuffet rose to prominence in 1965, after transitioning his investment firm into a conglomerate that held stakes in companies belonging to a broad range of industries. Between then and 2023, his firm earned average annual returns of\u00a019.8%, outperforming most stock indices that delivered returns around the 10 percent mark during this period. However, this year, Buffet seems to be in a defensive mode and is currently in the news for his sell-off spree, significantly reducing his investments in several notable companies.\nThere have been mixed opinions about Buffet hunkering down on stocks. Edward Jones analyst, Jim Shanahan, said that the actions make him \u2018concerned\u2019\u00a0about Buffet\u2019s outlook for the stock market and the American economy. In contrast, Daniel Ives, a Wedbush analyst, is less worried and believes that despite the selling spree, Berkshire still holds the top positions in those stocks by large margins, which should not be viewed as a \u2018smoke signal for bad news ahead\u2019.\nSo what will Warren Buffet do with all that cash? Andrew Bary, the associate editor at Barron\u2019s, recently stated that the billionaire has been on the look for a major acquisition for some while now, which has so far proven elusive. He believes the Berkshire CEO may just hold the cash for some while, earn interest on Treasury Bills, and wait for potential opportunities to grab in the stock market.\nAnother factor that has likely contributed to Warren Buffet dumping stake in some of his top stocks is the speculation around the increase in capital gains tax. The debate on the tax rate has been on for some time now and has even become a talking point in the run-up to the presidential elections. Vice President, Kamala Harris, during a speech in New Hampshire this month, proposed to raise the long-term capital gains tax for wealthy individuals to 28%.\nThe current tax rate is\u00a021%\u00a0when a gain is realized. Massive gains over the long term result in a large tax. Warren Buffet invested in stocks he is currently selling a long time ago, and hence, is sitting on handsome gains. The rationale behind selling these stocks could be to capitalize on the gains as much as possible on the current low tax rate, instead of paying hefty taxes later if the rate were to be increased.\nWe scanned Warren Buffet\u2019s portfolio, as of June 30, 2024, and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value. The figures were sourced from the\u00a0Insider Monkey Database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nStake Value as of Q2 2024: $84,248,000,000\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a cornerstone of Warren Buffet\u2019s portfolio for the last several years. However, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s recent filings revealed it had sold 389,368,450 Apple shares during the second quarter of 2024, representing nearly half of its stake in the iPhone maker.\nAnalysts believe that while there may be various potential reasons behind the sell-off, it is likely that Warren wanted to lock in gains at a lower tax rate, amid speculations of the capital gains being increased from 21% to 28%. Vltava Fund also believes the decision was influenced by taxation. Here is what the fund stated in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\nYou probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire\u2019s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett\u2019s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire\u2019s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\nDespite the downsizing, Apple remains the\u00a0top pick in the Buffet stock portfolio, with a holding value of over $84 billion, accounting for 30.09% of the portfolio. Moreover, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 184 hedge funds have investments in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as of Q2 2024, making it one of the\u00a0best stocks to buy now.\nThe recently concluded third quarter of FY24 was one of the best quarters for Apple in a long while, during which it reported a June quarter record revenue of $85.8 billion, representing a 5% year-over-year increase. Revenue from products grew 2% from last year, driven by the launch of iPad Pro and iPad Air, to reach $61.8 billion. Services revenue also reached an all-time high of $24.2 billion, registering a 14% spike from last year. Gross margin stood at 46.3%, which was within the higher range of the guidance. EPS was recorded at $1.40, beating analysts expectations of $1.35 per share.\nThe Cupertino-based tech giant reported $39.3 billion from iPhone sales in Q3, which accounted for nearly half of Apple\u2019s overall revenue for the quarter. The figure was down 1% year-over-year and is attributed to the 6.5% drop in sales in China, where the company faces fierce competition from local manufacturers like Huawei. While the dip in iPhone revenue has caused some investor concern, most remain bullish on the stock after the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the new iPhone 16.\nThere is consensus among Wall Street analysts on the stock\u2019s Buy rating with a share price upside potential of 8.58%.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st among the Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Is Selling Apple Stock and Buying This Magnificent Oil Stock Instead",
        "Author": "  Brett Schafer ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett finally did it. After making a monster investment in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) many years ago and watching it appreciate by multiples of his cost basis, the legendary investor is trimming Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.B) stake. According to filings with the SEC, Buffett has sold approximately half of Berkshire's stake in Apple, raising around $80 billion in cash. Yes, that's how big a winner Apple was for the company.\nWhat is he doing with all this cash? The largest stock purchase for Berkshire Hathaway in the second quarter was Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Here's why he is selling Apple and buying this oil stock instead.\nApple has made its investors a fortune over the last few decades. After releasing the revolutionary iPhone \u2014 perhaps the most successful single product in history \u2014 its stock has generated huge returns for shareholders. Total return in the last 10 years alone is close to 1,000%.\nWhile that is all fine and dandy, today the company is seeing stagnating revenue growth amid market saturation for smartphones. Revenue has essentially been flat over the last few years as fewer people have upgraded to new iPhones, which is the only true needle mover for the company. It has struggled to innovate and convince people to buy new phones while battling a consumer recession in China. Recent products such as the Apple Vision Pro look like flops so far, and the company has fallen behind in artificial intelligence to competitor Alphabet.\nStagnating sales are coupled with an expanded earnings multiple. Apple's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is now closing in on 35, which is wildly expensive for a low-growth business. Given Buffett's intense focus on valuation in his investment process, it is no surprise to see him unloading his shares in the iPhone maker. The upside doesn't look too appetizing at these levels.\nBuffett's biggest purchase last quarter was in Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire Hathaway owns a whopping 27.25% of Occidental's outstanding shares, making it the largest shareholder by far in the company.\nWhy is Buffett attracted to the stock? First and foremost is the valuation. Oil and gas companies have been neglected by investors for years as they focus on exciting technology companies. Occidental Petroleum trades at a P/E of 12.6, which is around one-third that of Apple. The company is one of the largest oil producers in the United States, with over 82% of its production coming from domestic sources. This makes it less risky than other oil companies that have to deal with adversarial foreign governments.\nOccidental can also play as a hedge for oil prices. Rising oil prices can be inflationary and affect other parts of the economy and the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. If oil prices rise, Occidental Petroleum will benefit, but likely hurt the earnings power of Berkshire's railroad subsidiary by increasing input costs. This way, Berkshire Hathaway is playing both sides of the situation. No matter what happens, it comes out on top.\nEven better for Buffett, Occidental trades at a cheap P/E when oil prices are falling. The current level for crude oil is $68 a barrel, which is well off the highs of around $100 a barrel or higher in 2022. If the price of oil starts to rise again, Occidental's earnings power will rise too.\nWith his selling of Apple and buying of Occidental Petroleum, Buffett is giving investors an important lesson in the risk-free rate and how it can affect your investing decisions.\nToday, Berkshire Hathaway has a cash pile approaching $300 billion sitting in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. These bills earn around 5% in yield every year and can be considered the risk-free rate for investors. Why? Because you can compare them to the earnings yield of other stocks in your portfolio.\nAn earnings yield is the inverse of the P/E and tells you how much in earnings you are yielding each year from a company, based on the current stock price. Apple's earnings are not growing, and it has a P/E of close to 35. Invert that P/E, and you have an earnings yield of 2.9%. Buffett is saying he would rather own Treasury bills than get a 2.9% yield owning Apple stock.\nBut what if we look at Occidental Petroleum's earnings yield? Take one divided by 12.6, and its earnings yield is 7.9%. That is much higher than the current Treasury yield. While it's not the entire story for any stock, comparing the earnings yield to the risk-free rate is a good way to gauge whether you should buy the stock. This likely came into consideration when Buffett was selling Apple and buying shares of Occidental Petroleum.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

Rosckes is being succeeded by David Tom, who has served as his top deputy the last several years, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the changes haven\u2019t been announced.\nRosckes, whose title is vice president of global sourcing and supply management, has been responsible for obtaining components and reaching agreements with suppliers. It\u2019s a vital role at a company known for driving a hard bargain with vendors \u2014 an approach that bolsters the profit margins of iPhones, iPads and other products.\nFor years, Rosckes ran Apple\u2019s procurement group alongside former executive Tony Blevins, who left in 2022. With that departure, Rosckes took sole charge of the organization, reporting to operations chief Sabih Khan. Tom, meanwhile, led procurement of silicon, wireless components and batteries. He joined Apple in 2003 to work on its legal team.\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the moves.\nAs a vice president, Rosckes is one of about 100 executives helping Apple\u2019s senior management team run the company on a daily basis. While not a household name, he has been a key player at Apple for two decades, helping ensure that products come out on time each year. The company purchases components in massive quantities, and its sourcing decisions can reshape the tech industry.\nIn 2022 and 2023, several Apple vice presidents left the company, but the rate of departures has slowed so far in 2024. Still, bigger changes are likely coming in the next few years, with many top executives nearing retirement age. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, for instance, turns 64 in November and has been with Apple for more than 25 years.\nIn August, Apple announced that Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri is stepping down from his role at the end of this year. The company said he will remain at Apple in a more limited position, overseeing information systems, corporate digital security and real estate efforts.\n(Updated with details about Apple CEO Tim Cook in penultimate paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\nMusk Reveals Why He\u2019s Jumping Into Trump\u2019s Arms\nWhy Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money?\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) -The U.S. National Labor Relations board accused Apple of interfering with workers' rights to collectively advocate for better working conditions by restricting their use of social media and workplace messaging app Slack, the agency said on Friday.\nThe NLRB complaint, issued on Thursday, accuses the iPhone maker of maintaining unlawful work rules around the acceptable uses of Slack, illegally firing an employee who advocated for workplace changes on Slack, requiring another worker to delete a social media post, and creating the impression that employees were being surveilled via social media.\nThis is the second time the NLRB has hit Apple with a complaint this month. Last week, the agency accused the company of requiring employees nationwide to sign illegal confidentiality, nondisclosure, and noncompete agreements and of imposing overly broad misconduct and social media policies.\nApple in a statement provided by a spokesperson on Friday said it is committed to maintaining \"a positive and inclusive workplace\" and takes employee complaints seriously.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with these claims and will continue to share the facts at the hearing,\" the company said.\nIn response to last week's complaint, Apple denied wrongdoing and said it respects its employees' rights to discuss wages, hours and working conditions.\nIf Apple does not settle with the NLRB, an administrative judge will hold an initial hearing in the case in February. The judge's decision can be reviewed by the five-member labor board, whose rulings can be appealed in federal court.\nThe new case stems from a complaint filed with the NLRB nearly three years ago by Janneke Parrish, who says Apple fired her in 2021 for playing a lead role in employee activism.\nParrish used Slack and public social media outlets to advocate for permanent remote work, distribute a pay equity survey, detail alleged sex and race discrimination at Apple and post open letters critical of the company, according to the new complaint.\nSlack, which allows workers to create group conversations, was rolled out several years ago at Apple and became increasingly popular as a discussion forum during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe NLRB complaint says Apple has a policy barring workers from creating new Slack channels without permission from managers. Posts about workplace concerns must be directed to a manager or a \"People Support\" group, according to the complaint.\nParrish's lawyer, Laurie Burgess, said in an email on Friday that Apple had engaged in \"extensive violations\" of workers' rights.\n\"We look forward to holding Apple accountable at trial for implementing facially unlawful rules and terminating employees for engaging in the core protected activity of calling out gender discrimination and other civil rights violations that permeated the workplace,\" Burgess said.\nThe complaint seeks an order requiring Apple to rescind its allegedly unlawful policies and reimburse Parrish for lost income and other financial impacts of her firing.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Richard Chang and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) notched a record high closing price as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company.\nShares rose 2.4% Monday to above $138. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. \nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings.\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201d\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chips has been \u201cinsane.\u201d\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

Additionally, the facility aims to potentially employ upwards of 1,000 domestic and international experts, solidifying its place as Apple's most extensive R&D center outside the U.S.\nAdditionally, Apple's expansion comes at a point where there is heightened competition in the Chinese region, with domestic smartphone makers such as Huawei continuing to gain ground over the Cupertino giant.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks to Watch.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the latest rebound in the market.\n\u201cNever get tired of all-time highs. We are experiencing a time for the market which is what I said would happen when the Fed starts cutting rates when the economy is still solid.\u201d\nCramer said that the key reason the market roared to highs was strong earnings from top banks. He said since the Fed\u2019s interest rate cuts have just started, investors believe maybe the \u201cbest is yet to come.\u201d\nJim Cramer wondered whether this strong performance trend would be a \u201cpattern\u201d in this earnings season.\n\u201cWe will find out soon enough. We will see if the positive action will be sustained.\u201d\nCramer recommended investors to \u201clisten to the calls\u201d this earning season and \u201cponder a moment, and only then should you pull the trigger.\u201d\n\u201cWe are at the beginning of one of the year\u2019s four reporting periods. Probably the most exciting. I can\u2019t believe I still get fired up, but man, am I ever.\u201d\nFor this article, we watched the latest episodes of Jim Cramer\u2019s \u2018Lightning Round\u2019 segment on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he was talking about. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nTalking about an analyst downgrade on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Jim Cramer acknowledged that iPhone maker is facing some \u201cnear-term\u201d headwinds but urged investors to buy the stock.\n\u201cWhen everyone knows there are real issues, though, you will have a limited window to buy the stock after the expected post-weakness.\u201d\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features. But the latest numbers for iPhone 16 do not show much enthusiasm for the new device.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cYou probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire\u2019s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett\u2019s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire\u2019s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Jim Cramer Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\u201cUnlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one\u2019s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there\u2019s just a lot of money going around.\u201d\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\u201cWe know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.\u201d\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\u201cWhy stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.\u201d\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nCramer discussed insights from JPMorgan and Evercore regarding why investors should consider buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, arguing that negativity surrounding the company might be overblown ahead of its earnings report.\n\u201cToday, two firms, JPMorgan and Evercore, talked about why you need to buy Apple. Both pieces stress that maybe people have gotten too bearish on the stock ahead of the earnings. So we might need to rethink all that negativity and just buy the darn thing. I mean, it's bizarre that so many people are so eager to hate the stock of one of the greatest companies in history, especially when the stock's been such a great long-term performer. Quizzical, isn't it?\nCramer noted that the analysts from JPMorgan and Evercore are taking a more optimistic stance. He also emphasized the importance of owning the stock for the long term rather than trading it.\n\u201cSo many analysts have now shaded down their estimates for Apple that, get this, if business is simply okay, the estimates will prove to be too low. So these two bold analysts at JP Morgan [and] Evercore wanted to take the other side of the trade, the positive side. Plus, many of the objections to Apple may not hold as much water as they did even a couple [of] weeks ago. For example, we know a lot of people were worried about Chinese demand, but get this, if the Chinese government's actually able to stimulate, right, the stimulus plan starts working well, don't you think that China's issues are a smaller concern, more money for consumers in China means more orders for the prestigious iPhone.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), known primarily for its iconic iPhone, remains one of the most reputable companies in history and is on the brink of a significant upgrade cycle driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. In September, the company introduced a suite of AI-powered features branded as Apple Intelligence. The new offering aims to advance the functionality of the latest iPhones, iPads, and Macs, providing users with tools that facilitate quick writing and summarizing of texts and emails, photo editing, and the creation of personalized images.\nWhile the new features were not ready for public release at the launch of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro last month, anticipation is building for the upcoming iOS 18.1, which is expected to be available on October 28. The latest operating system will integrate Apple Intelligence, further expanding the capabilities of Apple devices and promising to improve the user experience significantly.\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%.

Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations.

However, Piper noted upgrade expectations were up from the 20% level in its Spring 2024 survey. In addition, only about 30% of teens were upgrading any of their Apple hardware in the next six months due to Apple Intelligence, which to the firm felt low given the enthusiasm.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. The one-month return of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was 2.04%, and its shares gained 25.93% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 4, 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $226.80 per share with a market capitalization of $3.422 trillion.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"You probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire\u2019s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett\u2019s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire\u2019s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\"\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nApple Inc.

Jobs did this for many years before switching over to the Mercedes-Benz SL55.\nAccording to the report, Jobs did this because he hated license plates.\nAt one point, the state of California did not require new vehicles to have a license plate for up to six months.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia has asked Alphabet's Google and Apple to block Chinese fast fashion e-commerce firm Temu in their application stores in the country so it cannot be downloaded, a minister said on Friday.\nThe move was intended to pre-emptively protect the country's small and medium-sized businesses against cheap products being offered by PDD Holdings' Temu, communications minister Budi Arie Setiadi told Reuters, even though authorities have not found any transactions yet by its residents on the platform.\nTemu's rapid growth has triggered scrutiny over its low-cost business model of sending parcels to customers from China by several countries.\nTemu's business model, which connects consumers directly with factories in China in order to significantly reduce prices, is \"unhealthy competition,\" Budi said.\n\"We're not here to protect e-commerce, but we protect small and medium enterprises. There are millions we must protect,\" the minister said.\nJakarta will also block any investment by Temu in local e-commerce if it makes such a move, Budi said, adding he has not heard of any such plan.\nBudi also said the government plans to request a similar block for Chinese shopping service Shein.\nTemu, Apple and Google did not respond to requests to comment.\nShein said they do not have operations in Indonesia, a company spokeperson said.\nIndonesia forced China's ByteDance social media platform TikTok to close its e-commerce service in the country last year to protect local merchants and users' data.\nMonths later, TikTok agreed to buy a majority stake in Indonesian tech conglomerate GoTo's e-commerce unit in order to stay in Southeast Asia's biggest e-commerce market.\nOn Tuesday, Indonesian homegrown e-commerce Bukalapak.com denied reports about an acquisition plan by Temu.\nIndonesia's e-commerce industry is set to expand to about $160 billion by 2030 from $62 billion in 2023, according to a report by Google, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and consultancy Bain & Co.\n(Reporting by Ananda Teresia; Editing by Kim Coghill and Michael Perry)\n"

Apple contributed engineering expertise, specifically in areas like heat management and advanced battery packs, while BYD supplied its manufacturing resources and proprietary LFP technologies.\nThe battery was intended to be safer than most EV batteries at the time, per Bloomberg, and longer range.\nApple canned its plans for a car back in February after reportedly spending roughly $1 billion a year on the project since 2014. While it ultimately didn't come to fruition, the effort wasn't a total failure; according to Bloomberg, battery insights gleaned from the car project helped other Apple teams with the development of the Vision Pro and Neural Engine chip.\n"

        "Author": "  Syeda Seirut Javed ",
        "Text": "We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer on Netflix and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer.\nRecently, Mad Money\u2019s host, Jim Cramer addressed what he called a \u201cridiculous plethora of sell-side downgrades,\u201d noting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.94%, the S&P 500 decreased by 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.18% on Monday. While he acknowledged the session\u2019s poor performance, he cautioned that paying too much attention to downgrades can be detrimental for long-term investors.\nCramer urged investors not to get overly influenced by the negative sentiment on Wall Street and emphasized the importance of staying committed to strong companies, even when their stock prices experience volatility. He recounted the history of the bull market, stating:\n\u201cWhen I look at the history of this incredible bull market, and it has been an incredible bull market, it\u2019s littered with buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell, buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell. These downgrades scare you out of amazing stocks at levels that may temporarily be too high, but will recover later. If you listen to the downgrades, though, you\u2019ll never recover with it.\u201d\nIn discussing the challenges investors face, Cramer pointed out that many get rattled by analyst downgrades and might sell their shares in solid companies, which can make it difficult to buy back in later.\n\u201cIn the last decade, the toughest thing to do is to hold on to good stocks. But analysts and commentators love to take aim at big long-term winners. Their jeremiads have scared so many people out of some amazing gains.\u201d\nHe observed that complacency can be prevalent on Wall Street, with bullish investors often overlooking risks while bearish ones miss out on potential opportunities. For those considering action based on a downgrade, Cramer advised waiting for a bounce to sell, but he noted that timing such moves is \u201cincredibly hard,\u201d even for seasoned traders.\nCramer emphasized that when analysts downgrade stocks that have already taken a hit and overlook positive aspects, it can create a challenging environment. However, he believes it is still possible to profit. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u201cI need you to understand that when analysts downgrade after stocks have already been hammered, when really good investors ignore the positives, then, it may be a grim time. But not so grim that we can\u2019t make money by focusing on the fundamentals of the companies. And not just the economy, the Fed, interest rates and oil.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 7 and October 8. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCramer On Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): \u2018Own It\u2019\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a prominent designer and marketer of a diverse range of consumer electronics, including smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and wearables. Cramer discussed Jefferies\u2019 recent downgrade of the stock, which included a mixed assessment.\nHe discussed that while the analysts expressed a long-term positive view of the company\u2019s unique ability to integrate hardware and software for affordable AI services, they also highlighted that the smartphone hardware needs significant updates for advanced AI, potentially delaying progress until 2026 or 2027. Talking about the analysts\u2019 report, he said:\n\u201cListen to this: \u2018We like Apple Intelligence long term as Apple is the only hardware-software integrated player that can leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services.\u2019\nCramer also noted potential benefits from the Chinese government\u2019s economic measures, given the company\u2019s exposure to that market. He mentioned strong sales reported by T-Mobile and said:\n\u201cOh, and by the way, let\u2019s remember [the] Chinese government finally training the bazooka on their flailing economy. It looks like their consumers will get some free money. That\u2019s huge because Apple\u2019s got a ton of exposure to China\u2026 With all the talk about the iPhone 16 disappointing, does it matter that T Mobile, one of the biggest sellers of the thing, told me personally that sales are good? I think it should matter\u2026 I say own it. Don\u2019t trade it too hard.\u201d\nIn 2023, the iPhone achieved a significant milestone by becoming the leading smartphone in the market, surpassing Samsung for the first time, according to IDC. Despite this achievement, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) still held only 20% of all smartphone shipments last year, which points to considerable room for further growth. The introduction of new AI services and features could substantially increase the iPhone\u2019s appeal and solidify its position in the competitive smartphone market.\nThe company has shown strong profitability, generating $101 billion in profit from $385 billion in revenue over the past year. In the latest quarter, service sales grew by 14.1%, reaching $24.2 billion, with this category enjoying a much higher gross margin of 74% compared to the 35.3% margin for products.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\u201d\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be the world's largest company, with a $3.4 trillion market cap, but that doesn't mean it will retain that place forever. Some cracks in Apple's armor could make it vulnerable, allowing other companies to pass Apple in market cap.\nHere are three stocks that could be worth more than Apple five years from now.\nApple isn't the company it used to be. It used to be at the forefront of innovation and consistently released game-changing products. It hasn't done that for some time, and even the latest iPhone (iPhone 16) seems to be struggling despite its much-hyped Apple Intelligence features.\nAll of this adds up to a business that hasn't grown its sales since 2022.\nDespite that, Apple's stock fetches a premium valuation, trading for 30.5 times forward earnings.\nThat's a premium price tag for a company that hasn't grown at all, leaving it susceptible to other stocks surpassing it. If it doesn't show growth soon, the premium will not be maintained.\nPlenty of other stocks could surpass Apple if this happens, and all of them are likely better investments right now.\nFive years from now, the three companies that I think can pass Apple are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). These three are obvious choices, as they round out the rest of the top four largest companies in the world.\nUnderstanding why these three could surpass Apple is key, as they all have different reasons.\nStarting with the second-largest company, Nvidia, it is nipping at Apple's heels. It's only 5% away from dethroning Apple, and with the massive demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used for artificial intelligence (AI) model creation, it's nearly a surefire bet to be larger than Apple.\nDespite its incredible growth this year, Wall Street still expects 42% revenue growth for fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026). That far exceeds anything Apple will put up, but Nvidia trades for 47 times forward earnings -- a far greater price tag than investors are paying for Apple.\nIt will take some time for this premium to come down, but I think it's possible over the course of five years.\nMicrosoft is next in line, only 11% away from the top spot. Microsoft has been a stalwart, growing revenue by more than 15% over the past year. It also rides on the back of AI, with its cloud computing division, Azure, leading the way for the company. It trades for 31.5 times forward earnings, nearly identical to Apple's price tag.\nHowever, Microsoft actually has the growth to support this valuation. So, as the market comes to its senses with Apple stock, don't be surprised to see Microsoft pass Apple in market cap.\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft could easily surpass Apple in the next few years, Alphabet's chances are slightly lower.\nAlphabet's case rests on its premium increase and Apple's decrease. Alphabet's revenue growth has been in the low teens for the past year, which places it far above Apple.\nHowever, Alphabet doesn't fetch the premium Apple does and trades for 21.5 times forward earnings. That's cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23.5 times forward earnings.\nIf Alphabet were to fetch the same premium as Apple (30.5 times forward earnings), it would have 42% upside. That would give it a $2.88 trillion market cap, only 19% away from Apple. If Alphabet continues its pattern of growth and Apple continues its pattern of stagnation, that would be an easy gap to close over five years, allowing Alphabet to surpass Apple.\nAdditionally, Apple's premium could decrease to the market average, which would provide a similar effect to Alphabet's rise.\nI think there is a strong chance Apple is worth less than these three if it doesn't start growing sales soon. If it launches a new product that's a hit, then these projections likely won't hold true.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 797% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 170% for the S&P 500.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

To date, the company has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in technology, tools, and resources to more than 200 education and community partners. In the last year alone, Apple has expanded its support to nearly 40 new education partners across Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nThis work is largely connected to Apple\u2019s Community Education Initiative, through which the company provides hardware, scholarships, financial support, educator resources, and access to Apple experts to schools and organizations in under-resourced communities. Apple collaborates with each partner organization to customize and enhance programming to support the community\u2019s specific goals and transform students\u2019 in-school and extracurricular experiences.\nApple\u2019s extensive education initiatives also include Apple Developer Academies and the Apple Foundation Program, which bring coding education and skills training to developers and entrepreneurs around the world, along with free resources like Everyone Can Code\u00ae, Develop in Swift Tutorials, Everyone Can Create, Challenge for Change, and Today at Apple\u00ae sessions at all Apple Store\u00ae locations.\nAs detailed in the newly released Education Impact Report, in the past five years, more than 10,000 teachers have received professional learning opportunities through Apple grants. Over that same time frame, 500,000 students in close to 2,000 schools and communities around the world have engaged in the company\u2019s grant programs. Apple currently supports more than 200 schools and nonprofit organizations \u2014 a number that continues to increase.\nForging New Partnerships and Deepening Existing Work\nCodeDoor, one of Apple\u2019s newer partners, provides coding and workforce preparedness training for migrants throughout Germany. Apple supports the organization\u2019s Creators program, which uses Everyone Can Code resources and Swift Playgrounds\u00ae to give participants the tools to design and pitch apps as solutions to community challenges. Through a hybrid experience that takes place over the course of eight months, participants acquire valuable skills, including coding with Swift\u00ae and presentation techniques.\n\"CodeDoor was created from the idea that young people are curious and approach learning as a process of discovery, but need the right tools to feel empowered,\" said Karan Dehghani, CodeDoor\u2019s founder. \"With support from Apple, our Creators program teaches learners from migrant families how to identify and solve real-life problems through app development \u2014 equipping a new generation of Germans with the skills they need to build community and a brighter future.\"\nApple is also deepening its work with existing community partners. Since 2020, the company has collaborated with the New York Public Library to expand access to technology through in-person and virtual training classes for learners of all ages and skill levels, with a focus on helping adults develop confidence in their computer skills and grow more comfortable in today\u2019s digital world.\n\"The world is evolving so fast. One of the ways that we can help shape and ensure the future of libraries is to create spaces that are designed for collaborative, interactive learning,\" said Brandy McNeil, Ph.D., the New York Public Library\u2019s deputy director of Branch Programs & Services. \"With the tools and resources only Apple can provide, we\u2019ve been able to expand both our programming and our reach to better serve our community, helping many more people harness the power of technology to learn and grow.\"\nCelebrating World Teachers\u2019 Day Across Apple\nIn honor of World Teachers\u2019 Day, Apple is celebrating educators around the world through special collections and offerings across its services.\nThe Great Tools for Teachers collection in the App Store\u00ae highlights classroom and lesson-planning essentials that educators can use to support their work. On Apple Music\u00ae, users can listen to a collection of learning-based albums and playlists highlighted throughout the Kids and Family categories; on Apple Books\u00ae, readers can explore a collection of nonfiction and kids\u2019 books about inspiring educators; and in Podcasts, listeners can find featured shows focusing on conversations by and for educators alongside narratives about education. Additionally, the Apple TV\u00ae app features a collection of movies and shows that highlight the importance of teachers in the lives of pupils.\nAcross the world, teachers can use Group Reservations to book a Today at Apple session for their students at their local Apple Store, selecting from more than 20 topics great for educators and their students to learn how to code, create, and get the most out of Apple products. Learn more and request a session at apple.com/today/groups.\nAdditionally, Apple is hosting a special session for teachers at Apple Park Visitor Center in Cupertino, California, on World Teachers\u2019 Day (October 5). The Go Further with iPadOS 18 for Education workshop will bring together certified Apple Learning Coaches and educators from across California for hands-on demos using iPad Pro\u00ae and Apple Pencil Pro\u2122.\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple\u2019s six software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+.

        "Title": "Apple\u2019s hearing aid software could change how we deal with hearing loss forever",
        "Author": "  Robert Barrie ",
        "Text": "\u201cPrevention,\u201d; \u201cawareness\u201d; \u201cassistance\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s what Apple described as the three key tenets behind implementing hearing aid capabilities into its best-selling earphones.\nApple revealed an entry into the hearing loss space during a keynote presentation in September, unveiling software that will transform its Airpods into hearing aids for patients with mild forms of auditory impairment.\nJust a few days after the presentation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Apple\u2019s over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid software \u2013 which the agency described as the first of its kind. The software, which is expected to roll out to compatible devices in late 2024 has been hailed as a gamechanger by many - but will it introduce a new paradigm to hearing impairment?\nCardiovascular parameters; medication management; sleep apnoea \u2013 Apple\u2019s suite of medical capabilities is growing at great speed. Addressing hearing loss \u2013 which affects more than 30 million people in America to some degree \u2013 is the latest string the US technology giant is adding to its healthcare bow.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to provide breakthrough software features with AirPods Pro that put users\u2019 hearing health front and center, bringing new ways to help test for and receive assistance for hearing loss,\u201d Apple\u2019s vice president of health Sumbul Desai said in a statement.\nWhat separates Apple from many others designing hearing aids is that its therapeutic framework lies in software, as opposed to a dedicated device. Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro 2 are used for listening to music and podcasts normally, but when coupled with the software \u2013 called Hearing Aid Feature \u2013 they transform into a hearing aid. The FDA says it is intended to amplify sounds for those aged 18 years and over with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment.\nThe FDA based its decision on data from a trial involving 118 participants with this type of hearing loss. Results showed that patients who used the software received similar benefits to those using traditional devices.\nThe trial\u2019s principal investigator Rick Neitzel said in a statement: \u201cThese tools will help people protect their ears from noise pollution, be aware of changes in their hearing over time, and have important conversations with their healthcare providers when they need additional support.\u201d\nThe FDA stated the authorisation \u201cexemplifies [its] continued commitment to provide safe and effective solutions for those with hearing loss.\u201d The approval follows on from OTC hearing aid regulations established in October 2022 that opened regulatory avenues for mild to moderate hearing impairment technologies that do not require an audiologist appointment or a medical exam.\nThe FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health acting director Michelle Tarver said the approval \u201cadvances the availability, accessibility and acceptability of hearing support\u201d.\nApple is by no means the only company to harness this regulation, though it is the first to use it for approval solely of software. Companies such as Jabra, Audien, and Eargo are popular options in the US \u2013 all FDA-approved as OTC devices. Sony has also developed its own device, a self-fitting hearing aid with a companion app on Apple and Android.\nApple\u2019s unique selling point, though, is that its software can be loaded into its AirPod Pro headphones \u2013 an already well-established wearable with wide-reaching market penetration. Apple's AirPod revenues in 2024 are estimated to generate around $22bn, according to Bloomberg.\nGlobalData analyst Shabnam Pervez says Apple's wealth of resources and market dominance will play a key role in potential swing in preference of devices from patients, along with resisting challenges posed by smaller companies.\n\u201cApple has a strong brand image and a loyal customer base, which can make it difficult for competitors to gain market share,\u201d Pervez explains.\nApple has the biggest smartphone market share in the US, and its headphone products also occupy large segments in the wearables sector. Implementing hearing aid capabilities into an already established and easily visible device will transform how hearing loss is treated, according to Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA).\n\u201cWhen a company like Apple comes out with this technology, it\u2019s in the mainstream. It gets people thinking about hearing loss. Maybe people aren\u2019t ready to wear a hearing aid seven days a week, eight hours a day, but they\u2019re already wearing AirPods. This reduces stigma because everybody's got devices in their ears nowadays.\u201d\nAirPods Pro 2 are currently listed on Apple\u2019s website at $249. Whilst this does not take into account the added expense of the iPhone itself that is needed for the earbuds to function, it is still a lot cheaper than Sony\u2019s hearing aids, which sets users back around $1300. However, compared to other OTC hearing aids, Apple\u2019s technology still arguably represents a premium option.\nPervez says: \u201cApple's tech products are generally priced higher than competitors in the same market segment. However, it's important to note that Apple's products often hold their value well over time, and many consumers are willing to pay a premium for the perceived benefit of owning an Apple device.\u201d\nThe FDA has approved Apple\u2019s hearing aid software \u2013 which will be a free update to operating systems \u2013 for mild to moderate hearing loss, so it cannot be compared to prescription hearing aids. These devices are fitted and maintained by a healthcare professional for patients with significant hearing loss. Prescription hearing aids are more expensive because of their greater auditory capabilities \u2013 with an average cost of around $2500.\nWhilst Pervez asserts that the AirPods Pro 2 are not a replacement for traditional hearing aids, she says \u201cthey do offer a valuable and accessible option for many people with slight hearing loss.\u201d\nOne of the biggest challenges to Apple\u2019s launch in the hearing loss market is the lack of penetration in the older population. A 2023 report by AARP shows that 28% of adults aged 50 and over own a wearable device. This does not consider the digital skills needed to conduct the hearing test feature included in Apple\u2019s software. And whilst smartphone ownership is higher amongst this age group, it is still not uniformly high.\nThis could \u201ccreate a hurdle and narrow the market opportunity as this limits the potential user base to individuals who already own an iPhone or are willing to purchase one,\u201d according to Pervez.\nFor those who are invested in a different smartphone ecosystem, switching to an iPhone solely for the AirPods Pro 2 can be a \u201csignificant barrier,\u201d she adds.\nData shows that most individuals with hearing loss in this age group, however, fall under the more severe form of hearing impairment. Thus, Apple\u2019s target market \u2013 those with moderate hearing loss \u2013 is usually younger, where the company\u2019s devices are widespread.\nApple\u2019s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives, Sarah Herrlinger said the new features would \u201cmake an impact on so many people by driving more awareness around hearing health and empowering individuals with new customisable tools.\u201d\nAnd whilst Apple battles antitrust legal cases in the US centred around smartphone monopolisation, Kelley says ultimately the company\u2019s entry into the hearing loss device arena is \u201cexciting.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of people with hearing loss are going to progress and end up in the good care of audiologists, with a prescription hearing aid. But if people take a step to treatment sooner rather than later, that\u2019s important.\u201d\nFor the future, Kelley says she hopes to see \u201can explosion of technology where people have a lot of choices.\u201d Whether all those choices will come from Apple market domination remains to be seen.\n\"Apple\u2019s hearing aid software could change how we deal with hearing loss forever\" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  GlobalData ",
        "Text": "Apple collaborated with Chinese carmaker BYD for years on its now-cancelled car project, developing long-range EV batteries that laid the groundwork for current technology, reported Bloomberg.\nThe partnership began around 2017. It focused on creating a battery using lithium iron phosphate cells, aiming for greater range and safety compared to existing EV batteries, people familiar with the development told the publication.\nThe Apple BYD EV battery collaboration aimed to combine Apple's expertise in advanced battery packs and heat management with BYD's manufacturing knowledge and advancements in lithium iron phosphate cell technology.\nAlthough Apple does not own any technology used in BYD's current Blade batteries, the partnership's influence is evident in BYD's lineup, which now features the Blade system, the report said.\nThe partnership between Apple and BYD started when Apple was exploring core technologies for its vehicle project. BYD's Blade battery, known for its safety and energy storage capabilities, caught the attention of Apple executives.\nApple's goal was to customise the technology to boost the range of its planned EV, the undisclosed sources told Bloomberg.\nApple had invested approximately $1bn a year on its vehicle project, often considered one of the company's potential breakthroughs.\nDespite the project's cancellation in February, the collaboration with BYD had involved significant investments in battery design and engineering, with the aim of maximising cell capacity within the battery pack.\nThe collaboration was led by Apple's Alexander Hitzinger, a former executive at Volkswagen and Porsche, and Mujeeb Ijaz, a former A123 Systems employee.\nAt BYD, vice-president of the battery business Michael He was the counterpart.\nThe joint effort sought to create a safe, long-range battery system for Apple's vehicle.\nBYD's Blade battery has become a key selling point for the company, contributing to its sales of three million electric and hybrid vehicles in 2023.\nBYD has surpassed Tesla as the top EV seller globally, with its founder and chairman Wang Chuanfu becoming a billionaire.\nDespite the collaboration's initial promise, Apple distanced itself from the partnership, exploring other battery systems and facing numerous delays in its car project.\nThe EV business's challenging economics led to the project's termination.\nHowever, the endeavour provided valuable insights for other Apple products, including the Vision Pro headset and the Neural Engine AI processor.\nRepresentatives from both Apple and BYD declined to comment on the battery collaboration.\nBYD, however, stated that the Blade battery concept and development were solely the work of BYD engineers, with the company holding all property and patent rights.\n\"Apple reportedly partnered with China\u2019s BYD to develop long-range EV battery\" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other widely held stocks.\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D\u2019Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company behind the iPhone, is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. The launch of iPhone 16 and iOS 18 is expected to drive strong financial results for the company for the rest of 2024.\nIn FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple\u2019s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 10% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple\u2019s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn\u2019t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\"\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Probably Missed.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has claimed that Apple is poised to unveil a new version of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset next year. In a blog post, the analyst noted that the new product would go into mass production in the second-half of 2025 and will be powered by the M5 chip, as the tech giant aims to create a better Apple Intelligence user experience on the device. Per the analyst, if Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) integrates advanced AI models like Sora by OpenAI into the Vision Pro, the impact of text-to-video AI models on the head-mounted display device experience will likely be more impressive than on existing mainstream consumer electronics.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia closed at their highest ever on Monday, putting the heavyweight AI chipmaker on the brink of dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company.\nWith investors betting on strong demand for its current and next-generation AI processors, the Santa Clara, California company's stock climbed 2.4% to end the day at $138.07.\nIn June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company. It was overtaken by Microsoft, and the tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months.\nThe latest gains lifted Nvidia's market value to $3.39 trillion, just below Apple's $3.52 trillion value and above Microsoft's $3.12 trillion.\nNvidia has been Wall Street's biggest winner from a race between Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and other major tech companies to dominate emerging AI technology.\n\"We believe the major companies in AI ... face an investment environment characterized by a Prisoner's Dilemma \u2014 each is individually incentivized to continue spending, as the costs of not doing so are (potentially) devastating,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a report on Sunday.\nTD Cowen reiterated its $165 price target for Nvidia, which it called its \"Top Pick\", and it said demand for the company's current generation of AI chips remained strong.\nNvidia in August confirmed reports that a ramp-up in production of its upcoming Blackwell chips was delayed until the fourth quarter, but downplayed the impact, saying customers were snapping up existing chips.\nAs investors gear up for quarterly reporting season, Apple rose almost 2% and Microsoft added 0.7%, helping propel the S&P 500 up 0.8% to its own record high close.\nNvidia, Apple and Microsoft account for about a fifth of the S&P 500's weight, giving them a hefty influence in the index's day-to-day gains and losses.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the contract manufacturer that produces Nvidia's processors, is expected to report a 40% leap in quarterly profit on Thursday, thanks to soaring demand.\nAnalysts expect spending to build out AI data centers will help Nvidia's annual revenue more than double to nearly $126 billion, according to LSEG data.\nWhile Nvidia's rally has lifted the S&P 500 to record highs, investors worry optimism about AI could evaporate if signs emerge of a slowdown in spending on the technology.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by David Gregorio)\n"

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0regularly shares his investing wisdom on his YouTube channel, sharing market insights and lessons he\u2019s learned over the decades. Commenting about the Fed\u2019s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\u201cThe fact is, and I\u2019ve said this for a long time, I won\u2019t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.\u201d\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\u201cIf you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we\u2019re in now, in 2024.\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nbrandon-romanchuk-NOFyRmSQfUQ-unsplash\nBillionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Stake: $12,111,286,431\nInitial numbers on Apple\u2019s new iPhone are not encouraging. Shipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n\u201cWait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,\u201d said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. \u201cOn average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.\u201d\nIn the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they\u2019re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\nHowever, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn\u2019t great for Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We\u2019ll find out soon.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc.

        "Author": "  Debby Wu ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese police have taken into custody four Taiwanese employees at Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Apple Inc.\u2019s main assembly partner, the latest in a spate of detentions that have rattled investor confidence in the country.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought\nDubai\u2019s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City\u2019s Infrastructure\nInside the \u2018Utopias\u2019 of Mexico City\nThe Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan\u2019s Capital Is No Longer Working\nWhat It Takes to Make City Solutions Go Viral\nPolice in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou detained the quartet on charges of breach of trust, according to a statement from Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council on Wednesday. Zhengzhou is where Hon Hai, the flagship company of Foxconn Technology Group, operates the world\u2019s largest iPhone assembly plant.\nThe four employees are all Taiwanese, according to Elsie Tsai, spokeswoman for Taiwan\u2019s semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation, which provides administrative support for Taiwanese with their affairs in China.\nThe employees have not damaged Hon Hai\u2019s interest in any way, the council said in the statement, citing its understanding from the company. The incident could have been a result of some local police officers abusing their power, according to the council.\nLocal media in Taiwan reported that the four Hon Hai employees were detained earlier this year.\nA Foxconn representative did not have immediate comment on Thursday, which is a holiday in Taiwan. China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office also did not immediately respond to a faxed inquiry.\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly triggered the move. Foxconn\u2019s iPhone plant in Zhengzhou \u2014 called \u201ciPhone City\u201d because it cranks out the majority of Apple\u2019s marquee devices \u2014 is considered one of the country\u2019s signature manufacturing projects. It employs hundreds of thousands and delivers a major boost to the economy of the land-locked province of Henan.\nLast year, Chinese regulators conducted tax audits and reviewed land use by Foxconn when company founder Terry Gou was bidding to become the leader of democratic, self-ruling Taiwan, which China sees part of its territory. Later in 2023, Chinese tax authorities handed out a 20,000 yuan ($2,800) fine to a Foxconn subsidiary for overstating expenses. It is still unclear whether Chinese regulators have completed their probe into Foxconn.\nBeijing has taken aggressive actions against the staff of foreign firms in recent years as tensions with the US and its allies mount, spurring concerns about the safety of employees at multinational firms.\nAn executive at Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc. was indicted for espionage in August.\nBefore that, Beijing fined US-based Mintz Group about $1.5 million for illegal data collection, months after officials raided its offices and detained five of its Chinese employees.\nMore similar incidents took place in 2023. American consultancy Bain & Co. said Chinese authorities questioned staff at its Shanghai office, and security officials publicized a raid at Capvision, a consulting firm with headquarters in New York and Shanghai, accusing the company of abetting espionage efforts by foreign forces.\nAuthorities also detained an executive and two former employees of WPP Plc, one of the world\u2019s biggest advertising companies.\n--With assistance from Jing Li.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\nHow Starbucks\u2019 Colorful, Sugary Drinks Turned Kids Into Customers for Life\nWhen a Miracle Cure Is Left on the Shelf\nHow Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

The operating margin grew to 47.5% from 41.7% a year ago. It expects fourth-quarter revenue of $26.1 billion-$26.9 billion, above the Street consensus of $24.86 billion.\nNeedham analyst Charles Shi reiterated Taiwan Semiconductor with a Buy and a\u00a0$210\u00a0price target.\nNeedham: By node, relative to Shi\u2019s estimates, Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s third-quarter print shows a much more robust performance of 3nm and a slightly weaker performance of 5nm.\nThe analyst noted the 3nm upside should be primarily due to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In contrast, 5nm revenue is leveling off after six consecutive quarters of strong sequential growth.\nThe gross margin performance, which is now back in the high 50s range, is a positive sign as Taiwan Semiconductor overcomes several cost challenges anticipated by management earlier this year, including 3nm dilution, 5nm to 3nm conversion cost, and electricity cost increases, he said.\nInterestingly, the company had flagged 5nm and 3nm wafer prebuild as part of the reason for the gross margin upside, Shi added.\nThe analyst noted that Taiwan Semiconductor raised its full-year revenue growth target from \u201cslightly above the mid-20s\u201d to \u201cclose to 30%\u201d while maintaining the 10% ex-memory semiconductor growth outlook.\nTaiwan Semiconductor expects to triple AI revenue this year, which will account for mid-teens percent of its total revenue.\nBased on management commentary, Shi estimates Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s AI revenue was around $4 billion in 2023 and will likely reach $13 billion in 2024.\nTaiwan Semiconductor has guided AI to account for 20% of the total revenue by 2028, translating to ~$33 billion+ if the 15%+ total revenue CAGR continues through the next four years.\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s reported revenue split between technology nodes suggests that the non-wafer revenue, the majority of which comes from packaging, saw a meaningful step up from $2.4 billion in the second quarter to $3.2 billion in the third quarter, a 36% increase sequentially.\nThis could be partially driven by Apple\u2019s ramp that drives InFO revenue. Still, the magnitude of the sequential growth is above seasonality (~20% sequentially) and supports the rumor that Taiwan Semiconductor may have released 60%-80% more CoWoS capacity in the third quarter.\nTaiwan Semiconductor expects 2024\u2019s CapEx to be slightly above $30 billion, a $1 billion trim to 2024\u2019s CapEx budget. Last quarter, it tightened the CapEx guidance range from $28 billion-$32 billion to $30 billion-$32 billion and effectively raised CapEx by about $1 billion.\nOn the bright side, with Taiwan Semiconductor reporting the quarterly CapEx for the first three quarters of the year to be only $6 billion per quarter, it needs to spend ~$12 billion CapEx in the fourth quarter. The magnitude of the step-up is likely driven by the initial 2nm buildout.\nPrice Action: TSM stock is up 11.7% at $209.41 at last check Thursday.\nAlso Read:\nCitigroup Remains A Compelling Investment Opportunity: Analysts Take On Q3 Performance\nPhoto by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nJan 2022\nAtlantic Equities\nUpgrades\nNeutral\nOverweight\nOct 2021\nCowen & Co.\nInitiates Coverage On\nMarket Perform\nJul 2021\nNeedham\nInitiates Coverage On\nBuy\nView More Analyst Ratings for TSM\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "Title": "iPhone 16 Surge vs. Valuation Woes: Can Apple Maintain Its Bullish Run?",
        "Author": "  muslimfarooque ",
        "Text": "Cupertino-based tech giant Apple has been on a superb six-month surge, rebounding sharply from its April lows with impressive momentum. Since April, it has been a sea of green for Apple investors, pocketing more than 30% in gains over the past six months. Moreover, with the iPhone upgrade super cycle underway and despite the concerns, the iPhone 16 is proving to be a strong seller, with analysts optimistic about Apple stock's performance. However, after its powerful surge in value, the stock trades at a sizeable premium, outpacing its historical benchmarks and peers. Nonetheless, with the upcoming Apple intelligence rollout for the iPhone 16 and strong October-November seasonality, I expect the stock to continue moving higher despite the risks.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SHOP.\nApple has been building a healthy head of steam leading up to the recent iPhone 16 launch, fueled by bullish calls from analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives. Ives touted an upgrade supercycle driven by the release of AI-powered features for the company's flagship iPhone device earlier this year. Following the highly anticipated OpenAI partnership revealed at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, Ives called it a home run.\nMoreover, he talked about the pervasive impact of the AI-driven super cycle that'll likely extend beyond iPhones and into their services. Ives felt Apple didn't receive enough credit for its AI monetization, a scenario likely to change with 1.5 billion iPhones primed to upgrade.\nRoughly three months have passed since the WWDC event, and the iPhone 16 is in stores, boasting an impressive opening weekend. Ives wrote in a recent investor note that iPhone 16 sales are likely to rise by high single digits, potentially reaching double digits by the fourth-quarter. Moreover, he added that the iPhone 16's AI features, camera upgrades, and improved battery life could drive its upgrade cycle to exceed 90 million units at launch, ahead of its predecessor, the iPhone 15, by 8 million to 10 million units. Following the encouraging launch numbers, Ives maintains his Outperform rating on the stock, assigning a $300 price target.\nSimilarly, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee reaffirmed his bullish buy rating on Apple stock, boosting his price target to $245 from $225. Chatterjee expects Apple to sell 244 million iPhones next year, representing a solid 10% jump from the 222 million expected this year. Additionally, he forecasts sales to climb to a massive 268 million by 2026. Additionally, he's raising estimates for services growth, which will be driven by stronger monetization through third-party AI applications in the coming years.\nAuthors own based on historical data\nThe chart above shows the global trajectory of iPhone sales from 2007 to 2023, highlighting their growth and steady performance over the years. Since 2015, iPhone sales growth has been relatively flat, with considerable drops in 2018 and 2019. However, growth has picked up remarkably since 2021, and based on Chatterjee's estimates, we could see 5% to 10% growth in the upcoming years, with robust upside expected from the introduction of Apple Intelligence.\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst for iPhone stock over the years has been the strength of its bottom line and its stand-out liquidity metrics. Therefore, despite the relatively uninspiring iPhone sales, the stock has returned more than 54% in the past three years, beating the S&P 500's 28% gain. Its diversified services and hardware ecosystem and effective cost management continue to fuel its robust earnings.\nGurufocus rates Apple's profitability rates at a perfect 10/10, showcasing its dominance in financial strength compared to its peers and historical metrics. The company's gross margin of almost 46% is comfortably ahead of industry averages, reflecting its superior cost management and premium pricing power. A major driver behind Apple's success has been a shift towards services, accounting for 22.2% of total sales. Additionally, this segment surged from $3.69 billion in Q1 2013 to a remarkable $24.2 billion in Q3 2024.\nFurthermore, the company's operating margin at 31.27% and net margin at 26.44% are equally impressive, highlighting its efficiency in managing its operational expenses. Also, its return on equity (ROE) is at a superb 151.08%, shedding light on its exceptional efficiency in using equity to generate profits. Additionally, Apple's ROIC-WACC% has soared, climbing from 15% in 2020 to an impressive 22% in 2023, indicative of the company's growing ability to generate returns over its cost of capital.\nNaturally, we see that trickle-down effect on its financial strength rating, which attracts an impressive 7 on 10 rating. Perhaps the standout metric for Apple is its exceptional interest coverage ratio of around 120.35 times, showing its powerful ability to meet its interest obligations. Likewise, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.75 aligns with its historical benchmarks and peers, reflecting the effective management of its debt load relative to earnings. On top of that, with a Piotroski F-Score of 8/9 and an Altman Z-Score of 10.13, Apple is deemed financially safe, signaling low distress levels.\nAs I mentioned, Apple's stock has been on a superb run in the past six months after bottoming out in April. The stock has continued to notch higher highs and is currently trading close to its 52-week high price of $237.23. It has been linked to the enthusiasm surrounding its Apple Intelligence, which will likely be a pivotal talking point over the next several months. However, so far, given the relatively strong opening sales for the iPhone 16, without the AI features in place, investors are licking their lips over what's to come. Depending on where it may go from here, the stock has found support around $196.72 and is unlikely to move below that level in the near-term. Moreover, it has seen strong resistance around the $238 mark, close to its 52-week highs.\nApple Stock Seasonality (Courtesy TrendSpider)\nAnother advantage for Apple stock is that October and November historically show strong seasonality, with October standing out, as shown by the chart above. We can see that October tends to be the third-strongest month in terms of seasonality for the tech giant, with July being the strongest.\nFurthermore, Apple's 12-month price target of $240.58 represents almost a 6% upside from current price levels. The high estimate of $300 aligns with Dan Ives's price target, pointing to a superb bullish sentiment, while the low-end projection of $183.90 points to a conservative outlook. Notably, the GF Value of around the $200 mark points to a reversion back to its critical support level, implying that though the stock is considerably overvalued.\nThe bearish picture painted by Apple's GF value is supported by its unattractive pricing metrics at this time. Apple's current price of around $227.40 comfortably exceeds multiple valuation metrics, underscoring its overbought status. Discounted cash flow (DCF) models based on free cash flow and earnings suggest fair values of $154.88 and $174.53, reflecting sizeable gaps of 32% and 23%, respectively. Other metrics, including the Peter Lynch value of $113.99, show an even greater disparity, reinforcing the overvaluation narrative.\nThe chart mirrors 2021 when Apple (AAPL, Financial) saw a healthy bump in iPhone sales driven by the iPhone 12's 5G debut, similar to the current momentum sparked by the iPhone 16's new AI features. However, as you can see from the 2021 chart below, while Apple's stock price is fair value estimates, it still maintained closer alignment with fundamentals compared to 2024. In fact, in 2021, Apple's DCF based on free cash flows was at a solid $149.38, comfortably above its stock price of $132.69, signaling better alignment with its intrinsic value.\nA huge part of Apple's stock's bull case is linked to Apple Intelligence, but multiple risks will likely impact its price. Firstly, AI features central to the iPhone 16's appeal are still in their nascency and will roll out over time, with its most advanced features unlikely to be fully operational until months after launch.\nAdditionally, while commendable, Apple's commitment to privacy could significantly hamper its ability to compete with more aggressive AI development that's taking place at Google and OpenAI. This will likely impact Apple's innovation curve, impacting its long-term bull case. Furthermore, the overvaluation narrative persists with Apple stock, which trades at a premium and already reflects much of the AI-fueled growth potential, as discussed extensively.\nApple stock has been running hot, fueled by the excitement surrounding its highly touted AI-powered features, likely to propel its business into its next phase of expansion. Moreover, iPhone 16 sales are off to a strong start, even without the AI features, pointing to more upside ahead. Additionally, historically, the stock tends to perform well in the next couple of months, adding to its bull case. However, investors should be cautious of the risks, especially if the full potential of Apple Intelligence isn't realized.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Should You Follow Warren Buffett and Sell Apple Stock?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are among the most famous Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors. They started their position in 2016, continually added to it, and rode Apple's growth to impressive gains. However, they've been dumping Apple shares steadily each quarter in 2024. Is it time for other investors to follow suit? After all, the stock is trading near all-time highs.\nBerkshire's Apple stake was biggest in in the third quarter of 2023 at around 915 million shares, making up 50% of its overall portfolio. That's a massive concentration, more than many investors would have chosen.\nHowever, that's not why Buffett decided to sell it. Because Berkshire added to its Apple position along the way, it is sitting on massive gains. Massive gains mean a large tax bill when it comes time to sell. Currently, the capital gains tax rate sits at 21%, a historically low figure. However, there are many proposals to increase this rate to 28%, which would increase the amount of taxes Berkshire owes on its Apple gains.\nThis is the primary reason Buffett is dumping Apple stock: He wants to realize as much of a gain as possible by capitalizing on the low tax rate. He also stated that Apple will likely remain one of Berkshire's largest positions.\nAfter peaking at 915 million Apple shares in Q3, Berkshire reduced its stake to 905 million in Q4, 789 million in the first quarter of 2024, and 400 million in Q2. That's a rapid drawdown, and investors will be curious to see what Berkshire and Buffett have done in the third quarter of this year. That information will be available 45 days after the close of Q3, so investors will get to see Buffett's moves on November 15.\nI predict more Apple stock will be sold by Berkshire, as part of the investment thesis has disappeared.\nWhen Berkshire first took a position in 2016, Apple was trading for around 11 times earnings -- a classic Buffett value investment. Now that value no longer exists.\nApple now trades at an expensive 34.5 times trailing earnings and 30.6 times forward earnings. This could be overlooked if Apple were introducing innovative new devices, selling iPhones like never before, or leading in artificial intelligence. But it's doing none of that, and its growth suffered.\nSince the start of 2023, Apple's best quarter of revenue growth has delivered a paltry 4.9% sales growth. That's not indicative of a company that should trade at 34.5 times earnings.\nBuffett is a value investor who likes a margin of safety in his investments. There is absolutely no margin of safety in Apple right now, as it's trading at a premium price without growing much.\nWhile Buffett may be saying Berkshire is selling Apple stock for tax purposes, I think there's more to the story. If Buffett came out and said, \"Apple stock is overvalued, so I'm selling,\" that would cause a panic, and investors would dump the stock overnight. Berkshire's position is massive, and selling it off will take a long time, so Buffett is likely playing the long game.\nApple's stock is valued too highly for its performance, and I think investors should follow Buffett's lead and exit the stock before it trades at a more reasonable price tag. The broader market (as measured by the S&P 500 index) trades at 24.2 times trailing earnings, and if Apple reverted to a similar price tag, the stock price would fall by about 30%.\nPlenty of companies are cheaper and have better growth than Apple, and investors would be better suited owning those.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 781% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 168% for the S&P 500.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 30, 2024\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple and Berkshire Hathaway.

Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies.

A question to answer is whether Apple's current trading price of US$227 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Apple\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n See our latest analysis for Apple \nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 2.9% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $233.62, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Apple\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Apple's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 36%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in AAPL\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AAPL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Apple and you'll want to know about them.\nIf you are no longer interested in Apple, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the most valuable stock in the world again, with a market cap of $3.4 trillion. Even though its growth rate isn't exactly scorching hot these days, investors remain bullish on its long-term prospects. The launch of the new iPhone along with Apple Intelligence have given investors multiple reasons to remain optimistic that there's still much more revenue growth coming down the pike for the business.\nBut with the stock trading at a high and a fairly expensive 34 times its trailing earnings, should you hold off on buying Apple stock until it dips in value, or are you better off adding it to your portfolio anyway?\nApple's business has multiple catalysts in the wings that should drive sales higher. Many consumers have held off on upgrading their phones, but with the latest iPhone, there could be an incentive to finally upgrade now that new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities will be available with the device. And although the phone itself may not have been all that exciting, early sales numbers indicate that demand could be strong out of the gate.\nMany of the company's new Apple Intelligence features may also not come out until next year and while that might seem like a negative, it could put the iPhone back into the spotlight in 2025 and help remind consumers who didn't upgrade why they should. Some AI features may also require a subscription, which could lead to yet another new element in Apple's growing ecosystem and bolster its service revenue.\nFor investors who are willing to buy for the long term, it's not hard to see why these opportunities in AI could be a big win for the company. Apple has proven over the years it doesn't need some groundbreaking new feature to entice consumers to buy new phones. And the promise of new AI features can provide it with enough of a carrot to get consumers to buy the iPhone 16. Strong sales and profits from that could quickly bring down its earnings multiple. Buying before that happens could ensure investors profit from a good return from the stock.\nApple is trading at a historically high P/E multiple, which implies that investors are already pricing in a lot of the growth. You wouldn't normally expect to be paying 34 times earnings for a company that is growing at a rate of just 5% -- but that's what investors are getting with Apple today. The premium suggests that investors are expecting much more growth in the near term. That means the boost from AI and new iPhone sales may already be priced into the valuation.\nThe risk for investors is that while the early sales numbers and preorders for iPhone 16 may be strong, these are still fairly primitive estimates. The prudent thing may be for investors to wait until at least after the company's next earnings report to get more insight into how well the phone is selling before making assumptions as to whether it will lead to stronger growth down the road. Hype leading up to the new iPhone was strong and consumers may have wanted to jump the line, buying even before seeing how revolutionary it was, for the sake of securing it.\nAs great of a company as Apple is, even it isn't immune to the effects of a downturn in the economy. And should a recession take place, consumers may have an incentive to hold off just a little bit longer in upgrading their phones, especially if the new iPhone and its AI features isn't all that consumers were expecting it to be. If sales don't align with expectations, a sell-off could be inevitable for Apple's stock.\nApple is a great stock to own but I wouldn't buy it today. My concern is that with such a high valuation, expectations are going to be a bit high for the company's upcoming results, and the risk of a correction looks high. If you invest in it for several years, it can still be a great investment. But at the same time, there are many more attractively priced growth stocks that can make for better buys than Apple right now.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 797% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 170% for the S&P 500.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nGlobal management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nBain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks.\nThe research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Bank of America recently released an investor note on the company, reiterating a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $256. In the note, the advisory discussed the several avenues for monetization within the services strategy for Apple, arguing that revenue from downloads of apps using AI on the Apple App Store and the potential for a subscription-based platform for Apple Intelligence itself once Apple AI was further developed had been analyzed and undoubtedly presented a large-scale revenue opportunity for Apple.\nAnalysts at the bank further noted that Siri integration monetization was one we find the most overlooked and had the potential to become very significant over time. According to the bank, deep Siri integration with apps could drive $3 billion in revenues in 2026 and could approach about $50 billion in a decade for Apple Inc.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price has soared 292% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Meanwhile the share price is 1.2% higher than it was a week ago.\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n See our latest analysis for Apple \nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 18% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 31% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Apple the TSR over the last 5 years was 305%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\nApple provided a TSR of 28% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 32% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Apple  you should be aware of.\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave \u2014 particularly in software and cloud services.\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry.

Malik cut the iPhone unit forecasts in the September and December quarters by 2 million each and now expects iPhone 16 units to be 83 million this year. He also increased the March and June 2025 quarter iPhone unit estimates up by 4 million and 7 million, respectively. Citi now expects 2024 and 2025 iPhone units to be 224 million and 246 million, respectively, or down 3% and 9% on a year-over-year basis. With Apple Intelligence to be released in the US later in October and a major Siri update likely next year, the iPhone refresh will happen in 2025 with the iPhone 17 launch, the analyst told investors in the research note.\nLatest reports indicate that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has successfully defended itself against patent infringement claims concerning user verification and data security technology placed into iPhones.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States\u200b. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks.

With the Federal Reserve\u2019s first interest rate cut being all that investors could hope for as it reduced rates by 50 basis points, since the cut, the flagship S&P stock index and the broader NASDAQ stock index are up by 2% and 3%, respectively. The rate cut has also now moved Wall Street\u2019s focus to the next big catalyst for the stock market, i.e, the third quarter earnings season.\nFor a market that has touched new highs this year due to artificial intelligence, the second quarter earnings season was nothing short of fireworks. It saw the AI narrative wobble temporarily after mixed results from the world\u2019s leading AI GPU designer and the semiconductor industry reckoned with the fate of the semiconductor manufacturing stock that ranked 5th on the list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 12 Must-Watch Stocks.\nStarting with the chip maker, its second quarter earnings were nothing short of a bloodbath. They saw the firm\u2019s non GAAP net income drop by a whopping 85% annually and turn a year ago GAAP net income into a non GAAP loss of $1.6 billion. At the same time, its gross margins dropped by 0.4 percentage points, and in the worst example of the cherry on top, the firm also announced that it will be suspending dividends starting from the fourth quarter. As a result, its shares tanked by 30% after the earnings, and since then, we\u2019ve seen multiple reports claim that other companies are interested in acquiring it.\nAs for the GPU designer, its second quarter revenue jumped by 122% \u2013 a no small feat considering that the year ago quarter\u2019s revenue was $13.5 billion. However, even as the Q2 revenue of $30 billion beat analyst estimates of $28.7 billion which was fueled by its AI data center division\u2019s revenue jumping by 154% annually, the shares fell by 6% in extended trading. At the heart of the fall was a tepid third quarter guidance of $32.5 billion (analyst estimates were $31.77 billion), a gross margin miss by 0.1 percentage point, a Q3 margin guidance miss by 0.5 percentage points, and the delay of its Blackwell GPU to the fourth quarter. For investors already worried about the ability of AI to generate a profit, the margin miss in particular wasn\u2019t comforting. Consequently, since the earnings report, the firm\u2019s shares are down by 1%.\nHowever, investment bank Morgan Stanley sent the GPU designer\u2019s shares soaring by 6.8% in September in a bullish note that shared that the firm could earn $10 billion in its fourth quarter alone from the latest Blackwell chips. This upgrade came on the back of MS remaining consistent in its analysis of the stock market this year. The key themes that it has identified are the labor market, commercial real estate, and the split in the stock market between large and small cap stocks.\nIn July, the bank shared that there was \u201cample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery.\u201d In simpler terms, it means that MS believed that for small cap equities to catch up to large caps in performance, the economy has to perform well. If you\u2019re wondering how wide this gap is, data shows that for small and medium cap and large cap stocks which are in the top 20% in terms of free cash flow margins, the small and mid caps have a forward price to earnings ratio of 0.74x relative to large caps as of April 2024, which is quite low when compared to the April 2009 peak of 1.62x. MS reiterated this belief in its August report, which shared that small cap outperformance \u201crequires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates. While recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.\u201d\nHowever, MS\u2019 September report took somewhat of a different tune. It focused on the clean energy and infrastructure investments in the US to share that these could help some segments of the American stock market that are typically dependent on growth in economic activity. Government spending through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the CHIPS and Science Act have led to roughly $500 billion in commitments by the private sector to invest in a diverse set of areas ranging from roads, to clean energy manufacturing and heavy industry.\nAs per the bank, \u201cGovernment policies such as the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Act are sponsoring growth in many areas of U.S. manufacturing. These trends could offer through-the-cycle structural support to areas of the economy that are traditionally very cyclical.\u201d On the data front, MS reveals that while in 2022, US manufacturing capacity as a percentage of 2017 output sat at ~126%, this has jumped to nearly 129% as of 2024.\nShifting gears, the third quarter earnings season will soon start to shape how investors view the market. Data from LSEG shows that the flagship S&P index is expected to deliver 5.4% annual earnings growth during Q3. FactSet is more cautious, as it shares that the index should grow earnings by 4.6% annually to mark its sixth straight quarter of growth. MS is of the view that the economy has to continue to deliver on the data front if the stock market is to perform well.\nIn a recent podcast, the bank\u2019s chief investment officer and chief strategist, Mike Wilson, shared that \u201cthe unemployment rate will need to decline and the payrolls above 140,000 with no negative revisions to prior months. Meanwhile, I am also watching several other variables closely to determine the trajectory of growth. Earnings revision breadth, the best proxy for company guidance, continues to trend sideways for the overall S&P 500 and negatively for the Russell 2000 small cap index. Due to seasonal patterns, this variable is likely to face negative headwinds over the next month.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Morgan Stanley\u2019s best Overweight and quality stocks, we ranked the bank\u2019s recent list of 66 stocks with Overweight ratings, a higher than median quality score, and one month upward EPS revisions by their percentage one month average analyst revisions. The average EPS data was sourced from Yahoo Finance as of September 26th 2024, and the top 25 stocks with non zero percent revisions were selected.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a dominating player in the global consumer electronics industry. The firm derives 52% of its revenue from the iPhone lineup, which makes smartphones a key part of its hypothesis. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s market value of $3.46 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world, is built on the iPhone\u2019s brand loyalty and based on belief surrounding the firm\u2019s superior product design, manufacturing, and marketing practices. Consequently, any weakness in iPhone sales also tends to impact the share price. As an example, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares slid by nearly 3% in mid September after TF Securities\u2019 well known iPhone analyst Ming-Chi Kuo noted that the first weekend sales of the latest iPhone 16 lineup were 12% lower than the year ago comparable figures for the iPhone 15. However, he added that the iPhone 16\u2019s key differentiating factor, Apple Intelligence, was not available at launch. This suggests that if the analyst is correct, then the feature\u2019s introduction could prove to be a catalyst to the sales and consequently, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock.\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cRecent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks\u00a011th when we look at Morgan Stanley's top overweight stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "Smartphone sales of Huawei Technologies on the mainland surpassed those of Apple in August - the first time in 46 months, according to a new report by research firm CINNO - as the US-sanctioned company continues to ride on the success of its 5G handset comeback last year.\nThat aligned with findings from government think tank China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, which reported a 12.7 per cent year-on-year decline in foreign smartphone shipments, including Apple's iPhone, in the same month. Those shipments fell to 1.87 million units in August, from 2.14 million a year earlier, as domestic smartphone shipments rose 26.7 per cent to 24.05 million during the same period.\nCINNO did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nCompetition between Huawei and Apple in the world's biggest smartphone market has taken on new significance, as the Shenzhen-based telecommunications equipment giant has seen a revival of its handset business amid the US tech giant's recent struggles on the mainland.\nStrong demand for Huawei's high-end handset models, such as the Mate and Pura series, as well as foldable smartphones like the recently launched Mate XT, helped lift the firm's average selling price and wholesale revenue to record highs in the second quarter, according to TechInsights. It said China remains Huawei's core market, accounting for 89 per cent of its global smartphone shipments.\nChina's smartphone market has steadily gained momentum this year, with more consumers gravitating towards local brands. Huawei, which leads the market, had a 17.5 per cent share in the first half, when total domestic shipments exceeded 140 million units to grow 7.7 per cent from a year ago, according to data from research firm IDC.\nHuawei's Mate XT trifold 5G smartphone generated plenty of buzz last month, when it was released on the same day Apple's iPhone 16 series hit store shelves in almost 60 countries.\nAhead of the new iPhone's release, Apple fell out of the top-five smartphone vendor rankings in China during the second quarter. Apple's market share on the mainland shrank to less than 14 per cent, according to IDC.\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant's revenue in the Greater China region - comprising the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan - reached US$14.73 billion in the June quarter, down 6.5 per cent from the same period last year.\nCustomers inside an Apple Store in Shanghai when the iPhone 16 series was officially released in almost 60 countries on September 20, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Customers inside an Apple Store in Shanghai when the iPhone 16 series was officially released in almost 60 countries on September 20, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg>\nApple's iPhone assembly orders mostly remained unchanged from previous market estimates, according to Kuo Ming-chi, an Apple-focused analyst at TF International Securities.\n\"Suppliers had been asked to continue producing two [iPhone 16] Pro models during China's National Day holiday, indicating that demand for the Pro models has generally met expectations so far,\" Kuo wrote in an X post on Wednesday.\nWhile Apple chief executive Tim Cook had expressed confidence over the firm's long-term prospects in China, mainland consumers' enthusiasm for the iPhone 16 has suffered because Apple Intelligence - the firm's on-device artificial intelligence (AI) system - will not be available in the Chinese language until next year. Generative AI systems are also heavily regulated in the country.\n\"The next focus will be the impact on US market demand [or] shipments after Apple Intelligence becomes available in late October,\" Kuo said. He maintains his previous production estimate for the iPhone 16 series at 88 million to 89 million units in the fourth quarter.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Let it stream. Do not defend these now. Let this money leave. On China only BABA has actual fundamentals if you must... But let it rain here.

        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) notched a record high closing price as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company.\nShares rose 2.4% Monday to above $138. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. \nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings.\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201d\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chips has been \u201cinsane.\u201d\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Bank of America recently reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $256. In a research note on the firm, the advisory noted that tracking of iPhone ship dates on Apple's own website, and various carrier websites, indicated that as of October 2, or 20 days after preorders started, ship time in days for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models were extended, but somewhat less, on average, compared to prior years. Globally, per the advisory, on average, ship time for the iPhone 16 Pro was currently at 13 days, while iPhone 16 Pro Max stood at 20 days. The note detailed that the initial demand for the phones could be lower due to the unavailability of Apple Intelligence at launch, but would pick up after the AI features were available.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.3%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $94.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $390.63 billion and $424.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +8.6%, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Nike",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nike (NYSE: NKE) are two of the most iconic American brands. Apple is the country's top smartphone maker and the world's most valuable company. Nike is the world's largest producer of athletic footwear.\nBut over the past five years, Apple's stock quadrupled while Nike's stock declined more than 10%. If we include reinvested dividends, Apple's stock generated a total return of 313% as Nike's total return was negative 7%. Let's consider why Apple outperformed Nike -- and whether it remains a more compelling investment.\nApple's revenue rose 8% in its fiscal 2022 (which ended in September 2022), but fell 3% in its fiscal 2023. Declining sales of iPhones, Macs, and iPads offset the growth of its services segment which houses its App Store, iCloud, and subscription services. It still generates approximately half of its revenue from the iPhone.\nIn the first nine months of its fiscal 2024, Apple's revenue grew by less than 1% year over year as declining sales of iPhones, iPads, and other devices offset its rising Mac and services revenue. However, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 9% and 17%, respectively, for the full year, as its smartphone sales are expected to surge thanks to the debut of the iPhone 16 late in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 8% and 12%, respectively, as its Mac and iPad sales stabilize, it expands its services segment, and new generative AI features draw more consumers to its latest iPhones. That's a promising outlook, but the stock doesn't look cheap at 30 times estimated forward earnings.\nApple could struggle to meet Wall Street's optimistic expectations. The iPhone 16 is already being discounted on top e-commerce platforms in China, and the company is reportedly developing a new low-end iPhone SE to reach more customers. Its use of a \"walled garden\" strategy -- creating a closed ecosystem of hardware and services that enhances Apple's control over every aspect of its products and incentivizes users to stick with them -- is also being closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe.\nApple claims the new AI services it is launching will drive its near-term growth. The company was also sitting on $153 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of its latest quarter -- a cash hoard that provides plenty of room to make fresh investments or acquisitions. Apple is still a good safe-haven stock, but its high valuation, regulatory threats, and overwhelming dependence on the iPhone could limit its near-term gains. It probably won't soar much higher unless it tosses a few more irons in the fire.\nNike's revenue rose by 10% in fiscal 2023 (which ended in May 2023), but has been sliding in fiscal 2024 due to a severe slowdown in North America that offset its stronger growth in China and other overseas markets.\nOver the past decade, Nike expanded its direct-to-consumer Nike Direct channel (which houses its e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar stores) to reduce its dependence on third-party retailers. That strategy initially widened its moat against its competitors, locked in its customers, and shielded its brand from third-party markdowns.\nBut over the past year, Nike Direct's sales dried up as macroeconomic headwinds throttled the market's demand for its lower-end products. It also struggled to keep pace with faster-growing competitors like On Holding (NYSE: ONON) in the wholesale market. Nike is now trying to rebuild its wholesale relationships with retail chains, but it could take a lot of effort to reverse its slide and grow its market share in that fragmented channel again.\nNike expects the slowdown to continue even as it tries to reboot its business by launching new products, pivoting to a product mix with a larger share of higher-end shoes, and deepening its relationships with consumers through sponsored events and activities. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline by 7% and 28%, respectively, in its fiscal 2025.\nThat's a grim outlook, but they also expect its revenue and earnings to grow by 5% and 16%, respectively, in fiscal 2026 as its turnaround efforts begin to bear fruit. The company still ended its last quarter with $10.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, so it certainly won't run out of cash while it works to fix its business. Yet Nike's stock still seems pricey at 30 times estimated forward earnings -- and it probably won't attract too much attention from the bulls until more green shoots appear.\nApple and Nike both face a lot of near-term challenges. However, I believe Apple will continue to outperform Nike for four simple reasons: It's growing faster, its business model is stickier, it faces fewer direct competitors, and it's still holding a lot more cash. Nike's stock might eventually bounce back, but it will need to rebuild its wholesale business and meaningfully widen its moat against formidable challengers like On Holding first.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Title": "Invest in the \u2018Apple II Moment\u2019 for Autonomous Vehicles",
        "Author": "  Louis Navellier ",
        "Text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern, Elon Musk is set to reveal the biggest launch of his career: the Robotaxi. This long-awaited reveal could turn science fiction into reality, making autonomous vehicles possible.\nI know\u2026 you might be thinking a driverless car seems a little far-fetched. But so were personal computers (PCs) back in the 90s. Yet Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak made an entire market out of PCs, and the rest is history.\nAnd as my InvestorPlace colleague, Luke Lango, recently explained in a special briefing earlier this week, autonomous driving is already becoming a reality. (And he even has the video of his own experience to prove it.) But with Tesla\u2019s event quickly approaching, this briefing won\u2019t be around for much longer. It is being taken down tonight, so this could be your last chance to check it out.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nNow, you might be wondering, how can I profit from this? Today, Luke is going to explain how you can do just that. Take it away, Luke.\nWhen Steve Jobs leapfrogged the entire computer industry to make Apple Inc. (AAPL), he managed to turn science fiction into reality. Eventually, Apple became one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies\u2026\nBecause out-of-the-box computing was still more sci-fi than reality, there was NO market for personal computers when Apple\u2019s early dynamic duo \u2014 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak \u2014 set about to build the Apple I.\nThe pair created the market.\nBoth Jobs and Wozniak invented the Apple I for one simple reason \u2014 because they wanted a personal-use computer and the options at the time were impractical.\nIn the mid-1960s, roughly half of all the world\u2019s computers were IBM 1401s, which replaced bulky vacuum tubes with transistors. The 1401 was considered the Model T of computers because it sold well (for the time), producing 12,000 units and making the case for the computer as a general-purpose (as opposed to hobbyist) machine.\nHowever, the 1401 weighed about five tons all-in. It\u2019s not exactly something Jobs and Woz could lug around to their friends\u2019 houses.\nThen there was the Altair 8800, a DIY computer popular among hobbyists. In fact, it was the Altair from which Jobs and Woz drew inspiration for the Apple I.\nTheir desire to build a computer that could make life easier for everyone led to the Apple II, the first true PC designed for consumers.\nRather than weighing a literal ton or being packaged as a single board meant to be installed by folks with the know-how, the Apple II resembled an ordinary home appliance:\nRight out of the box, ordinary folks without strong technical knowledge, could be up and running in relatively little time.\nIt was the world\u2019s first truly customer-friendly, pre-assembled computer for the masses, and it set the stage for the computer industry to this day.\nHere\u2019s Steve Wozniak reflecting on his time at Apple:\nEvery single Apple project \u2013 computers, hard disks, everything \u2013 I had never designed those things ever in my life\u2026 I had no training in them, but I was so good at taking the little parts \u2013 like pieces of wood to build a building \u2013 that I could architect something that was perfect. And really better than the people that were used to doing it would do.\nWoz isn\u2019t bragging here. He\u2019s making an important point\u2026\nWhile education and training are important, nothing is a substitute for unbridled creativity and innovation.\nHere\u2019s Woz again:\nA person who knows how to take the little elements and build on them, and write the book of how you actually put them into play, a person who comes up with the ability to write the book, I think is better than someone who knows how to do it from past experience.\nI bring this up because, right now,the world\u2019s most powerful companies are racing to develop top-tier artificial intelligence.\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and others have invested billions in AI technologies.\nSo far, they\u2019ve mainly followed the established practice laid out by OpenAI\u2026\nBut there\u2019s one company with foresight, patience, and commitment to innovation that could do for AI that Apple did for computing\u2026\nYou see, in just a few short days, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man \u2014 will unveil a new AI-powered product that some believe could be as impactful as the iPhone, the Model 3, or the first PC.\nIt\u2019s called the Robotaxi. And it promises to shock the world.\nReportedly, the vehicle will be a fully self-driving car, without any steering wheel or pedals. Early descriptions reveal that it\u2019s likely to comprise a two-seat interior with a large center console. Musk says it will also have the lowest cost-per-mile of any transportation option.\nAnd supposedly, it will be accompanied by its own ride-hailing app (just like Uber), allowing customers to fetch autonomous rides in the Robotaxi at the push of a button.\nNow, if that all sounds like science fiction, that\u2019s because it was born of it.\nBut that\u2019s what Elon Musk could do at his \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event later this evening. That\u2019s when he is expected to reveal the Robotaxi. He could turn science fiction into reality. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting about this upcoming debut.\nIt echoes Woz\u2019s belief that those who \u201cwrite the book\u201d on new technologies are ultimately more valuable than those who follow established practices.\nAnd as we\u2019ve outlined above, that\u2019s when the magic happens.\nThink about it\u2026 A mobile telephone that put the power of the internet into the palms of our hands, keeping us connected to everything anywhere we go? That surely sounded like science fiction back in the mid-2000s. Yet, Apple made it a reality with the iPhone \u2013 and in so doing, created a transformational product that fundamentally changed the world.\nWhen science fiction turns into reality, a sort of magic happens. The world is forever changed. And savvy investors are offered the opportunity to make potential fortunes.\nElon Musk could do just that at the \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event later this evening, around 10 p.m. Eastern.\nIn so doing, he will bring much-needed publicity to all the exciting developments happening in the world of autonomous vehicles (AVs) right now.\nAnd that, my friends, could push a flood of money into AV stocks.\nThe question is: When a revolutionary new product launches, what\u2019s the best way to invest in its success?\nBy buying shares of the company that created it, right?\nMaybe not.\u00a0\nJust consider: Ever since Apple launched the first iPhone in June 2007, Apple stock has taken off like a rocket ship. It has risen more than 6,000% in value since that time. But do you know which stock the iPhone propelled even higher? Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) \u2013 an important Apple supplier. Its stock is up more than 16,000% since the first iPhone\u2019s launch:\nAnother great example is Tesla\u2019s Model 3. Many consider it to be the most transformational electric vehicle (EV) \u2013 the car that really brought EVs to the mainstream. And, indeed, ever since its launch in July 2017, Tesla stock has absolutely soared, climbing about 1,500% higher.\nBut to create such a world-changing new product, Tesla was using chips from another company, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), to power the Model 3\u2019s unique Autopilot technology. And guess what? NVIDIA\u2019s stock is up around 14,000% since that vehicle\u2019s debut.\nYou get the point. Sometimes, the best way to play a revolutionary new product launch is not to buy the stock of the headline company making the product.\nOften, it\u2019s the suppliers that outperform.\nAnd that\u2019s why I want to turn your attention to the next batch of potential superstar supplier stocks.\nOf course, if Robotaxi scales into a world-changing product over the next few years, TSLA stock will soar. But history suggests that certain supplier stocks could rise even more.\nTo prepare for this potential watershed moment, I just held a special briefing to discuss important developments in the autonomous vehicle industry, the Robotaxi launch and unveiled a playbook of what I believe are some of the best AV tech supplier stocks to buy now.\nThis event is centered around Robotaxi\u2019s launch, but it\u2019s about much more than that. It focuses on the groundbreaking autonomous vehicle revolution and, more importantly, how to potentially profit from it. But as we are mere hours away from Tesla\u2019s event, your window to watch my special briefing is closing.\nThis could be your last chance to watch this, so join me now to prepare for this new era of transportation. Let\u2019s make this launch work for us.\nSincerely,\nLuke Lango\nEditor, Hypergrowth Investing\nThe post Invest in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Apple II Moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for Autonomous Vehicles appeared first on InvestorPlace.\n"

        "Title": "WhatsApp vs. Apple Messages: Which is the better messaging app in 2024?",
        "Author": "  Michael Grothaus ",
        "Text": "Messaging apps are one of the most frequently used apps on our phones. There\u2019s probably not a day that goes by when most people don\u2019t hear a ding alerting them to a new text. There\u2019s also no shortage of messaging apps. But when it comes to the juggernauts, there are two: Meta\u2019s WhatsApp and Apple\u2019s Messages, the latter of which just got a big update in iOS 18.\nMost Read from Fast Company\nWhere the regional housing market is shifting\u2014and where it isn\u2019t\nAn egg recall linked to deadly salmonella in multiple states is growing: Check your cartons right now\nGrowing green jobs\nSo, how do the two apps now compare in 2024? We\u2019ll explore this, based on five criteria: user interface, compatibility, useful features, fun factor, and privacy and security.\nMost users like their apps to have clean, uncluttered interfaces that are easy to navigate.\nWithout a doubt, Apple\u2019s Messages app fulfills these requirements. When you open the app, you are immediately presented with its minimalist interface, which clearly shows a list of all your chat threads. You have a search bar at the top and can quickly tap on any thread to see its contents. Further, there is a single + button that opens a menu that lets you quickly add a photo, audio message, or location to the chat in a few taps.\nWhatsApp\u2019s user interface, on the other hand, is more convoluted. At the bottom of the app is a toolbar with five buttons: Updates, Calls, Communities, Chats, and Settings. These \u201cUpdates\u201d and \u201cCommunities\u201d additions can make WhatsApp feel more like a social network than a dedicated messaging app. Because features such as these are built into WhatsApp, the app is naturally more bloated.\nWinner: Apple Messages\nFor a messaging app to be useful, you need to have someone to chat with. That means your friends must be using the same messaging technology as you are.\nThis is where Apple loses some points. If you have an iPhone, you can exchange SMS and RCS messages with people on other devices with Apple Messages. But you can only send iMessages\u2014Apple\u2019s proprietary version of the text message\u2014to owners of other Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. iMessages (the blue bubbles and all the cool abilities that go with them) are officially limited to Apple products.\nApple doesn\u2019t make its Messages app for Android devices. That means if you want to use just a single messaging app and be able to take advantage of all its features in every conversation, you better make sure all your friends and family are iPhone owners.\nWhatsApp, on the other hand, is available on both iPhones and Android devices. That makes it super easy to communicate with the full feature set of the app with anyone, no matter what type of phone they have.\nWinner: WhatsApp\nWhen it comes to features, both WhatsApp and Apple\u2019s Messages offer many of the same. For example, both apps let you send your location, photos, videos, and more with a few taps. Both apps also feature built-in GIF libraries, so you can easily insert the perfect GIF into your conversation at any given moment.\nBoth apps also support emoji reactions, so you can quickly slap with a \u201cthank you\u201d hands on their message without having to literally spell out your appreciation. Both apps also let you unsend and edit messages\u2014a truly useful feature.\nBut Apple Messages also offers some useful features that WhatsApp lacks, such as the ability to schedule an iMessage to be sent at a later time. WhatsApp doesn\u2019t offer this kind of functionality. Apple Messages also offers a safety feature called Check In that allows Messages to automatically notify your chosen contacts when you arrive home on time\u2014or don\u2019t.\nYet WhatsApp also offers some features that Apple\u2019s Messages does not: the ability to archive messages, for one. In WhatsApp, you can store message threads in an archive, so they don\u2019t clutter up your main chat screen. This is handy when you don\u2019t want to delete a thread (say, the one with your electrician), but you don\u2019t constantly need to see it in your main chat list, either.\nYes, archiving is an exceptionally basic feature\u2014but that\u2019s what makes its absence from Apple Messages so baffling, especially given how useful chat archiving is. WhatsApp also includes some other nice utilitarian features including the ability to star important messages so you can easily find them later.\nWinner: WhatsApp\nI\u2019m the type of person who just likes to send and receive plain old messages without any fluff. However, I know many people who like to use messaging apps to express their moods or send messages with some added pizazz.\nAnd when it comes to adding pizazz to your messages, Apple\u2019s iOS 18 update to Messages offers a lot. Not only can you bold, italicize, underline, and strikethrough text now, but you can add animation effects to individual words in your text message\u2014like making the word grow big or small, making it shake or explode, as well as making it ripple and jitter and more.\nOther visual flairs you can add include making a chat bubble show up on the recipient\u2019s screen under so-called \u201cinvisible ink\u201d (but really, it looks like digital glitter that they must wipe away to see the message). There are also full-screen effects you can apply, such as making confetti rain down on the recipient\u2019s screen when you send them a congratulations text.\nWhatsApp lacks any of these types of animated effects, so if fun factor is your thing, there\u2019s a clear winner here.\nWinner: Apple Messages\nThe great news is that both WhatsApp and Apple\u2019s Messages feature strong end-to-end encryption\u2014even for chat backups in the cloud (if you enable it). This means that no one, not even Meta or Apple, can read your messages.\nBut Apple\u2019s Messages offers two benefits over WhatsApp. The first is that WhatsApp still requires you to give it access to your contacts on your phone if you want to see the names of the people you are texting in the app instead of just their phone numbers. There is no technical reason why WhatsApp needs to require this. The app allows people to choose display names, and it would be simple for the company to make these display names the default for what a user sees if they don\u2019t grant access to their contacts.\nThe second reason is that though WhatsApp and Apple\u2019s Messages are both end-to-end encrypted, that encryption only helps protect against today\u2019s threats\u2014not threats from advanced quantum computers tomorrow. To counteract quantum computer threats (quantum computers may one day be able to break today\u2019s encryption in minutes), Apple has added post-quantum cryptographic protocol level 3 (PQ3) to Messages. That means your iMessages today will still be protected against quantum attacks tomorrow.\nWhatsApp currently lacks any kind of post-quantum cryptographic protocols.\nWinner: Apple Messages\nBased on the above criteria, the winner is Apple Messages. The app offers an uncluttered, easy-to-navigate interface, has several fun text and chat effects, and has the most advanced security protecting your messages that is available today.\nStill, WhatsApp is no slouch. It has feature-parity with Apple Messages in all of the areas that really count, like unsending and editing messages. It also has basic features that Apple Messages lacks, like archiving. And its biggest strength will always be something Apple refuses to offer: cross-device support. No matter if you have an Android or iPhone, you can send and receive WhatsApp messages.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

        "Text": "Big-name companies like Apple are most likely already in your investment portfolio because they have a reliable business model that is known to perform well in the stock market. However, even the most thriving business is still subject to the whims of the market, supply-and-demand issues and other problems. Apple is no exception.\nWhile it\u2019s a good stock to hold in many ways, investment experts do have some concerns about the tech giant that you may want to consider when investing.\nCheck Out: Apple Is Making Low-Cost Hearing Aids \u2014 Here\u2019s How Retirees Can Take Advantage\nRead Next: 9 Easy Ways To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nWhile Apple is a tech leader, its overreliance on iPhone sales concerns Vincent Cerniglia, principal and vice president of Noreast Capital Corporation. He advised caution in investing heavily in any single company, especially if demand slows or rivals release quality alternatives at lower price points.\nAdditionally, Cerniglia said, \u201cSupply chain risks also worry me. Many components are made in China, exposing Apple to trade war costs and supply chain disruptions that could reduce profit margins.\u201d\nCertainly, as the COVID-19 pandemic revealed, unforeseen events such as viruses and war can disrupt supply chains.\nSee More: 8 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024\nThough Apple will likely remain successful, Cerniglia worried that its growth may slow in emerging or saturated markets as more competition arises.\n\u201cThe smartphone market is maturing, and competitors are releasing affordable, high-quality devices. If Apple\u2019s premium model loses appeal or lower-cost rivals win market share, financials and stock price could suffer.\u201d\nOther areas of concern, according to Angelo Crocco, CPA and owner of AC Accounting, have to do with regulatory challenges.\n\u201cApple\u2019s been pushing hard into financial services with things like Apple Pay and the Apple Card, and while that\u2019s opening up new revenue streams, there\u2019s also some risk here that\u2019s easy to overlook,\u201d he said.\nIn Europe, regulators are already starting to question whether Apple\u2019s tight grip on the NFC technology that powers Apple Pay is stifling competition, he explained.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re forced to open up their NFC system to other companies, Apple could lose some of the dominance it\u2019s built in the digital payments space. This could hit their bottom line, especially in markets where regulatory bodies are becoming more aggressive.\u201d\nHe said it\u2019s something that Apple investors need to keep an eye on.\nAnother area where Apple may be losing dominance is in its \u201cwearables\u201d such as\u00a0the Apple Watch and AirPods.\nWhile wearables have been successful so far, Crocco said the company is very reliant on continuous innovation, especially in the health space.\n\u201cIf Apple doesn\u2019t keep delivering meaningful updates like better health-tracking features, demand could start to flatten out, and we\u2019ve seen that happen before with other tech products,\u201d Crocco explained.\nApple\u2019s overreliance on a single product line in an increasingly competitive space gives reason for caution despite its brand and cash position, Cerniglia said. \u201cRevenue and stock price are closely tied to iPhone success, so diversification would strengthen [its] position.\u201d\nIn lieu of being able to influence any of these factors as an individual investor, for balance, Apple should be part of an investment portfolio but not necessarily an outsized holding, Cerniglia suggested.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n10 Housing Markets That Will Plummet in Value Before the End of 2024\n5 Low-Risk Accounts Financially Savvy People Trust for Reliable Returns (And How You Can Use Them)\nI'm a Debt Expert: Here's How Social Media Warps Our Perceptions of Debt\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Investment Experts: These Are Our 5 Concerns About Apple\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia notches record high, looks to unseat Apple as world's most valuable company",
        "Author": " Laura Bratton    ",
        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) notched a record high closing price as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company.\nShares rose 2.4% Monday to above $138. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. \nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings.\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201d\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chips has been \u201cinsane.\u201d\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "It's been almost two full years since OpenAI released ChatGPT and captured the world's attention overnight. In the months that followed ChatGPT's arrival, Microsoft invested billions into OpenAI, while Alphabet and Amazon each invested in a rival start-up called Anthropic.\nMoreover, everyone already knows that Nvidia has been leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution thanks to its GPU and data center services. Meanwhile, Tesla is using AI to to build self-driving cars and humanoid robots.\nBut what about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)? Besides a small-scale acquisition and the introduction of Apple Intelligence -- which has yet to fully scale -- Apple has remained quiet about its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions.\nBelow, I will outline my prediction of what Apple may do in order to make a splash in the AI realm and explain how such a move could reignite growth at the company.\nWhile Apple could follow in the steps of its \"Magnificent Seven\" cohorts and explore developing their own chips or building a custom large language model (LLM), I see both of these scenarios as highly unlikely.\nInstead, I think Apple is going to make a big-ticket acquisition -- and no, I'm not talking about Rivian Automotive. Rather, I think Apple is going to acquire a medical device company.\nOne area of the AI landscape that I continue to think goes overlooked is healthcare. AI has many applications when it comes to health and wellness, and yet I haven't seen too much focus on this pocket of artificial intelligence yet. Apple, for its part, has shown some interest in health management over the years.\nFor example, the Apple Watch features numerous health-focused tools including monitoring heart rates, sensing irregular movements or rhythms as it pertains to atrial fibrillation, tracking mobility, and even managing medications.\nIn addition, the Apple Watch also contains sensors that can monitor sleep patterns. Meanwhile, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 have hearing aid functionality and can monitor noise levels in your environment.\nAs I wrote previously, Precedence Research is forecasting the total addressable market for healthcare AI to reach $614 billion by early next decade. Precedence cites Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart wearables, as well as software and services integrated in these tools are some of the catalysts fueling AI in healthcare.\nMaking an acquisition in the healthcare space could put Apple in a leading position of an otherwise underserved area of the AI landscape. And considering Apple already has a roster of health-focused hardware, software, and services, I think acquiring a medical devices company to expand its portfolio is a natural complement.\nMoreover, should Apple make such a move, consumers who use any of Apple's new healthcare devices will only further be engrained in the company's ecosystem of installed devices.\nI see a few obvious reasons why my prediction may never come true.\nFirst, Apple is not known for large acquisitions. The company is known for its in-house innovation chops, and has rarely made billion-dollar acquisitions to help spark new growth or augment existing product lines.\nSecond, Apple's latest device has largely been unsuccessful. Of course, I'm talking about its virtual reality headset, Vision Pro. If Apple were to acquire a medical device company with the intent of bolstering the Apple Watch or AirPods and ultimately fail to do so, investors are going to start wondering if the company's best days of developing industry-leading hardware and software are behind it.\nLastly, Apple's new iPhone literally just hit the market a few weeks ago. The launch serves as Apple's long-awaited foray into the AI market. If initial views of Apple Intelligence are uninspiring, the company will probably be better off improving existing services as opposed to going out and buying another asset that will require hefty integration and product development efforts.\nAt the end of the day, I think Apple making deeper moves in AI-powered healthcare could be a game changer. But with that said, such an idea is purely speculation on my part. A lot would need to go right for Apple to pull off a move like this, and it's entirely possible that the company doubles down on its already established AI protocols and relies on those to gain market share on industry incumbents.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "The Art of Valuation: Discovering Apple Inc's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus News ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-10-14, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $159.10. It's currently trading at a price of $227.55. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -43.02%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.57\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.1%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n85.25\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n73.85\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n159.10\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $141.51. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -60.8%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Prosper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Getting to a $1 trillion market cap is such a challenging milestone that only a handful of corporations have done it. The list includes several tech giants, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Though this elite club is highly exclusive, more companies will eventually join it. Stocks that are headed that way might be worth serious consideration. Let's look at two: Visa (NYSE: V) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO). These companies could be trillion-dollar stocks by 2030.\nVisa runs one of the largest payment networks in the world, helping facilitate millions of daily credit card transactions. The company has delivered excellent returns during the past decade as cash transactions continue to be replaced by other payment forms. Visa's market cap is just under $550 billion as of this writing -- so it needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 10.5% to become a trillion-dollar company by the end of 2030. That's well within the company's powers. For one, Visa has performed much better than that during the past decade.\nOf course, that doesn't guarantee the company will deliver the same returns in the future, but some of the underlying factors that led to such solid performances in the past for the business are still in place. Visa remains a leader in its industry, with its only true noteworthy competitor being Mastercard (NYSE: MA). Visa still benefits from network effects: The more people carry credit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive its ecosystem becomes to merchants, and vice versa. That helps ensure that it will remain a major player in this industry for a while.\nVisa also still has plenty of room to grow. Credit card penetration is relatively high in many developed countries, but not so in others. In developing countries, there is even more potential. Visa sees a $20 trillion opportunity across a range of payments it can capture. The company's revenue of about $35 billion in the trailing 12-month period is a tiny percentage of that total. If Visa can make headway in its addressable market, the company's revenue, earnings, and stock price should move in the same direction they have during the past 10 years.\nThe company is well-equipped to deliver a CAGR of more than 10.5% through 2030.\nAs of this writing, Novo Nordisk's market cap is about $400 billion. To hit $1 trillion, it would need a CAGR of about 16.5%. That would be an impressive average to maintain for six years, but Novo Nordisk has been more than impressive recently. Brand names like Wegovy and Ozempic have become famous. Both are GLP-1 medicines that treat obesity and diabetes, respectively. Novo Nordisk has been one of the pioneers in the GLP-1 weight loss market, which is now attracting pharmaceutical companies left and right.\nSome analysts estimate that the weight loss drug market will hit $150 billion by the early 2030s -- it was worth just $24 billion last year. And although there will be plenty of challengers, Novo Nordisk's pipeline in this field is second to none. The company's most promising programs include an oral medicine called amycretin, and CagriSema, which some have estimated could generate as much as $20.2 billion in revenue by 2030.\nThat barely scratches the surface of Novo Nordisk's pipeline, though. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) is being tested in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, two areas with high unmet needs. The company is developing several other diabetes and obesity medicines, and a range of treatments for various rare diseases. Novo Nordisk's revenue has grown rapidly during the past five years, as have its stock price and market cap.\nThe drugmaker should earn important approvals during the next few years, which will help it continue generating excellent financial results through the end of the decade. Becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2030 is well within Novo Nordisk's reach, and it should continue beating the market beyond that.\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zarah Hamid ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) stands against the other undervalued REIT stocks.\nHistorically, REITs are a major beneficiary of rate cuts. They tend to outperform markets if cuts are followed by a recession while they perform in line with the S&P in the case of no recession. Laurel Durkay, Morgan Stanley Investment Management head of global listed real assets, previously mentioned to CNBC that the REITs that are going to benefit the most from a rate cut would be net lease companies that would experience an improved acquisition spread and a better cash flow growth as a direct result of the rate cut.\nFurthermore, REITs are more resilient as they continue to capitalize on the trends that persist regardless of the volatility in conventional real estate. For instance, data center REITs benefit from AI trends, health care REITs benefit from an aging demographic, and housing REITs benefit from the housing affordability issues persistent in the United States.\nIn recent news, Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed towards further, smaller rate cuts saying that the Fed is not on any preset course. \u00a0Two more rate cuts are to be witnessed this year in case the economy performs as expected. However, these cuts will be smaller and not as aggressive as the first half percentage point rate cut. The rate cut is taking center stage at the REIT conference in NYC, as reported by CNBC.\nThis rate cut is positive news for the REIT sector as seconded by Conor Flynn, CEO of Kimco Realty. In his opinion, the potential rate cut would change investor appetite in real estate investment trusts. He believes in a bright outlook for the sector and that the cut would benefit real estate in general as well as his business.\nOur Methodology:\nIn order to compile our list, we first used stock screeners to identify REIT stocks that are trading with a forward P/E under 20, as of October 7. We listed stocks from all sub-segments of the REIT industry. From those, we picked the stocks which have the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 8 most undervalued REIT stocks to buy now have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nLong exposure of a busy city skyline featuring tall roof tops of different hotel brands.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 19\nForward P/E: 17.64\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) is the owner of one of the largest and most diverse portfolios of upscale, rooms-focused hotels in the US. This portfolio comprises 224 hotels with over 30,000 guest rooms positioned in 87 markets across 37 states and the District of Columbia. The REIT was formed in 2007.\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) has a history in the lodging industry of over 20 years through its predecessor companies. The firm\u2019s established portfolio shows that it invests in high-quality hotel properties that are situated in urban, high-end suburban, and developing markets and offer an attractive upside potential. Additionally, the firm has strong relationships with industry-leading brands since its portfolio has 119 Hilton-branded hotels, 100 Marriott-branded hotels, and five Hyatt-branded hotels.\nFor the second quarter ended June 30, comparable Hotels RevPAR increased 2.5% year-over-year. Comparable hotel occupancy was 80% thereby recording an over 2% increase since the preceding year. The steady improvement in midweek business travel demand is expected to be a major opportunity for driving growth. The strength of leisure travel demand was evident during the quarter from the growing occupancy on both weekdays and weekends.\nTherefore, the fundamentals of the business of Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) remain strong. The broadly diversified portfolio, alignment with the best lodging brands, and dominant position in the lodging industry deem the stock attractive.\nOverall APLE ranks 8th on our list of the most undervalued REIT stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of APLE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than APLE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n Disclosure: None.

However, it struggled to turn this popularity into any sort of revenue growth recently, as its most popular device, the iPhone, failed to grow sales meaningfully over the past three years.\nYear\nQ3 iPhone Sales\n2024\n$39.3 billion\n2023\n$39.7 billion\n2022\n$40.7 billion\n2021\n$39.6 billion\nData source: Apple. Note: Apple's Q3 ends around June 30 each year.\nThe big hope was that this year's iPhone 16 launch would trigger an upgrade wave thanks to its ability to run Apple's take on artificial intelligence (AI), Apple Intelligence. Unfortunately for Apple, many reports suggest the demand for the iPhone 16 hasn't been great, affecting a potential business catalyst.\nNvidia isn't having that same problem. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the AI revolution thanks to being best-in-class. The biggest AI companies are buying these GPUs by the thousands, which is massively benefiting Nvidia. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 (ending July 28), Nvidia's revenue rose 122% year over year. That strength is also expected to continue next quarter, with management guiding for $32.5 billion in revenue, or about 80% year over year growth.\nNvidia is also expected see revenue growth at least through next year, as many companies are still building out their AI computing infrastructure. To add to Nvidia's growth potential, it's releasing its Blackwell architecture, unlocking massive speed gains compared to its current Hopper architecture.\nWall Street analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth.\nStill, that growth won't be enough to catch Apple in terms of revenue. So, how could a company that generates far less revenue overtake another as the world's largest company?\nRevenue isn't everything when assessing a company. What matters more are profits and valuation. If the only thing that mattered was revenue, then Walmart would be valued as the world's largest company, as it generated $665 billion in revenue over the past year compared to Apple's $385 billion.\nWhen profits are considered, Nvidia starts to move a bit closer to Apple.\nWhile Nvidia is rapidly closing the gap, it still generates about half the profits of Apple. But with its growth pace and stronger profit margin (55% compared to 26% for Apple), Nvidia could quickly catch Apple's profit levels.\nBy the end of the next fiscal year for each company (Apple's ends around the end of September while Nvidia's ends in January), if each business maintains its current profit margin, Apple will generate about $110 billion in profits, while Nvidia would be slightly below at $98 billion.\nThat's a huge gap to close in just a year's time, but if Nvidia's business grows the way analysts think it can, it will be right there with Apple.\nNext comes valuation. Investors usually give companies premiums if they are growing at a faster pace or have a strong brand. Nvidia has both of these things, which is why its valuation is so high. On the other hand, Apple has a strong brand but slower growth. If Nvidia is expected to keep its revenue growth going through 2026, it will likely fetch a higher premium than Apple, which would probably propel it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company.\nNvidia has a lot going for it, and its financial picture will change substantially over the next year. I think this could be enough to surpass Apple as the world's largest company, as Apple has some growth issues it needs to address.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Want to Buy Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple? Consider This Vanguard Growth ETF",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is home to 500 different companies, but it's weighted by market capitalization, which means the largest names in the index have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest.\nApple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are the top three companies in the S&P 500, with a combined market cap of $9.8 trillion, which represents 19.7% of the index. Nvidia stock, for example, was up 156% through the first half of 2024, which accounted for one-third of the entire 15% gain in the S&P 500.\nIn other words, investors who don't have America's tech giants in their portfolio are probably underperforming the broader market. But there's a simple way to buy them without having to predict which ones might deliver the best returns from here.\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a concentrated portfolio filled with the largest tech stocks an investor could want. Here's why it might be a great alternative to buying individual stocks.\nETFs can hold hundreds, or even thousands, of different stocks. However, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF holds just 71, so it's ideal for investors who already have an existing portfolio, but specifically want to add some exposure to the largest growth companies in America.\nThe ETF holds stocks from 10 different sectors of the economy, but technology has a whopping 61.4% weighting because of the sheer size of companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.\nIn fact, the ETF is highly concentrated toward its top five holdings for that reason. The table shows their weightings in the ETF, compared to their weightings in the S&P 500 index:\nStock\nVanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting\nS&P 500 Weighting\n1. Apple\n13.52%\n6.97%\n2. Microsoft\n12.68%\n6.54%\n3. Nvidia\n11.29%\n6.20%\n4. Meta Platforms\n4.96%\n2.41%\n5. Amazon\n4.54%\n3.45%\nData source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Aug. 31, and are subject to change.\nHaving a much higher weighting toward these stocks can be a double-edged sword. It means the Vanguard ETF will outperform the S&P 500 when those specific stocks are doing well, but it's likely to underperform if they hit a rough patch, because it lacks diversity relative to the index.\nWith that said, these five companies are among the most important players in the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Apple is rolling out its Apple Intelligence software, which it developed in partnership with OpenAI. It's going to transform the way iPhone, iPad, and Mac users create and consume content. Since Apple has over 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, the company could soon become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers.\nMicrosoft and Amazon have developed their own AI virtual assistants, which are embedded into their flagship software products. Plus, the Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services cloud platforms are two of the largest AI distribution channels for businesses, allowing them to access ready-made models and data center computing power for their development needs.\nNvidia's graphics processing chips (GPUs) for the data center are at the heart of the entire AI revolution. Its H100 GPU set the benchmark for AI developers last year, and the company is preparing to ship large volumes of its new Blackwell-based GPUs, which will deliver an incredible leap in performance and cost efficiency.\nOutside its top five positions, the Vanguard ETF also holds popular megacap stocks like Eli Lilly, Tesla, Costco Wholesale, and McDonald's -- so it isn't all about technology.\nThe Vanguard ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 13.1% since it was established in 2007, which is much better than the average annual return of 10.2% in the S&P 500.\nThe ETF has delivered an even stronger compound annual return of 20.2% over the last five years. That's because of the rapid adoption of technologies like cloud computing and AI, which have propelled stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon to multitrillion-dollar valuations. The S&P 500 has gained 16.7% per year (on average) over that same stretch.\nIn other words, if technology stocks continue to lead the broader market higher, investors should expect the Vanguard ETF to outperform the S&P 500 because of its enormous exposure to the sector. Some forecasts on Wall Street suggest AI could add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy over the next decade. If that's true, tech stocks will be one of the best places to invest.\nConversely, if AI fails to live up to the hype, the Vanguard ETF could underperform for a period of time because stocks like Nvidia would lose a chunk of the value they have created over the last couple of years.\nThis Vanguard ETF is very cheap to own, with an expense ratio of just 0.07% (the portion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs), which is more than 90% cheaper than comparable funds, according to Vanguard. Therefore, investors seeking exposure to the big end of the stock market without having to pick individual winners and losers should look no further.\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Each of the six publicly traded companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion has played a significant role in the advancement and development of artificial intelligence (AI). Four of them have split their stocks in the last five years.\nIt might not be long before another AI stock-split stock joins the ranks. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has emerged as a key supplier of AI data-center chip designs, complementing its other semiconductor designs and enterprise-software business.\nWith its market capitalization around $850 billion, as of this writing, Broadcom needs to gain 18% to reach the $1 trillion milestone. Here's why it's bound to get there.\nBroadcom's roots are in semiconductor design, and it has developed a strong portfolio of intellectual property that has served it well in the AI arms race among big tech companies.\nBroadcom's networking chips are essential infrastructure for AI data centers. While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) get all the headlines, it's Broadcom's chips that allow a company to get the most out of the billions of dollars it is spending on those GPUs. Broadcom's networking chips ensure data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another, improving the efficiency of the data center. No company can compete with Broadcom's technology in this arena, and few customers would risk switching to a competitor due to the potential impact of using an inferior chip design and other switching costs.\nBroadcom also has a growing custom chip-design business fueled by AI spending. Broadcom designs Alphabet's tensor processing unit (TPU), which Apple used to train its Apple Intelligence large language model (LLM). It's also behind Meta's MTIA chips, which help train and run Meta's Llama model. Generative AI leader, OpenAI, is reportedly working with Broadcom for its own custom-chip designs as well.\nBroadcom isn't just an AI chipmaker, though. It holds a dominant position in wireless phone chips that improve 5G reception while extending battery life. It also makes WiFi and Bluetooth chips. Its chips are found in Apple's iPhone as well as in many other high-end smartphones.\nBroadcom has also made strategic acquisitions of enterprise software providers over the last few years, including Symantec and VMWare. It uses a land-and-expand strategy focused on selling multiple software solutions to a small group of large enterprise customers. That provides a growing and very sticky source of recurring revenue.\nBroadcom's networking chips are already essential infrastructure for AI. Over the next few years, more and more big tech companies will likely come to rely on its custom AI accelerators as well. Google and Meta are already spending heavily on custom silicon designed by Broadcom.\nAs AI development matures, investors can expect a greater focus on custom-chip designs like Google and Meta's. That's because these chips can be less expensive than general-purpose GPUs, and they use less energy for the same tasks. As a result, I expect them to account for a growing share of silicon in AI data centers.\nBroadcom's AI chips business is still a small piece of its operations, but it's growing extremely quickly. Its ethernet switching-chip sales grew more than 4x year over year in the third quarter, and AI accelerator sales grew 3.5x year over year. Both should continue to drive strong results for Broadcom into the future.\nBroadcom's stock currently trades for about 29.5 times earnings estimates for 2025.\nBroadcom should see improved earnings performance next year as it trims excess operating expenses related to its acquisition of VMWare in late 2023. Those trims should result in strong operating margin expansion. Even better, the long-term potential for operating leverage remains high even as its AI chips business scales and it builds its recurring revenue enterprise software business. Over time, Broadcom should see earnings growth outpace revenue growth.\nAI chips could drive extremely strong revenue growth over the next few years. And with improved operating leverage, it should produce the earnings growth needed to justify its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nIn order to reach a $1 trillion valuation, Broadcom stock will have to reach a share price of about $214. That would put its valuation at roughly the same 29 times forward P/E at the end of next year based on current analysts' estimates. If Broadcom can outperform expectations, it might reach the $1 trillion milestone even sooner.\nBased on its current price and the current outlook for the business, it looks like the stock trades for fair value and could be worth a spot in your portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's amazing how much things can change in just 20 years. Two decades ago, industrial and energy stalwarts General Electric and ExxonMobil were the most valuable companies when measured by market cap, worth $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Jump ahead to 2024, and technology concerns are leading the way.\nTopping the list are three of the world's most recognizable tech companies. Apple leads the pack at $3.4 trillion (as of this writing). Nvidia and Microsoft are trailing close behind, with market caps of $3.1 trillion and $3 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $1.9 trillion, it might seem premature to suggest that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has all the attributes necessary for membership in the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 42% over the past year and 109% over the past five years, and its rebound appears poised to continue.\nRecent improvements in the economy, the company's strong market position, and its measured adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) could be the drivers needed to fuel Amazon's membership in this elite fraternity.\nThe past several years have been rife with challenges, not the least of which was an economic downturn fueled by decades-high inflation. There's been a vast improvement in recent months, however, as consumer sentiment in September reached its highest point in five months and the Federal Reserve Bank began its long-awaited campaign of interest rate cuts.\nThe improving economic conditions are favorably impacting Amazon's results. In the second quarter, net sales of $148 billion climbed 10% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26 nearly doubled.\nHelping fuel the robust results were improvements from each of the company's major operating segments. Online sales in the U.S. increased 9%, while international sales climbed 7%. Perhaps most important was a reacceleration from Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- the company's cloud computing business -- which jumped 19%, its highest rate of growth since late 2022.\nEqually important is advertising -- the company's fastest-growing business -- which increased 20%, as Amazon is working to become a major player in the ad world.\nAmazon is the undisputed leader in the realm of e-commerce, which is an area it pioneered. The company accounted for 38% of U.S. digital retail sales last year, more than its next 15 largest rivals combined, according to data compiled by eMarketer. That dominance is expected to continue in 2024, with the company expected to nab 40% of online sales in the U.S. this year.\nThe company has long employed AI to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals. Amazon uses AI to make product recommendations to customers and predict and maintain adequate inventory levels at its distribution centers and warehouses. The company also uses AI-powered robots to stock shelves and gather merchandise for shipping, and deploys these advanced algorithms to determine the most efficient delivery routes.\nAmazon is also the leader in cloud computing, another business it pioneered. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top provider of cloud infrastructure services, with 33% of the market in the second quarter, with Microsoft Azure at No. 2 and Alphabet's Google Cloud at No. 3, with 20% and 10% of the market respectively, according to research firm Canalys. Amazon offers one of the largest repositories of AI models for its cloud customers, which has helped reaccelerate its cloud growth.\nLast but certainly not least is Amazon's digital advertising business. The company displays ads on its e-commerce website, Prime Video, Freevee, Amazon Music streaming services, its Twitch video game streaming platform, and more. The company uses AI to help ensure the advertising reaches its target market. The results are undeniable, as advertising has been Amazon's fastest-growing business for several years running.\nAmazon currently boasts a market cap of roughly $1.9 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 57% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $635 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would have to grow its revenue to roughly $998 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Amazon of 11% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. It's worth noting that Amazon has grown its annual revenue by nearly 400% over the past decade, so those expectations could well be conservative.\nFurthermore, Amazon is currently selling for roughly 3.2 times sales, a slight discount compared to its average multiple of more than 3.3 over the past five years. That's a pretty attractive price to pay for a company with so many ways to win.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It was a mere 20 years ago that industrial and energy titans General Electric and ExxonMobil\u00a0were the world's most valuable companies when measured by market cap, with values of $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just two decades later, technology interests lead the field.\nHeading up the list are some of the world's most familiar technology names. Apple tops the charts at $3.5 trillion (as of this writing). Nvidia and Microsoft are trailing close behind, with market caps of $3.2 trillion and $3.1 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $2 trillion, it might seem a bit early to suggest that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has the makings for membership in the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 88% since early last year and 172% over the past five years, and there's every reason to believe its ascent will continue.\nA combination of an improving economy, Alphabet's market strength, and gains in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could provide the boost the company needs to join this exclusive society.\nThe widespread challenges of the past few years have been glaringly obvious, marked by macroeconomic headwinds and the worst inflation rates since the early 1980s. These conditions weighed heavily on each of Alphabet's major business segments and the stock plunged as much as 44% in response.\nHowever, there's been a marked improvement in recent months. In September, the Federal Reserve Bank cut interest rates for the first time since March 2020, and consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in months.\nThe economic rebound has had a dramatic effect on Alphabet's results. In the second quarter, revenue of $84.7 billion climbed 14% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.89 jumped 31%.\nEach of the company's major operating segments did their part to boost the results. The rebound in advertising, which has suffered the most in recent years, had the most profound impact. Google advertising, which provides the bulk of Alphabet's revenue, climbed 11% year over year, while Google Cloud -- the company's fastest-growing segment -- jumped 29%.\nGoogle has long been the undisputed leader in search, recently capturing 90% of the search market, according to internet statistics aggregator StatCounter. The company has worked to consistently improve its search acumen and the underlying algorithms, becoming something of an AI subject matter expert along the way.\nIt's also the undisputed leader in digital advertising, fueled primarily by Google Search and YouTube but also by its suite of products that count billions of users each. In 2023, Google captured an estimated 39% of worldwide digital advertising revenue, according to data compiled by Statista. For context, its closest competitor -- Meta Platforms -- garnered just 18%. This dominance is expected to continue.\nAlphabet is also a strong contender in the realm of cloud computing. Google Cloud is part of the \"Big Three\" as the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure services. The company controlled roughly 10% of the market in the second quarter, according to data supplied by Canalys. It was also the fastest-growing, with year-over-year revenue growth of 30%.\nHelping fuel demand for Google Cloud is the company's generative AI offerings. Alphabet has been using AI for years to inform its search results, and the company has refocused that expertise to fuel a suite of AI-powered models led by Gemini, one of the leading foundational AI models in the world. This is attracting new users to Google Cloud.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't address the elephant in the room. The antitrust case against Alphabet is one step closer to completion. The court found that Google had violated antitrust law, and the U.S. Justice Department is mulling recommendations regarding the appropriate remedies, though the judge will have the final say. One of the potential outcomes is a breakup of the company, which is something that hasn't happened in decades. There are other less severe proposals, like sharing Google's search code with rivals, blocking other providers from paying Google to be its default search engine and more.\nA final decision won't be reached for at least a year, and if Alphabet appeals (it says it will), the case could go on for several more. Wall Street hates uncertainty, so this has been an overhang for Alphabet stock in recent months.\nAll that aside, even if Alphabet were to be broken up -- and I don't believe it will -- that could unlock additional value, enriching shareholders along the way. So, the current concerns are merely noise, in my opinion.\nAlphabet currently boasts a market cap of roughly $2 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of about 47% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Alphabet is expected to generate revenue of $347.4 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Alphabet would have to grow its revenue to roughly $510 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Alphabet of about 11% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as early as 2028. It's worth noting that Alphabet has grown its annual revenue by 368% over the past decade, so Wall Street could be lowballing its forecast.\nFurthermore, Alphabet is currently selling for roughly 24 times earnings, a significant discount compared to the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. The aforementioned uncertainty is providing a very attractive entry point for savvy investors who plan to buy and hold for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Editor\u2019s note: Tonight, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is set to reveal the biggest launch of his career at the company\u2019s \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event: the Robotaxi. My InvestorPlace colleague\u00a0Luke Lango\u00a0says that Musk\u2019s event will be the tipping point for robotaxis and other AVs to go mainstream in 2025.\nAs he explained in a special briefing earlier this week, autonomous driving is already becoming a reality. (And he even has the video of his own experience to prove it.)\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nToday, Luke is joining us to explain how you can profit from this AV Revolution. He has identified a little-known robotaxi supplier that he believes could play a key role in the Tesla\u2019s Cybercab\u2026 and potentially make investors a lot of money along the way.\nTake it away\u2026\nWhen Steve Jobs leapfrogged the entire computer industry to make Apple Inc. (AAPL), he managed to turn science fiction into reality. Eventually, Apple became one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies\u2026\nBecause out-of-the-box computing was still more sci-fi than reality, there was NO market for personal computers when Apple\u2019s early dynamic duo \u2014 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak \u2014 set about to build the Apple I.\nThe pair created the market.\nBoth Jobs and Wozniak invented the Apple I for one simple reason \u2014 because they wanted a personal-use computer and the options at the time were impractical.\nIn the mid-1960s, roughly half of all the world\u2019s computers were IBM 1401s, which replaced bulky vacuum tubes with transistors. The 1401 was considered the Model T of computers because it sold well (for the time), producing 12,000 units and making the case for the computer as a general-purpose (as opposed to hobbyist) machine.\nHowever, the 1401 weighed about five tons all-in. It\u2019s not exactly something Jobs and Woz could lug around to their friends\u2019 houses.\nThen there was the Altair 8800, a DIY computer popular among hobbyists. In fact, it was the Altair from which Jobs and Woz drew inspiration for the Apple I.\nTheir desire to build a computer that could make life easier for everyone led to the Apple II, the first true PC designed for consumers.\nRather than weighing a literal ton or being packaged as a single board meant to be installed by folks with the know-how, the Apple II resembled an ordinary home appliance:\nRight out of the box, ordinary folks without strong technical knowledge, could be up and running in relatively little time.\nIt was the world\u2019s first truly customer-friendly, pre-assembled computer for the masses, and it set the stage for the computer industry to this day.\nHere\u2019s Steve Wozniak reflecting on his time at Apple:\nEvery single Apple project \u2013 computers, hard disks, everything \u2013 I had never designed those things ever in my life\u2026 I had no training in them, but I was so good at taking the little parts \u2013 like pieces of wood to build a building \u2013 that I could architect something that was perfect. And really better than the people that were used to doing it would do.\nWoz isn\u2019t bragging here. He\u2019s making an important point\u2026\nWhile education and training are important, nothing is a substitute for unbridled creativity and innovation.\nHere\u2019s Woz again:\nA person who knows how to take the little elements and build on them, and write the book of how you actually put them into play, a person who comes up with the ability to write the book, I think is better than someone who knows how to do it from past experience.\nI bring this up because, right now,the world\u2019s most powerful companies are racing to develop top-tier artificial intelligence.\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and others have invested billions in AI technologies.\nSo far, they\u2019ve mainly followed the established practice laid out by OpenAI\u2026\nBut there\u2019s one company with foresight, patience, and commitment to innovation that could do for AI that Apple did for computing\u2026\nYou see, in just a few short days, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man \u2014 will unveil a new AI-powered product that some believe could be as impactful as the iPhone, the Model 3, or the first PC.\nIt\u2019s called the Robotaxi. And it promises to shock the world.\nReportedly, the vehicle will be a fully self-driving car, without any steering wheel or pedals. Early descriptions reveal that it\u2019s likely to comprise a two-seat interior with a large center console. Musk says it will also have the lowest cost-per-mile of any transportation option.\nAnd supposedly, it will be accompanied by its own ride-hailing app (just like Uber), allowing customers to fetch autonomous rides in the Robotaxi at the push of a button.\nNow, if that all sounds like science fiction, that\u2019s because it was born of it.\nBut that\u2019s what Elon Musk could do at his \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event later this evening. That\u2019s when he is expected to reveal the Robotaxi. He could turn science fiction into reality. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting about this upcoming debut.\nIt echoes Woz\u2019s belief that those who \u201cwrite the book\u201d on new technologies are ultimately more valuable than those who follow established practices.\nAnd as we\u2019ve outlined above, that\u2019s when the magic happens.\u00a0\nThink about it\u2026 A mobile telephone that put the power of the internet into the palms of our hands, keeping us connected to everything anywhere we go? That surely sounded like science fiction back in the mid-2000s. Yet, Apple made it a reality with the iPhone \u2013 and in so doing, created a transformational product that fundamentally changed the world.\nWhen science fiction turns into reality, a sort of magic happens. The world is forever changed. And savvy investors are offered the opportunity to make potential fortunes.\nElon Musk could do just that at the \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event later this evening, around 10 p.m. Eastern.\nIn so doing, he will bring much-needed publicity to all the exciting developments happening in the world of autonomous vehicles (AVs) right now.\nAnd that, my friends, could push a flood of money into AV stocks.\nThe question is: When a revolutionary new product launches, what\u2019s the best way to invest in its success?\nBy buying shares of the company that created it, right?\nMaybe not.\u00a0\nJust consider: Ever since Apple launched the first iPhone in June 2007, Apple stock has taken off like a rocket ship. It has risen more than 6,000% in value since that time. But do you know which stock the iPhone propelled even higher? Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) \u2013 an important Apple supplier. Its stock is up more than 16,000% since the first iPhone\u2019s launch:\nAnother great example is Tesla\u2019s Model 3. Many consider it to be the most transformational electric vehicle (EV) \u2013 the car that really brought EVs to the mainstream. And, indeed, ever since its launch in July 2017, Tesla stock has absolutely soared, climbing about 1,500% higher.\nBut to create such a world-changing new product, Tesla was using chips from another company, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), to power the Model 3\u2019s unique Autopilot technology. And guess what? NVIDIA stock is up around 14,000% since that vehicle\u2019s debut.\nYou get the point. Sometimes, the best way to play a revolutionary new product launch is not to buy the stock of the headline company making the product.\nOften, it\u2019s the suppliers that outperform.\nAnd that\u2019s why I want to turn your attention to the next batch of potential superstar supplier stocks.\nOf course, if Robotaxi scales into a world-changing product over the next few years, TSLA stock will soar. But history suggests that certain supplier stocks could rise even more.\nTo prepare for this potential watershed moment, I just held a special briefing to discuss important developments in the autonomous vehicle industry, the Robotaxi launch and unveiled a playbook of what I believe are some of the best AV tech supplier stocks to buy now.\nThis event is centered around Robotaxi\u2019s launch, but it\u2019s about much more than that. It focuses on the groundbreaking autonomous vehicle revolution and, more importantly, how to potentially profit from it.\nThe event is tonight, which means that time is running out to join me in preparing for this new era of transportation. Our offer ends tonight, so there\u2019s only a few hours left to get in on it.\nLet\u2019s make this launch work for us.\nRegards,\nLuke Lango\nEditor, Hypergrowth Investing\nThe post Invest in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Apple II Moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for Autonomous Vehicles appeared first on InvestorPlace.\n"

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2347643/the-cheapest-mag-7-stocks-in-2024\nWelcome to Episode #385 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\u00a0\n(0:30) - Can You Find Value Within The Magnificent 7?\n(6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar?\n(28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA\n Podcast@Zacks.com\n\u00a0\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\nIt\u2019s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn\u2019t mean that investor doesn\u2019t want attractive valuations. A \u201ccheap\u201d stock, for value investors, doesn\u2019t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company\u2019s valuations are attractive.\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\nBut there\u2019s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n1. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\nBut the sell-off doesn\u2019t mean Tesla is cheap. It\u2019s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That\u2019s not cheap but at least it\u2019s under 10.\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it\u2019s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\nBut it is Amazon\u2019s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\nShould Amazon be on a value investor\u2019s short list?\n3. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\nNVIDIA can\u2019t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of \u201cjust\u201d 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n4. Apple Inc. AAPL\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\nBut Apple isn\u2019t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. META\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\nIt\u2019s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it\u2019s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Ireland on Tuesday unveiled a 2025 budget that includes tax cuts and increased social benefits, and announced a huge surplus in 2024 thanks to billions of euros in Apple back-taxes.\nMinister of Finance Jack Chambers announced a 10.5-billion-euro ($11.6-billion) 2025 budget package, which included higher public infrastructure investment and social welfare support.\nThe moves come with a general election looming: Prime minister Simon Harris must go to the country before March 2025.\nBut with poll ratings up for his coalition government, some suggest he could call the vote sooner.\n\"Budget 2025 puts the country on a firm footing for the future,\" Chambers told parliament.\nMeasures announced include extra child benefit payments before the end of the year, a universal electricity credit, increased welfare and pension payments, and a rise in rent tax credit.\nIreland is forecasting its fourth consecutive budget surplus in 2025, with 9.7 billion euros, faring much better than many other European countries thanks to its hefty corporate tax intake from multinational companies based in Dublin.\nThe state's 2024 finances have been boosted by 14 billion euros in back-taxes from Apple, after the European Court of Justice ruled in September that the iPhone maker benefited from undue tax advantages in the country. \nIreland is now left with a one-off revenue that Chambers said had the capacity to be \"transformational\".\nThe government intends to use the money to invest in \"housing, energy, water and transport infrastructure\", Chambers told parliament, adding that the full framework for its use will be revealed in the first quarter of next year.\n\"We know that our public finances are heavily reliant on corporation tax,\" Chambers said, before noting that the government should avoid using these \"potentially transient receipts to fund permanent expenditure measures\".\nWithout windfall taxes and \"one-off revenue\" from tech giants, the country would be in a deficit of 6.3 billion euros this year and 5.7 billion euros next year, according to the government.\najb/phz/bc\n"

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with APLE.\nRelease Date: August 06, 2024\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\nApple Hospitality REIT Inc (NYSE:APLE) achieved a portfolio occupancy of 80% in the second quarter, with a 2% year-over-year increase in Comparable Hotels occupancy.\nThe company reported a 2.5% growth in Comparable Hotels RevPAR for the quarter, with ADR slightly up year over year.\nAdjusted EBITDAre for the second quarter was $141 million, up 9% compared to the same period in 2023.\nApple Hospitality REIT Inc (NYSE:APLE) continues to provide an attractive dividend yield, with a $0.24 per common share distribution during the quarter.\nThe company successfully repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at an average price of $14.29 per share, indicating confidence in its stock value.\nComparable Hotels adjusted hotel EBITDA margin declined by 50 basis points year over year to 39%.\nThere is increased price sensitivity among leisure consumers, impacting ADR growth.\nThe company revised its full-year 2024 guidance, decreasing net income and adjusted EBITDAre expectations.\nMidweek business travel demand is recovering slower than anticipated, affecting overall rate growth.\nThe ongoing legal dispute with LuxUrban regarding a New York property could impact future financial performance.\nQ: In June, you mentioned the expectation that business transient versus leisure rates should eventually return to a more normalized spread. Where are you now versus 2019, and what's your expectation for that spread in the second half of the year? A: We are still meaningfully behind that spread relative to 2019. We had seen a complete reversal in trends where we had been maybe 800 basis points higher midweek than we were on weekends post-pandemic. That switched and flip-flopped. We're shrinking the gap, but not as quickly as we'd like. As leisure price sensitivity continues, that gap can shrink that way too, which obviously would not be preferable. But we still have upside relative to the pre-pandemic spread between midweek and weekend occupancy rates.\nQ: Based on your new guidance, would you need to or potentially choose to change your dividends on the current $0.08 monthly level? A: No. We have more than adequate coverage given what we've anticipated for the remainder of the year.\nQ: Are there potential acquisitions you may be close on but have paused progress on just given where your stock is trading? A: We are underwriting as many deals as we ever have. A significant number of those deals meet our investment criteria in terms of strategic fit. We take into consideration where we're trading as we price those assets. Most sellers are choosing to hold assets rather than adjust pricing. Unless we see a meaningful shift in our overall cost of capital, it's unlikely that you would see us become more aggressive on the acquisitions front.\nQ: What do you think needs to happen for you to see some additional rate upside or shift in the mix of corporate accounts to drive that midweek ADR? A: We continue to feel reasonably good about booking pace. Assuming we are able to continue to grow occupancy, we would anticipate being in a better position to move rate, especially mid-week. A portion of our corporate accounts are on fixed price contracts, which tend to renew on an annual basis. With higher occupancy, we see ourselves in a better position to negotiate favorable pricing.\nQ: Can you talk about the weakness you're seeing on the lower end customer at the lower scale and if it's working up the chain scale? A: Most of what you're seeing in our portfolio is more market driven than asset category driven. While we've heard of weakness with lower end customers, we have not generally seen that trend absent pairing it with performance of individual markets. When we look at weaker markets in our portfolio, there's a reasonable mix of assets at both ends.\nQ: How does the monthly performance compare to your initial expectations for the quarter, and what are your thoughts going forward in terms of holding RevPAR flat for the second half of the year? A: We assumed consistent performance month to month throughout the quarter. We started to see an unanticipated pullback from a leisure rate perspective. Occupancy held in, but we continued to see degradation from a rate perspective. The price sensitivity from the leisure consumer wasn't originally banked into our guidance.\nQ: Can you drill down a little more on the weekday mix of business? Are any business groups swapping out for the other? A: We saw meaningful improvement in small and medium-sized business travel, which has continued. We've seen improvement in corporate travel as well. The growth midweek was a mix of small, medium-sized business and larger corporate accounts. The trend has stayed relatively consistent.\nQ: Are you still seeing opportunities for takeouts of new construction at fixed pricing, and are developers jacking up the price? A: Construction costs increased meaningfully during the pandemic, further exacerbated by increases in borrowing costs. We're challenged to find deals that work for us and developers. We'll be selective in signing up future development deals. A significant portion of our focus has been on acquiring existing assets where we've achieved strong yields.\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"
