        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 18 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nGrowth investors have been piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months as a variety of factors, including rapid technological advancements, soaring investment, and widespread adoption across sectors drive interest towards the AI business. Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Ahead of the launch event of the new iPhone, reports indicate that the company has placed orders for the assembly of around 90 million units of the new phone, ten million more than last year. The increase in orders might stem from the expected growth in sales for these phones that will be shipped with Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that Apple has been aggressively marketing over the past few months. Experts, like Dan Loeb of Third Point, believe the new AI features will lead to stronger up cycles for new launches. Apple Intelligence features are not compatible with older phones and might compel customers to faster upgrades.\nWall Street analysts have also weighed in on these developments regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For example, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $273. In a recent investor note, the analyst highlighted that Apple Intelligence remained the key to unlocking pent up iPhone demand and accelerating the replacement cycle. The analyst expects the launch event to heavily feature AI integration on the new iPhone 16.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall maintained Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Buy and raised the price target from\u00a0$265\u00a0to\u00a0$275.\nThe analyst said Apple should be on the cusp of a multi-year replacement cycle for the iPhone after the iPhone maker delivered a solid third-quarter iPhone-driven EPS beat with continued services momentum.\nThe analyst noted that iPhone revenue of $39.3 billion beat the consensus of $38.6 billion, growing ~2% ex-forex (-1% year-on-year). Apple ended the quarter with channel inventory at the low end of its target range for iPhone and iPad, Hall highlighted.\nAlso, iPad and Mac revenue beat consensus revenue, reflecting new product launch benefits, with the latest iPads and Mac in the quarter all capable of supporting Apple Intelligence.\nHall highlighted Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue guidance for 5% Y/Y, including service revenue growth of 13% Y/Y, which implies 2% Y/Y product revenue growth.\nApple\u2019s reminders about tough comparisons on Mac (Y/Y comps), Wearables (Y/Y comps), and iPad (Q/Q comps) imply that iPhone revenue should grow Y/Y in the fourth quarter, indicating strong demand, as per the analyst.\nHe said that Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter gross margin guidance of 45.5%-46.5% (versus consensus of 45.7%) would mark a fourth-quarter record, even at the low end.\nThe fourth-quarter gross margin outlook supports the analyst\u2019s view that iPhone revenue in the September quarter should be substantial given that the iPhone has the highest margins in the products portfolio, providing mix benefits and that the recent services gross margin expansion to the mid-70% range is durable.\nHall projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.54 billion and $1.60.\nKeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel reiterated a Sector Weight rating on Apple.\nThe re-rating reflected the third-quarter results that came in better than expectations, but guidance aligned with expectations.\nNispel said Apple outperformed expectations across all product categories, ex Mac, and beat on services.\nWhile the guide is cryptic, he noted it implies iPhone +~3% Y/Y.\nBased on his conversations with carriers, Nispel remained skeptical of a significant acceleration in the upgrade cycle and noted a much more gradual replacement rate than the bulls.\nNispel\u2019s model continues to call for less growth than consensus, and he continues to see upgrade rate pressures and China competition, which limits his enthusiasm for Apple.\nNispel projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.10 billion and $1.58.\nPiper Sandler analyst Matt Farrell reiterated a Neutral rating on Apple with a $225 price target.\nApple delivered June quarter results slightly ahead of expectations, mainly due to strong growth in iPad and services, Farrell noted.\nThe analyst flagged that iPhone revenue was down 1% Y/Y in the June quarter despite the install base hitting new all-time highs.\nIn addition, Greater China\u2019s revenue showed further improvement in the June quarter. Farrell said investors remain laser-focused on the second half of the iPhone ramp.\nStill, based on the September quarter commentary, the analyst\u2019s iPhone revenue estimates remain unchanged for the back half of the calendar year. Management is very excited about the Apple Intelligence opportunity.\nHowever, it will roll out in stages across the globe, and Farrell is still cautious about the consumer entering the second half. The analyst continues to view shares as appropriately valued ahead of the upcoming iPhone 16 launch.\nFarrell projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.07 billion and $1.58.\nBofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on Apple with a price target of $256.\nThe re-rating reflected the expected strong iPhone upgrade cycle in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, higher growth in services revenue, higher margins from more internally developed silicon, continuing capital returns, and AI features that can drive higher institutional ownership.\nAccording to Mohan, results from Apple indicate improving trends across the portfolio where growth accelerated in iPhone, iPad, and wearables and across regions.\nAs per the analyst, implied revenue guidance of $94 billion will be conservative, especially around services and iPhones. Mohan noted the potential for significant acceleration of units in the December quarter and overall in fiscal 2025 with the rollout of Apple Intelligence.\nMohan said there is potential for consensus estimates to be revised higher given the multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, tailwinds to gross margins, and strong cash flows.\nMohan projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.75 billion and $1.61.\nPrice Action: AAPL is up 3.08% at $225.08 at the last check on Friday.\nImage via Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nBarclays\nMaintains\nEqual-Weight\nFeb 2022\nTigress Financial\nMaintains\nStrong Buy\nJan 2022\nCredit Suisse\nMaintains\nNeutral\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Apple's Multi-Year iPhone Upgrade Cycle and AI Features To Drive Upside, Analysts Say originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Upwallstreet ",
        "Text": "On Thursday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its third quarter financials, revealing a YoY decline in iPhone sales and falling short of expectations in China.\nAlthough Apple CEO Tim Cook also acknowledged the rising costs of AI investments, the rise in Apple\u2019s capital expenditure is tiny compared to its mega-cap tech peers, such as\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and they are also growing at a much slower rate. When it comes to AI and a new era that is unfolding, Apple has a unique take on, as always.\nFor the quarter ended on June 29th, Apple reported revenue grew 5% YoY to $85.5 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$84.53 billion.\u00a0Revenue out of Greater China was $14.7 billion, a drop compared to last year\u2019s comparable quarter when the region brought in $15.2 billion.\u00a0Bloomberg were anticipating revenue of $15.2 billion.\u00a0iPhone remained the main revenue driver, making as much as 45% of total sales. But sales did slightly decline, more precisely 1% YoY to $39.2 billion, but still surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $38.81 billion. Services revenue that includes revenue from Google hit $24.2 billion as it grew 14% YoY and also topped LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of $24.01 billion.\niPad showed the strongest growth of almost 24% YoY as it brought in\u00a0$7.16 billion, topping LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of\u00a0\u00a0$6.61 billion estimated.\nWearables sales, however, declined to $8.1 billion\u00a0but still topped LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of\u00a0$7.79 billion\u00a0.\nMac revenue grew about 2% YoY to $7.01 billion\u00a0which came slightly short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$7.02 billion.\nAs for the bottom line, Apple posted a net income of\u00a0$21.45 billion and\u00a0\u00a0earnings per share of $1.40.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to play the game by increasing spending to avoid risking being left behind. With the AI spending spree, Zuckerberg also wants to ensure its big tech peers like Apple don\u2019t fully control the next tech era if it turns out to be AI. On the other hand, Apple is playing a different game.\u00a0Unlike Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Apple doesn\u2019t have a cloud business with which it rents out infrastructure to companies. Last week, Apple released the first version of its suite of AI features.\nIt plans to roll out its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence software to U.S. English users in the fall. Next year, it will \"proceed with more functionality, more features, and more languages and regions. The new software is expected to trigger a fresh iPhone sales supercycle and boost Apple\u2019s bottom line as\u00a0\u00a0the new software will only be compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and newer phones that will force iPhone owners of pre-15 models to upgrade if they want their hands on Apple\u2019s newest development.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Text": "By Supantha Mukherjee\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Apple will change how users choose browser options in the European Union, add a dedicated section for changing default apps, and make more apps deletable, the company said on Thursday.\nThe iPhone maker came under pressure from regulators to make changes after the EU's sweeping Digital Markets Act took effect on March 7, forcing it to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers on a \"choice screen\" the first time they open Safari.\nIn an update later this year, Apple users will be able to select a default browser directly from the choice screen after going through a mandatory list of options.\nA randomly ordered list of 12 browsers per EU country will be shown to the user with short descriptions, and the chosen one will be automatically downloaded, Apple said. The choice screen will also be available on iPads through an update later this year.\nApple released a previous update in response to the new rules in March, but browser companies criticized the design of its choice screen, and the Commission opened an investigation on March 25 saying it suspected that the measures fell short of effective compliance.\n\"We welcome Apple's updated choice screen, particularly as it precedes the upcoming iPhone launches,\" Andrew Frost Moroz, founder of Aloha browser, told Reuters.\n\"For those less familiar with us, the description will highlight these benefits, and fewer taps to start browsing will enhance the user experience and benefit third-party browsers,\" he said.\nApple said it has been in dialogue with the European Commission and believes the new changes will address regulators' concerns.\nThe Commission said on Thursday it will monitor the effectiveness of the solutions in achieving the objective of the DMA and will decide on the next steps in the open case.\nIt also plans to introduce a dedicated area for default apps where a user will be able to set defaults for messaging, phone calls, spam filters, password managers and keyboards.\nUsers will also be able to delete certain Apple-made apps such as App Store, Messages, Camera, Photos and Safari. Only Settings and Phone apps would not be deletable.\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Jan Harvey and Aurora Ellis)\n"

As a result, index providers calculated the tech company\u2019s weight based on a methodology known as float-adjusted market capitalization.\nPut simply, Apple\u2019s true value is not reflected in many indexes.\nIn percentage terms, the numbers don\u2019t seem huge \u2014 in the case of the S&P 500, for instance, 94% of Apple\u2019s value is currently considered. That should now increase to 100%, according to Piper Sandler & Co. But in a $3 trillion company, it adds up.\nIn the wake of Berkshire\u2019s sale, passive funds tracking these indexes may now have to buy as much as $40 billion of Apple stock when they next rebalance, according to Piper Sandler\u2019s estimates. That\u2019s triple the average daily trading volume of the company\u2019s shares over the past month.\nIndex funds robotically stepping-in to replace another investor in one of the megacaps will offer ammunition to critics like David Einhorn, who argue passive investing has \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d the markets by making so much money value-insensitive. More immediately, it\u2019s bad news for some other companies in the gauges, whose weights will be reduced to accommodate the change and whose shares will be sold by funds accordingly.\nThe first revisions won\u2019t take place until the quarterly index rebalance due next month, and for now at least any shuffling looks secondary for a market that\u2019s fixated on economic growth and central bank policies. But there is a cohort of traders who take positions in anticipation of events like this.\n\u201cWe often see activity due to rebalances on our desk,\u201d said Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler\u2019s chief investment strategist. \u201cPeople want to be aware of it.\u201d\nA spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices referred Bloomberg News to its index methodology and declined to comment further.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nNew Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas)\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.52 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $93.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $390.21 billion and $421.35 billion estimates indicate +1.8% and +8% changes, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "It's hard to believe that Apple ($AAPL) once had to be rescued by Microsoft. Today, Apple is the largest company in the world by market cap, worth over $3 trillion.\nApple is a technology company based out of Cupertino, California. From its founding, Apple has been known for its signature approach of integrated hardware-software design. Every device that Apple makes is built around a proprietary operating system, typically either the Mac OS or the iOS.\nThis is central to the company's business model. Developing its own hardware and software gives Apple a degree of control effectively unique in the device industry, which has led to the company's reputation for reliable, powerful machines. However, this approach also contributes to high costs and low interoperability. Here's what you should know about the history of Apple.\nFor news that may impact Apple and other potential investments delivered right to your inbox, sign up for the Market Minute newsletter.\nThe tech industry has a deep image of founders starting from their garage and making billions. This is rooted in reality. Several globe-spanning firms began exactly that way, including Apple Computers. Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched the company in 1976. Both were in their 20s working out of Jobs' family garage and funded their startup by selling personal possessions.\nApple built its first product in 1977, and in those early days introduced several innovations that would come to define the computer industry. This included the disk drive, which made storing and moving information far more convenient, and user design, which emphasized making the product more accessible for general users. Initially Apple was mainly an institutional success, with customers in the data and educational worlds particularly. Arguably Apple's most important early strategy was to market heavily to public schools. The company's marketing and its emphasis on user design made this a success, and established its brand widely with the general public through its presence in school computer labs.\nApple broke into the home computer market in 1984 with the release of the Macintosh computer.\nThe Macintosh featured the industry's first GUI, or \"graphical user interface,\" that allowed users to interact with the computer through a cursor and images rather than typing commands at a command prompt. It debuted with a particularly famous commercial \"1984\" in which Apple portrayed itself as rebelling against conformity and dystopia, an image that competitors would take advantage of in targeted ads against Apple 40 years later.\nBy 1985 both Jobs and Wozniak had left the company. Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s Apple gradually lost market share to what became known as the \"PC\" market. This was defined by competitor Microsoft's Windows operating system, a GUI largely modeled after Apple's own MacOS.\nMicrosoft licensed Windows widely, allowing any manufacturer to run the OS on their computers, which in turn led to significantly lower prices and broader adoption. This process accelerated significantly with the success of Microsoft's Windows 3.1, released in 1990. It would culminate in 1997, when Microsoft famously bailed out a struggling Apple and Jobs returned as CEO.\u00a0What was in it for Microsoft? Apple promised to include Microsoft Office on Macs.\nAfter 1997, Apple turned to a series of new innovations. They re-emphasized aesthetic design with the iMac series, and the success of this product moved the entire industry away from the traditional \"beige boxes.\" But the company's true modern identity arguably began with the 2001 release of iTunes and the iPod, a media-focused approach that continues to this day.\nIn 2007, Apple released the iPhone based on the iterated design of its iPod line of products (which in turn would eventually be discontinued in 2022).\u00a0The iPhone entered a market dominated by Blackberry, but its touch-screen design was a significant leap over Blackberry's models, and the legacy competitor would take years to catch up.\u00a0In the 2000s, Apple emphasized its design and ad campaigns to establish a new image.\nIn 2010, Apple again defined a new space with the iPad. This device arguably created the tablet market. Despite criticism that the iPad was, effectively, little more than a large iPhone, it became quickly successful. To this day, the iPad holds a larger market share than any other Apple product.\nIn 2018, Apple became the first public company valued at $1 trillion. Now, the company is valued at over $3 trillion.\nFor help determining if Apple is an appropriate investment for your portfolio, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you crunch the numbers.\nLike many large technology companies, Apple owns and operates a range of business and product lines. Among others, these include:\nRetail, through its Apple stores\nSoftware development\nDevices and peripherals\nTV and movies, through Apple+ and iTunes\nMusic, through iTunes\nSound engineering\nPublishing and podcasts\nCloud computing\nArtificial intelligence\nFinancial technology\nStill, it's fair to say that three main product lines dominate Apple's business model: the App Store, iOS devices and the Macintosh computer.\nApple's App Store is a successor to its iTunes Store. The latter began operating in 2003, on the heels of the then-urgent issue of music piracy and downloading. In the late 90s and early 2000s, software such as Napster and Limewire made it easy for users to illegally download media for free, and Apple began its per-track iTunes store in part as a response to that era.\nMeanwhile, the App Store has turned into one of the company's most important products. Launched in 2008, the App Store is a platform installed on all iOS and Macintosh devices that allows users to download software directly from Apple. While it is a secondary product on Apple's computers, it is the only way to download new software to the iPhone and iPad.\u00a0This has given the company a de facto gatekeeper role on these products that it does not enforce on Macintoshes which, in turn, has led to modern concerns over antitrust violations.\nAs it stands, however, that gatekeeper role has proven highly profitable for Apple. The company uses the App Store to distribute its own software and to facilitate transactions between third-party developers or advertisers and customers. While charges can vary, the company usually takes a 30% platform fee for all third-party transactions.\nGetting exact numbers on App Store revenue is difficult. This is in part because Apple's business lines are so integrated that it can be difficult to distinguish between revenue sources. For example, an estimate by Deepwater Asset Management suggests that the company earned approximately $27 billion in 2022 from software and ad sales through the App Store.\u00a0Another analysis published by CNBC suggests that Apple took in closer to $85 billion from App Store fees in that same year.\u00a0In all cases, however, the App Store is undeniably a large and growing part of Apple's overall revenues.\nThe term iOS devices refers to the iPhone and iPad, which run on Apple's proprietary iOS operating system. It is difficult to overstate how important these two devices, and particularly the iPhone, have become to Apple's business model. The iPhone alone, through sales, software and other revenue, accounts for more than 50% of the company's revenue.\u00a0The iPhone has roughly 28% of the overall smartphone market.\nIn a very real way, modern Apple is a phone company that also makes computers. Based on most published information, iPhone sales appear to generate around $180 billion to $200 billion per year for the company.\nSelling the iPhone is Apple's single biggest business, which has caused some concerns for the company in recent years. During the late 2000's and much of the 2010's, Apple could count on frequent upgrades from existing users as technology and features advanced significantly between models. However in recent years the iPhone has hit a plateau known as \"commodification,\" in which the phones become less a feat of engineering and more of an ordinary product. This has significantly downshifted upgrade sales to existing customers, who have begun getting longer life from their existing phones.\nSign up for the Market Minute newsletter for news that may affect Apple and the wider stock market.\nThe Macintosh computer is central to Apple's brand and history, and remains one of the company's core product lines. Today, these tend to come in two versions: high-powered desktop machines, typically associated with media creation, and more ubiquitous laptops, such as the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air, typically prized for their small size relative to capabilities.\nMacintosh computers are known for their design, reliability and performance, but the proprietary approach which allows that high-functionality also makes them more expensive with little software interoperability. Macs occupy about 15% of the computer market share.\nDespite the company's legacy as a computer maker, today Macintosh sales only make up about 8% of Apple's overall revenue.\u00a0In Q1 2024, this division brought in about $7.45 billion, and many analysts expect that to decline further. What is less clear is what drives these numbers. The computing market continues to diversify, as users spread more of their activity across phones, tablets and other devices. It is not entirely certain whether Mac sales represent a change in Apple's fortunes or a redistribution across the entire industry, as users who would otherwise have bought a computer now buy a tablet or a high-end phone.\nApple is led by CEO Tim Cook, a longtime computer industry executive.\u00a0The company's leadership team also includes:\nTim Cook \u2013 Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\nJeff Williams \u2013 Chief Operating Officer (COO)\nLuca Maestri \u2013 Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\nKatherine Adams \u2013 Senior Vice President and General Counsel\nEddy Cue \u2013 Senior Vice President of Services\nCraig Federighi \u2013 Senior Vice President of Software Engineering\nJohn Giannandrea \u2013 Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy\nGreg \"Joz\" Joswiak \u2013 Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing\nSabih Khan \u2013 Senior Vice President of Operations\nDeirdre O'Brien \u2013 Senior Vice President of Retail\nJohny Srouji \u2013 Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies\nJohn Ternus \u2013 Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering\nApple\u2019s leadership page lists more of the team.\nApple IPO\u2019ed under the ticker $AAPL December 12, 1980. It has since undergone five stock splits:\nJune 16, 1987 \u2013 2-for-1 Split\nJune 21, 2000 \u2013 2-for-1 Split\nFebruary 28, 2005 \u2013 2-for-1 Split\nJune 9, 2014 \u2013 7-for-1 Split\nAugust 31, 2020 \u2013 4-for-1 Split\nSign up for the Market Minute newsletter to stay up to date on news affecting Apple and other potential investments.\nApple is one of the most profitable, successful technology companies in the world. Unlike many firms operating in this space, the company does not tend to rely on outside funding, debt, taxes or other financial mechanics to generate its outsized profits. Instead, most of its money comes from direct consumer/client-based revenue. This gives Apple a more steady and, arguably, stable financial base.\nHowever, it has also made the company vulnerable in a few key ways. Two important issues to pay attention to with Apple are antitrust and innovation.\nIn recent years, Apple has come under increasing scrutiny for potential monopolistic practices in the smartphone market. In early lawsuits the company has had real, but mixed, success defending itself, but at time of writing the trend of criticism and the risks of antitrust enforcement appear to be growing.\nAt the same time, Apple has been criticized for having an innovation problem. Despite high-budget advertising campaigns to brand new products like the Apple Watch and ApplePay, the company's last two industry-defining products were the iPhone and iPad. It has been 14 years since the company had a true breakout success, and many analysts agree that both of these product lines have hit a development plateau. This intersects with the company's antitrust problems, as growing dissatisfaction with some of Apple's latest iOS designs have led more users to complain about using Apple's products through lock-in than choice.\nConsider speaking with a financial advisor for professional advice about Apple\u2019s investment potential.\nApple is a technology hardware and software company based out of Cupertino, California. The company has operated since 1976. While it historically began making computers, today it is primarily a leader in the phone, tablet and device space, and is the largest company in the world by market cap.\nSay that it's 1977 and a long-haired engineer named Steve is showing off his latest invention. You wouldn't want to miss out on this, and you especially wouldn't want to be the unfortunate executive who sold his stake for $800. But how exactly should you value this startup opportunity?\nA financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nIn recent months, the AI industry has been presenting explosive opportunities in the development and deployment of AI infrastructure. Companies that provide AI chips, cloud services, and data storage solutions are poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities. For example, NVIDIA, a leading provider of AI chips, has seen the shares rally by 160% in 2024, driven by the increasing need for powerful processing capabilities in AI applications. Similarly, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are seeing a surge in demand for their AI and machine learning services, making them attractive options for investors.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHowever, in this buzz around the new tech, investors should also stop and consider some of the risks and challenges associated with AI. Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors.\nAnother critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive. The continuous advancements in AI technologies, coupled with their increasing integration into various sectors, provide a strong foundation for future growth.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

The stock has been hit in recent weeks after legendary investor Warren Buffett reduced his holdings in the company significantly during the second quarter of 2024. However, even as some take flight, others have been doubling down on their bets. For example, Third Point, a New York-based hedge fund led by Dan Loeb, recently revealed that it had bought nearly 550,000 shares in the tech giant. Loeb, in a letter to investors, highlighted his bullish views on the company in the field of artificial intelligence. Apple introduced Apple Intelligence earlier this year, a suite of software products designed to make Apple devices like iPhones AI capable.\nLoeb underlined that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) would drive meaningful new demand within the installed base with the release of AI features, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. He detailed that iPhone revenue was going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features would not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Furthermore, per Loeb, the App Store was likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer-focused AI apps.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The profit also topped analyst forecasts.\nApple's shares swung between slight increases and modest declines in Thursday's extended trading as investors assessed the results.\nSales of the iPhone \u2014 Apple\u2019s marquee product \u2014 remained on a downward slope though, dipping 1% from last year to $39.3 billon. That decrease wasn\u2019t as bad as the January-March period when iPhone sales plummeted 10% from last year, and now the product appears headed toward a major upswing.\nThat\u2019s because Apple is planning to roll out a variety of artificial intelligence features that are supposed to make its virtual assistant Siri smarter and also perform a variety of helpful and fun tasks, including helping to draft texts and even creating unique emojis on demand. The AI tools will be included in a free software update expected in the autumn, but most of the features will only work on iPhones with a special chip that so far has only been available on two premium models Apple released last year.\nThe next model, the iPhone 16, is expected to be equipped with the AI chip \u2014 a factor that analysts believe will spur consumers who have been holding on to their older devices to splurge on upgrades so they can take advantage of the new features. That expectation is the main reason why Apple\u2019s stock price has surged 13% since the company previewed its AI tools in early June \u2014 a run-up that has created about $400 billion in shareholder wealth so far.\n\u201cI believe it will be a very key time for a compelling upgrade cycle,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a Thursday conference call.\nApple\u2019s push into AI may also fuel its steadily growing services division, which saw its revenue climb 14% from last year to $24.21 billion in the most recent quarter. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it's confronting regulatory threats that could drag down its performance.\nA lucrative deal that generates about $20 billion in revenue by making Google the default search engine on the iPhone and Safari browser is being targeted in a high-profile antitrust case that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Google. A federal judge is expected is to issue a ruling by the end of this year.\nThe Justice Department also is targeting Apple in a separate lawsuit that it filed in March, alleging the company is illegally locking out competition by erecting unnecessary barriers around the iPhone. Apple has adamantly denied any wrongdoing and launched an attempt to have the case dismissed in documents filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court.\nThat started a legal process that will take several more months to play out before the presiding judge decides whether to throw out the case or allow it to proceed in a ruling likely to come late this year or early next year.\nAs has been happening during much of the past year, Apple\u2019s sales continued to erode in China \u2014 a worry for investors because the region is one of the company\u2019s key markets. Apple\u2019s revenue in China dropped 7% from last year in the past quarter.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 17 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks under hedge funds' radar.\nIt is no surprise that companies in the United States and China are leading the rest of the world when it comes to artificial intelligence. Conservative estimates about the impact of AI on the global economy, made by market experts at professional services firm PwC, reveal that AI-related gains, equal to close to $11 trillion, will account for nearly 70% of total global economic impact by 2030. In China, AI is expected to contribute to a nearly 26% boost to the GDP within the next six years, while this figure in the US will likely be 15%. AI no doubt represents the biggest commercial investment opportunity in this fast-paced world economy.\nSmart companies are seizing on this opportunity. According to market research firm IDC, investments in AI infrastructure will cross $30 billion this year and are projected to grow to $47 billion by 2028. This represents approximately 30% of the total global spending in AI. One of the most prominent AI use cases is in the customer service world. In this area, global businesses have spent more than $16 billion in 2024 so far. The impact of these investments in AI will be significant down the road. AI is likely to contribute to a $15 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, up 14% from current levels.\nLike other sectors of the economy, Wall Street is no stranger to AI. The debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of the AI revolution in the world of finance. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sales of software, hardware, and services for AI systems have climbed rapidly and will top $400 billion in 2027. Financial sector spending is likely to double to nearly $100 billion in 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 30% \u2014 the fastest of five major industries.

Reports this week have suggested that the firm is also working on a humanoid device powered by AI, for purposes as wide ranging as use as a desktop device to a home security robot, and that production of these devices could begin as early as 2026 or 2027. The new device would run Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI offerings that will soon be rolling out on Apple devices worldwide.\nApple Inc.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to hold its biggest product launch event of the year on Sept. 10, when the company will unveil the latest iPhones, watches and AirPods, according to people familiar with the situation.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints\nIntergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness\nAs Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow\nNazi Bunker\u2019s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher\nA Loud Warning From the Past About Living With Cars\nThough the timing hasn\u2019t yet been announced, the company is making preparations for that date, which falls on a Tuesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The unveiling will be followed by the phones going on sale Sept. 20, in line with Apple\u2019s typical approach in recent years.\nA representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\nThe launch is a critical one for Apple, which has suffered sluggish sales of its smartphones and wearable devices in recent quarters. A Sept. 20 release of the new iPhone 16 would mean some of the device\u2019s revenue is recorded in the current period \u2014 Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter \u2014 when the company expects sales to grow about 5% from a year earlier.\nA bigger chunk of sales will come the following quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. Analysts have predicted that revenue will climb 7% to $128.4 billion in that period.\nThe iPhone 16 will have larger screens on its Pro models and new camera features, such as a dedicated button for snapping photos. The company also is rolling out a suite of artificial intelligence tools called Apple Intelligence. Overall, though, the phones won\u2019t be vastly different than last year\u2019s models.\nApple\u2019s wearable devices, meanwhile, are due for bigger changes. The Apple Watch Series 10 models will be thinner but include larger screens. And Apple is revamping its AirPods lineup with new low-end and mid-tier versions. For the first time, the company will offer noise cancellation on its mid-level AirPods, and the entry-level model is getting updated for the first time since 2019.\nThe company is also planning to begin transitioning its Macs over to M4 processors later this year, but Mac updates typically don\u2019t arrive until about a month after the annual iPhone launch.\nTo that end, the company has ramped up testing of four new Mac models to ensure compatibility with third-party applications, according to developer test logs seen by Bloomberg News. That\u2019s a key step prior to launching the new machines. The Macs that appeared are labeled with the identifiers \u201c16,1,\u201d \u201c16,2,\u201d \u201c16,3\u201d and \u201c16,10.\u201d\nThey all represent models with base-level versions of the M4 chip.

The versions with 10-core CPUs also have 10-core GPUs, or graphics engines. The model with an eight-core CPU, meanwhile, has an eight-core graphics engine. They all have either 16 or 32 gigabytes of memory.\nThe 10-core CPU has the same specifications as the M4 processor in the iPad Pro, including four high-performance parts and six cores focused on efficiency. But the fourth chip seen in the developer logs only includes eight total cores, split between four high-performance parts and four efficiency cores.\nBloomberg News has reported that a smaller Mac mini, new MacBook Pros and updated iMacs with M4 chips are coming later this year.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis\nHong Kong\u2019s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City\u2019s Property Pain\nFar-Right \u2018Terrorgram\u2019 Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks\nUS Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe\nLosing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Apple (AAPL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AAPL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Apple's main business drivers.\nApple\u2019s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio that includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services now became the cash cow.Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod gained significant traction. In fact, Apple dominates the Wearables and Hearables markets due to the growing adoption of Watch and AirPods. Solid uptake of Apple Watch also helped Apple strengthen its presence in the personal health monitoring space.Apple is expanding non-iPhone portfolio with the launch of Apple Vision Pro a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world.Headquartered in Cupertino, CA, Apple also designs, manufactures and sells iPad, MacBookand HomePod. These devices are powered by software applications including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems.Apple\u2019s other services include subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, new Apple TV app, Apple TV channels and Apple TV+, a new subscription service.In fiscal 2023, Apple generated $383.29 billion in total revenues. The company\u2019s flagship device iPhone accounted for 52.3% of total revenues. Services, Mac and iPad category contributed 22.2%, 7.7% and 7.4%, respectively. Wearables, Home and Accessories products category contributed 10.4%.Apple primarily reports revenues on a geographic basis, namely the Americas (North & South America), Europe (European countries, India, Middle East and Africa), Greater China (China, Hong Kong & Taiwan), Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific (Australia & other Asian Countries).In fiscal 2023, Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific accounted for 42.4%, 24.6%, 18.9%, 6.3% and 7.7% of total revenues, respectively.Apple faces stiff competition from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Google, Huawei and Motorola in the smartphone market. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer and Asus are its primary competitors in the PC market. Other notable competitors are Google & Amazon (smart speakers) and Fitbit & Xiaomi (wearables).\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Apple ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in August 2014 would be worth $8,967.41, or a 796.74% gain, as of August 30, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 179.13% and gold's return of 87.86% over the same time frame.\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for AAPL.\nApple reported decline in iPhone sales in third-quarter fiscal 2024 partially offset by strong growth in Services revenues. Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.23%, and there have been 11 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since early last year, one of the driving forces behind the market rally has been the rapid and continuing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, many of this year's best-performing stocks have AI in common.\nOne company that's been curiously left out of the conversation is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). While other tech giants made a big splash about their plans to adopt and integrate generative AI, Apple was strangely silent. That is, until recently.\nIn early June, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of generative AI tools for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computer. The company noted that Apple Intelligence will be \"deeply integrated\" in the upcoming versions of its popular operating systems. Apple was also quick to point out that these tools will come with the company's legendary focus on privacy.\nApple has scheduled its next new product release for Monday, Sept. 9, with all eyes on the expected launch of iPhone 16. That said, investors will also be watching closely to see what details the company provides about its AI functionality. Many expect the company to make a big splash, which begs the question: Should investors buy Apple stock before the big event?\nHere are five reasons Apple stock is a smart buy before Sept. 9.\nApple has a long track record of debuting the upcoming version of its flagship iPhone at a September event, with the new devices shipping just weeks later. As a result, there's plenty of data to suggest how the stock will react on the heel's of the company's big reveal.\nThe data reveals that in the six months following a new iPhone release, the stock has gained more than 12%, on average, according to Dow Jones Market Data (via Barron's).\nMacroeconomic headwinds of the past couple of years have stunted sales of smartphones. The market slipped in 2023, with global smartphone shipments down 3.2% in 2023, according to market intelligence firm IDC. That isn't surprising, given that inflation was stubbornly perched at 20-year highs.\nHowever, with inflation cooling, consumers have more discretionary income, which is boosting smartphone sales. Just this week, IDC released its updated forecast for 2024, and the news was decidedly good. Worldwide smartphone shipments are expected to grow nearly 6% in 2024, reversing the declines of last year.\nA rising tide lifts all boats, or so the saying goes, so rising smartphone sales will no doubt benefit Apple.\nApple's iPhones have long been among the most sought-after, but the company reached a new pinnacle in 2023. For the first time last year, the company nabbed each of the top seven spots on the list of Top 10 best-selling smartphones, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research.\nThis came at a time when overall global smartphone sales were in a slump -- as noted above -- making the accomplishment all the more notable.\nThe past couple of years have been challenging for Apple. Sales slumped 3% last year and have only begun to turn around. Revenue edged 1% higher during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, dragged lower by iPhone sales that declined 1%.\nOne of the biggest factors weighing on Apple's sales last year was the state of the economy. Inflation crimped spending and consumers kept their existing iPhones longer. However, with the economy on the mend, the iPhone faithful will be looking to upgrade their existing devices.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives estimates there are roughly 300 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded in more than 4 years. He further suggests that demand could drive the sale of 240 million devices in fiscal 2025.\nImproving economic conditions could unleash a wave of pent-up demand, which would be a boon to Apple and its shareholders.\nThe upcoming iPhone release will be the first to include Apple Intelligence, the company's take on generative AI. It's no secret that AI has gone viral and captured the public imagination, and iPhone users likely aren't immune.\nWe don't yet have a lot of details about what AI-powered features will be included in the upcoming product release, but a significant enhancement to functionality and the novelty factor could be enough to drive strong demand for Apple's upcoming product cycle.\nBeyond the AI-fueled features, there's also the longer-term potential for apps that leverage generative AI. It's still early in the rollout of this groundbreaking technology, so there's still much more opportunity to create new use cases with AI. This, in turn, could drive additional demand for the iPhone.\nI generally urge investors to stay focused on the long term, but this is one of those rare exceptions. There are a number of near-term catalysts that could propel the stock higher in the months ahead -- but there's still no substitution for a long-term mindset.\nFor investors interested in initiating a position or adding to their stake in Apple, now might be a good time.\nIn any case, I believe the stars are beginning to align for Apple and its investors, and recent challenges could soon be a thing of the past.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Apple ended the quarter with channel inventory at the low end of its target range for iPhone and iPad, Hall highlighted.\nAlso, iPad and Mac revenue beat consensus revenue, reflecting new product launch benefits, with the latest iPads and Mac in the quarter all capable of supporting Apple Intelligence.\nHall highlighted Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue guidance for 5% Y/Y, including service revenue growth of 13% Y/Y, which implies 2% Y/Y product revenue growth.\nApple\u2019s reminders about tough comparisons on Mac (Y/Y comps), Wearables (Y/Y comps), and iPad (Q/Q comps) imply that iPhone revenue should grow Y/Y in the fourth quarter, indicating strong demand, as per the analyst.\nHe said that Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter gross margin guidance of 45.5%-46.5% (versus consensus of 45.7%) would mark a fourth-quarter record, even at the low end.\nThe fourth-quarter gross margin outlook supports the analyst\u2019s view that iPhone revenue in the September quarter should be substantial given that the iPhone has the highest margins in the products portfolio, providing mix benefits and that the recent services gross margin expansion to the mid-70% range is durable.\nHall projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.54 billion and $1.60.\nKeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel reiterated a Sector Weight rating on Apple.\nThe re-rating reflected the third-quarter results that came in better than expectations, but guidance aligned with expectations.\nNispel said Apple outperformed expectations across all product categories, ex Mac, and beat on services.\nWhile the guide is cryptic, he noted it implies iPhone +~3% Y/Y.\nBased on his conversations with carriers, Nispel remained skeptical of a significant acceleration in the upgrade cycle and noted a much more gradual replacement rate than the bulls.\nNispel\u2019s model continues to call for less growth than consensus, and he continues to see upgrade rate pressures and China competition, which limits his enthusiasm for Apple.\nNispel projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.10 billion and $1.58.\nPiper Sandler analyst Matt Farrell reiterated a Neutral rating on Apple with a $225 price target.\nApple delivered June quarter results slightly ahead of expectations, mainly due to strong growth in iPad and services, Farrell noted.\nThe analyst flagged that iPhone revenue was down 1% Y/Y in the June quarter despite the install base hitting new all-time highs.\nIn addition, Greater China\u2019s revenue showed further improvement in the June quarter. Farrell said investors remain laser-focused on the second half of the iPhone ramp.\nStill, based on the September quarter commentary, the analyst\u2019s iPhone revenue estimates remain unchanged for the back half of the calendar year. Management is very excited about the Apple Intelligence opportunity.\nHowever, it will roll out in stages across the globe, and Farrell is still cautious about the consumer entering the second half. The analyst continues to view shares as appropriately valued ahead of the upcoming iPhone 16 launch.\nFarrell projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.07 billion and $1.58.\nBofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on Apple with a price target of $256.\nThe re-rating reflected the expected strong iPhone upgrade cycle in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, higher growth in services revenue, higher margins from more internally developed silicon, continuing capital returns, and AI features that can drive higher institutional ownership.\nAccording to Mohan, results from Apple indicate improving trends across the portfolio where growth accelerated in iPhone, iPad, and wearables and across regions.\nAs per the analyst, implied revenue guidance of $94 billion will be conservative, especially around services and iPhones. Mohan noted the potential for significant acceleration of units in the December quarter and overall in fiscal 2025 with the rollout of Apple Intelligence.\nMohan said there is potential for consensus estimates to be revised higher given the multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, tailwinds to gross margins, and strong cash flows.\nMohan projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.75 billion and $1.61.\nPrice Action: AAPL is up 3.08% at $225.08 at the last check on Friday.\nImage via Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nBarclays\nMaintains\nEqual-Weight\nFeb 2022\nTigress Financial\nMaintains\nStrong Buy\nJan 2022\nCredit Suisse\nMaintains\nNeutral\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Apple's Multi-Year iPhone Upgrade Cycle and AI Features To Drive Upside, Analysts Say originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Max A. Cherney and Aditya Soni ",
        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney and Aditya Soni\n(Reuters) -Apple said its third-quarter iPhone sales were better than expected and forecast more gains on Thursday as it bets on artificial intelligence to attract buyers, even as its overall China business disappointed.\nShares of the company rose nearly 1% in extended trading, outperforming other tech stocks that were broadly lower.\nApple is expected to launch this fall what analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone. It includes artificial intelligence features and comes at a time when rivals such as Samsung have been quicker to roll out similar services.\nApple said revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter would grow at a level similar to the 4.9% increase it posted in the April-June period, which was better than analysts' estimates.\nSales of iPhone also improved in the third quarter, falling just 0.9% compared with the 2.2% drop analysts expected.\nChief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview that the iPhone results were better than he had expected three months ago. \"The iPhone 15 family has been doing well from the very beginning and still now - we have three quarters of the year behind us. It is performing better than the previous cycle, the iPhone 14.\"\nStill, China - Apple's third-largest market - remained a drag as sales there declined 6.5%. While that was an improvement from the 8.1% decline in the previous quarter, it was wider than expectations for a drop of 2.4%, according to Visible Alpha.\nMaestri said China sales fell less than 3%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and added that he feels good about Apple's performance in that country, given any softness in its economy.\nApple has taken to discounting its iPhones in China to compete with the much cheaper alternative smartphones offered by local competitors such as Huawei. The company in May offered discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($317) on selected models.\nAI PUSH\nAnalysts expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series, likely to be launched in September. The company unveiled a raft of AI products and services it calls Apple Intelligence at its developer conference in June.\nTo operate Apple Intelligence requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro, which may push consumers to upgrade their devices.\nWhile some analysts said that some consumers might have purchased the top-end iPhone 15 devices to tap the upcoming Apple Intelligence features, CEO Tim Cook told investors on Thursday it was \"too early to tell\" if that was driving upgrades.\nApple's AI features have arrived later than offerings by rivals including Samsung Electronics, which has introduced competing devices aimed at hosting AI chatbots. Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are placing huge bets on AI as well.\n\"The company's future success depends on two factors: keeping AI development costs low and ensuring that new AI-driven features compel price-sensitive consumers to upgrade their devices,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.\nApple started ramping up research and development spending last year, and Cook has said it has spent more than $100 billion on R&D in the past five years.\nMaestri told Reuters on Thursday that the company maintains \"very good gross margins\" despite the sometimes burdensome costs associated with building and running AI applications.\nApple splits its AI infrastructure costs between its own data centers and other cloud providers with whom it contracts.\nOn the regulatory front, Apple faces three probes in the European Union related to the Digital Markets Act, which requires large tech companies to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice. The bloc's antitrust regulator has accused Apple's App Store of breaching the DMA.\nIn the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market and driving up prices.\nApple's quarterly earnings per share were $1.40, above Wall Street estimates of $1.35, according to LSEG data.\nSales in Apple's services segment, which includes the App Store and represents Apple Music and TV products, rose 14.1% to $24.21 billion, above analyst expectations of $24.01 billion, according to LSEG data.\nMac sales grew 2.5% to $7.01 billion, compared with estimates of $7.02 billion, according to LSEG data.\nThe company's sales in the iPad segment increased by 23.7% to $7.16 billion, above analyst expectations of $6.61 billion, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for a product line that had languished for the past two years.\nIn the company's wearables segment, which represents sales of Apple Watches and AirPods headphones, sales fell 2.3% to $8.10 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $7.79 billion, according to LSEG data.\nApple maintained its dividend at 25 cents. In the fiscal second quarter, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe much-feared correction in mega-cap tech stocks is here as investors keep pulling out of AI winners to pile into small-cap stocks as possible rate cuts from the Federal Reserve near. Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming. However, Thill reiterated his view that in the back half of the year things will start to change and tech companies will start their rebound. The analyst cited a few software earnings that suggest no signs of \u201cdemand cracks.\u201d He said that many semiconductor stocks are now in the overbought territory.\nBrent Thill said the selloff has made software stocks more \u201cattractive.\u201d\nBut Thill also sees a broader rotation ongoing in the stock market, where sectors like financials and industrials are benefitting amid investor exodus from tech.\nAsked what is causing a sudden rebound in small-cap stocks, Thill said that interest rate cut expectations and a broader rotation out of mega-cap stocks have a role to play here, in addition to the M&A activity which has increased significantly recently.\nThill thinks the AI \u201cpayoff\u201d time is still years away and companies are still at the beginning of the AI spending curve.\nFor this article we compiled the biggest AI news updates and analyst rating upgrades/downgrades around AI stocks over the past few days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI initiative Apple Intelligence has started to make sense to Wall Street analysts. Recently, Baird raised its price target on the stock to $240 from $200, citing a potential upgrade cycle in iPhone because of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence.\nMarket's Huge Assumption About Apple\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at \u201csome point\u201d to take advantage of Apple Intelligence. \u00a0The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u00a0is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Why Apple (AAPL) International Revenue Trends Deserve Your Attention",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you assessed how the international operations of Apple (AAPL) performed in the quarter ended June 2024? For this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products, possessing an expansive global footprint, parsing the trends of international revenues could be critical to gauge its financial resilience and growth prospects.\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\nInternational market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.\nIn our recent assessment of AAPL's quarterly performance, we discovered notable trends in its overseas revenue sections, which are typically modeled and scrutinized by Wall Street analysts.\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter stood at $85.78 billion, increasing 4.9% year over year. Now, let's delve into AAPL's international revenue breakdown to gain insights into the significance of its operations beyond home turf.\nJapan accounted for 5.9% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $5.1 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -3.11%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $5.26 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Japan contributed $6.26 billion (6.9%) and $4.82 billion (5.9%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Europe contributed $21.88 billion in revenue, making up 25.5% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $20.65 billion, this meant a surprise of +6%. Looking back, Europe contributed $24.12 billion, or 26.6%, in the previous quarter, and $20.21 billion, or 24.7%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nOf the total revenue, $14.73 billion came from Greater China during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 17.2%. This represented a surprise of -3.03% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $15.19 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $16.37 billion, or 18%, and $15.76 billion, or 19.3%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nRest of Asia Pacific generated $6.39 billion in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 7.5% of the total. This represented a surprise of +4.66% compared to the $6.11 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of Asia Pacific accounted for $6.72 billion (7.4%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $5.63 billion (6.9%) to the total revenue.\nFor the current fiscal quarter, it is anticipated by Wall Street analysts that Apple will report a total revenue of $94.01 billion, which reflects an increase of 5% from the same quarter in the previous year. The revenue contributions are expected to be 6.3% from Japan ($5.87 billion), 25% from Europe ($23.49 billion), 17% from Greater China ($15.96 billion) and 7.2% from Rest of Asia Pacific ($6.78 billion).\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $390.32 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 1.8% from the year before. The revenues from Japan, Europe, Greater China and Rest of Asia Pacific are expected to make up 6.5%, 25.3%, 17.5% and 7.6% of this total, corresponding to $25.16 billion, $98.65 billion, $68.34 billion and $29.77 billion respectively.\nRelying on international markets for revenues, Apple faces both prospects and perils. Thus, tracking the company's international revenue trends is essential for accurately projecting its future trajectory.\nIn an era of growing international interdependencies and escalating geopolitical disputes, Wall Street analysts are vigilant in tracking these trends for businesses with a global reach, in order to refine their predictions of earnings. It should be noted, however, that a multitude of other elements, such as a company's domestic position, also play a significant role in shaping the earnings forecasts.\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\nOur proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, with its externally validated exceptional track record, harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions to serve as a dependable measure for anticipating the short-term price trends of stocks.\nCurrently, Apple holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), signifying its potential to outperform the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nThe stock has declined by 2.9% over the past month compared to the 2.9% fall of the Zacks S&P 500 composite. Meanwhile, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which includes Apple, has decreased 8.7% during this time frame. Over the past three months, the company's shares have experienced a gain of 20.1% relative to the S&P 500's 5.9% increase.

        "Author": "  Shanthi Rexaline ",
        "Text": "Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to splurge on a project that may not generate returns that commensurate with the investment in the near term, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman said on Sunday.\nLong-Term Focus: Apple is playing a long game with its efforts to build an in-house cellular modem, which is a key component of the iPhone, Apple Watch and other devices, said Gurman in the latest edition of the weekly Power On newsletter. Instead of looking at a major payoff at the outset, the company is hoping its modem will evolve into a more \u201cadvanced component\u201d that could ultimately change the way an iPhone looks and works, he said.\nDon't Miss:\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nThis startup\u2019s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing \u2014 Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors.\nApple has been sourcing the modem chips from Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) for more than a decade now. It is the most important component of the iPhone after the main processor and it is difficult to make, Gurman said.\nThe Apple specialist is of the view that it is tough to replace Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips as they are already state-of-the-art and that they have been \u201cbattle-tested by phone carriers around the world, making them highly reliable.\u201d \u00a0Johny Srouji, who runs the hardware team at Apple, said in a CNBC interview that it's unlikely that any upgrades Apple makes to the part will result in a better experience for users and that developing a modem was \u201cextremely difficult to do.\u201d\nSee Also: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nFallout & Patchup: Apple decided to take up modem chip manufacturing in 2018 when it faced a legal battle with Qualcomm over royalties and patents. The two parties reached a settlement a year later, agreeing to dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide.\nApple agreed to make a payment to Qualcomm and the two also signed a six-year license agreement, effective as of April 1, 2019, including a two-year option to extend, and a multiyear chipset supply agreement.\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nApple Persists: Despite the pushbacks, Apple is pushing ahead, said Gurman, adding that the company has earmarked \u201cbillions of dollars, thousands of engineers and millions of working hours to a project that won't really improve its devices \u2014 at least at the outset.\u201d\nSome Apple insiders are resigned to the fact that customers don\u2019t care about whether the modem used in their phones are made in-house or outsourced. Taking modem manufacturing in-house could help make the marketing pitch that most important iPhone components are made in-house but user experience won\u2019t noticeably change, said Gurman.\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nAlso Gurman noted that Apple\u2019s modem project suffered numerous setbacks over the past few years. These include issues with performance and overheating and delay in launch time at least until next year, he said. The columnist said Apple extending the supplier agreement with Qualcomm through March 2027 is due to its plan for a gradual rollout of the in-house modem chips, starting with niche models.\nOne of the reasons for moving to an in-house modem is to save money, given Apple has argued that Qualcomm charges too much for it, Gurman said. Even after the move, Apple may still have to cough up some amount as royalties to Qualcomm, he added.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nLong term, Apple could be benefited, as the tech giant plans to fold its modem design into \u201ca new wireless chip that handles Wi-Fi and Bluetooth access,\u201d Gurman said. \u201cThat would create a single connectivity component, potentially improving reliability and battery life.\u201d He also sees the possibility of Apple one day combiningg all of this into the device's main system on a chip, or SoC.\nThis, according to Gurman, could further cut costs and save space inside the iPhone, allowing for more design choices.\n\u201cThe best-case scenario is that it all goes smoothly, and most customers aren't even aware of the switch. But the project's real worth won't be tested until years later \u2014 when, Apple hopes, it sets the stage for a better iPhone,\u201d he said.\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\nRead Next:\nDuring market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses.\nDon\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Why Apple Is Plowing Billions Of Dollars Into A Project That Won't Have A Payoff Near Term: Gurman Weighs In originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Apple has taken the rare step of laying off around 100 people from its digital services division, including the Apple News and Apple Books apps, as the iPhone maker reshuffles its priorities to focus more on artificial intelligence, according to a report.\nThe affected employees, among them several engineers, were informed of the decision on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg News.\nApple Books, which lets users buy and download e-books and audiobooks, is considered less of a priority at the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News.\nThe layoffs also affected personnel at Apple News, the news aggregation app that curates articles from various publishers into a single, personalized feed \u2014 though sources told Bloomberg that the service remains a priority for the company.\nAffected workers were told they have 60 days to find another position within the company before being terminated.\nApple declined to comment on the Bloomberg News report.\nThe company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees as of Sept. 30, 2023, according to its latest annual report.\nApple, the world\u2019s richest company with a market cap of $3.47 trillion, has rarely had layoffs in the past. This year, however, there have been at least four rounds of job cuts.\nIn the spring, Apple cut hundreds of jobs after it shut down its self-driving car project.\nIt has previously suspended work on its next high-end Vision headset and shuttered a project to design and develop its own smartwatch displays earlier this year, according to media reports.\nOther tech companies have laid off workers on a far greater scale than Apple.\nSince the start of the year, tech companies worldwide have shed more than 134,000 jobs, according to the tracker site Layoffs.fyi.\nLinkedIn laid off 660 employees while Intel laid off more than 15,000 workers.\nApple snapped out of a prolonged sales slump during its most recent quarter as the trendsetting company prepares to launch into the artificial intelligence craze with an arsenal of new technology that\u2019s expected to juice demand for its next iPhone.\nThe fiscal third-quarter results announced earlier this month covered an April-June period that\u2019s typically a sluggish stretch for Apple as its loyal customer base awaits the next version of the iPhone that\u2019s traditionally unveiled shortly after Labor Day.\nEven so, Apple boosted its sales from a year ago \u2014 a welcome reversal of fortune on the heels of five consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines.\nWith Post wires\n"

While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a \u201clittle bit of a reset, obviously.\u201d The analyst said that AI stocks had a \u201cgreat run\u201d and the latest pullback is a \u201ctypical process\u201d of market rotation.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that\u2019s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,\u201d Landsberg said.\nAsked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and called the recent pullback \u201cdeceleration\u201d from growth and \u201cnormalization.\u201d\nLandsberg said that the earnings season will \u201cseparate the wheat from the chaff\u201d and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.\nFor this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock and increased his price target to $285 from $275.\n\u201cApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence rollout has already begun with developers who will significantly enhance app capabilities as the company staggers the launch of its new AI feature along with its OpenAI partnership which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0 expects ChatGPT and all other features to be integrated into the iPhone and other devices by the end of the year. We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front and adds $30 to $40 per share.\u201d Ives said.\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said he sees more upside for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the December quarter and next year on the back of Apple Intelligence. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating and $256 price target on Apple.\nHe said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) estimates could be revised higher due to \u201cmulti-year iPhone upgrade cycle, tailwinds to gross margins and strong cash flows.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it\u2019s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc.

        "Text": "Apple's (AAPL) stock closed out the trading day Friday on a slightly positive note despite posting a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales in its third quarter earnings on Thursday.\nWall Street was closely watching Apple's performance in China, one of its most important markets. The company has fought to regain market share from homegrown rivals including Huawei, but fell short of expectations in the region.\nApple saw revenue out of Greater China top out at $14.7 billion. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were anticipating revenue of $15.2 billion. Apple reported China revenue of $15.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Overall iPhone sales hit $39.2 billion versus expectations of $38.9 billion, falling short of the $39.6 billion Apple saw in Q3 2023.\nDespite the miss, Apple CFO Luca Maestri told Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton that the company's sales are generally improving in the region. What's more, Maestri said Apple is seeing record upgrades in the country and that sales were better than in the first half of the year.\nFor the quarter Apple saw earnings per share (EPS) of $1.40 on revenue of $85.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $1.35 and revenue of $84.4 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Apple saw EPS of $1.26 and revenue of $81.7 billion in the same period last year.\nShares of Apple are up some 18.6% year to date despite a difficult start to the year, thanks, in part, to the impact of the company\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference in May, where it showed off its Apple Intelligence software.\nServices revenue hit $24.2 billion. Wall Street was anticipating revenue in the segment of $23.9 billion. Apple's iPad sales topped $7.1 billion compared to the $6.6 billion analysts were anticipating, on the strength of the company's new iPad Pro line.\nMac revenue reached $7 billion, climbing above the $6.8 billion the segment saw last year. Wearables sales, however, declined to $8 billion from the $8.2 billion Apple reported last year.\nApple is also preparing to launch its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence software later this fall. The software, which is powered by Apple\u2019s generative AI technology, is set to hit iPhones, iPads, and Macs sometime in October, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\nAnalysts are torn on the potential impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales in the year ahead, with some saying the software will kick off a fresh iPhone sales supercycle and others laying out more bearish expectations for the technology\u2019s effect on Apple\u2019s bottom line.\nImportantly, Apple Intelligence is only compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and newer phones, which all but guarantees that any users desperate to get their hands on the technology will have upgrade to a new, more powerful phone as soon as it\u2019s available.\nEither way, if Apple is going to turn Apple Intelligence into a hit, it\u2019s going to need to ensure it has the capabilities that get customers excited to dive into the offering.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

It includes artificial intelligence features and comes at a time when rivals such as Samsung have been quicker to roll out similar services.\nThe new launches come as Apple forecasts more gains, betting on AI to attract buyers even as its overall China business disappointed in the third quarter.\nSales in Apple's third-largest market China declined 6.5%, wider than expectations of a drop of 2.4%, according to Visible Alpha.\nDuring its annual developer conference in June, Apple unveiled a long-awaited AI strategy, integrating its new \"Apple Intelligence\" technology across its suite of apps, including Siri and bringing OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices.\nApple still remains overly reliant on sales of the iPhone and some analysts said any boost from the new AI features was unlikely to materialize in the short term.\n(Reporting by Juby Babu in Mexico City; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n"

The theme of the event \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d \u2014 is a reference to the interface used by the new Siri digital assistant on the company\u2019s latest devices.\nApple had previously been preparing to hold the launch on Sept. 10, people familiar with the matter have said, though it will now be one day sooner. Sept. 10 is the date scheduled for the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump.\nThe iPhone 16 will have larger screens on its Pro models and new camera features, such as a dedicated button for taking photos. But perhaps the biggest component of the keynote will be the discussion of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s suite of AI features that will be available on all of the new iPhone models.\nBesides the new iPhones, Apple is preparing major changes to its smartwatch lineup and revamped AirPods. The next version of the standard Apple Watch will get bigger displays and a thinner look. The company has also been planning a version of its low-end Watch SE that is made out of plastic for the first time.\nApple has been readying two new AirPods models: a new low-end version to replace the one from 2019, plus a replacement for the mid-tier AirPods that launched in 2021. Both models will include new designs that look more like the AirPods Pro, while the mid-level one will gain noise cancellation for the first time.\nThe event is critical for Apple, which is betting on the new products to help revive growth in its iPhone and wearable-device segments. During its latest earnings call, Apple implied that iPhone sales in the current quarter would be flat, but it didn\u2019t comment on the holiday season.\nApple has been preparing to release the new iPhones around Sept. 20, which would mean that about a week and a half of those sales would come in the current period. The company may get a boost later in October when Apple Intelligence is released as part of the iOS 18.1 operating system. The initial iPhone 16 models are expected to ship with iOS 18.0, which doesn\u2019t include many of the AI-driven enhancements.\n(Updates with more details on iPhone 16 line and other products throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis\nHong Kong\u2019s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City\u2019s Property Pain\nFar-Right \u2018Terrorgram\u2019 Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks\nUS Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.\n\u201cNow that positions have been unwound, there\u2019s an opportunity for traders to take positions,\u201d Sluymer reportedly said.\nMany others agree with Sluymer.

And the growth scare that we saw, it\u2019s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,\u201d Ives said.\nFor this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public DomainIs Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News?\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nMorgan Stanley said in a new report that Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 production was stronger than expected in July, with growing momentum leading up to the iPhone 16 launch. Analysts, led by Erik Woodring, reported that their checks from the Greater China Tech Hardware team showed iPhone builds in July surpassed initial expectations, prompting an upward revision of September quarter iPhone builds to 54 million units, an 8% increase year-over-year and 2 million units higher than previously forecasted.\nWhile the real test will be early October\u2019s iPhone sales, the analysts noted that momentum appears to be building as the iPhone 16 launch approaches. The increase for the September quarter reflects the continued strength of the iPhone 15 late in its cycle, with no changes to the production of other iPhone models. However, it\u2019s unclear if this trend is driven by anticipation for Apple Intelligence or other factors.\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at \u201csome point\u201d to take advantage of Apple Intelligence. \u00a0The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u00a0is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance after unveiling its AI strategy to its software developers. The Company has been at the forefront of proprietary computer processor development for over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well-situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. While revenue growth has been relatively flat post-Covid-19, we expect Apple\u2019s AI value proposition will be compelling enough for consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.\u201d\n\u00a0Overall,\u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other important AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds. These are the best AI stocks to buy according to the market participants and hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company is working to include AI products into the consumer electronics it markets, most notably the iPhone, expected to be released later this year. Some reports indicate that the firm will debut Apple Intelligence in the new phone. At a tech event earlier this year, the firm revealed some of the capabilities of the new AI offering, which included massive changes to popular iPhone applications like Siri, Genmoji, and Image Playground. There are rumors that the firm may put advanced features of the AI software behind some kind of a paywall.\nTim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), praised the performance of in-house chips during the second quarter earnings call, noting that Mac computers were powered by Apple silicon with a powerful neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level. He said these computers would be able to take advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia, two new AI products of the firm.\nOverall AAPL ranks 30th on our list of the most important AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) recently posted its Fiscal Q3 earnings, revealing a series of bullish indicators alongside a notable concern. In this article, we will explore five key bullish signs emerging from Apple\u2019s latest results that highlight its growth potential and overall financial strength. At the same time, I will address one red flag that could negatively influence the stock\u2019s investment case. For this particular reason, I remain neutral on AAPL stock despite its otherwise attractive characteristics.\nThe first and most apparent highlight from Apple\u2019s Fiscal Q3 report was that the company\u2019s revenues hit a record $85.8 billion, marking a 5% increase compared to last year. Notably, this figure beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a significant $1.85 billion, despite the company facing a 230 basis point headwind from foreign exchange fluctuations.\nCEO Tim Cook highlighted that Apple achieved revenue records in over two dozen countries, including major markets like Canada, France, and India. Considering the prevalent sentiment that Apple\u2019s growth has lagged lately, seeing decent single-digit growth and records across different geographies is certainly quite encouraging.\nThe second highlight from Apple\u2019s Q3 report is the acceleration in revenue growth from Services. Services revenue hit a record $24.2 billion, marking a 14% rise from the previous year and an acceleration from last year\u2019s growth of 8%. The growth in Services helped drive this quarter\u2019s revenue growth mentioned earlier, while reflecting strong performance across advertising, cloud, and payment services.\nNotably, the number of paid subscriptions skyrocketed to over one billion, with Apple more than doubling this figure from just four years ago. I believe the continued growth in Service revenues emphasizes the growing consumer reliance on Apple\u2019s ecosystem of services, from Apple TV+ to Apple Music, among others.\nAnother highlight revolving around Apple\u2019s growth was tied to the iPad and Mac divisions, which showed notable growth during the quarter. iPad revenue surged 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, which feature significant upgrades like the M4 chip and enhanced AI capabilities. Meanwhile, Mac revenue grew 2% to $7 billion, fueled by the success of the M3-powered MacBook Air.\nSure, demand for Apple\u2019s devices tends to be cyclical. For example, iPad sales are likely to dip following this year\u2019s strong surge. Still, Apple\u2019s growth across these two divisions highlights its continued appeal in both personal and professional computing.\nAnother bullish indicator highlighted by Apple\u2019s management during the post-earnings call is the company\u2019s outstanding customer satisfaction, as demonstrated by its record-breaking installed base of active devices. Management reported that its installed base reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.\nNotably, customer satisfaction metrics for Apple products remained extremely high, with the iPhone 15, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch all receiving top ratings. For example, iPhone 15 satisfaction was reported at 98% in the U.S., while customer satisfaction for iPad and Apple Watch stood at 97%.\nWhile these numbers don\u2019t directly reflect Apple\u2019s underlying financials, they suggest that demand and sales volumes regarding future device releases should remain robust. Evidently, Apple expects very strong sales for the upcoming release of iPhone 16.\nLast but not least, Apple\u2019s Fiscal Q3 report reminded us of its remarkable financial strength, which enables it to sustain superb shareholder returns. The company ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities, with its net cash standing at $52 billion. Apple continued to buy back shares at a rapid pace, which was in line with management\u2019s long-term goal of reaching a neutral net cash position.\nThe company repurchased $69.9 billion worth of stock during the first nine months of this fiscal year, up from $56.5 billion last year. The company is currently on track to repurchase $100 billion worth of stock for the year. While at Apple\u2019s current humongous market cap, even such a large amount translates to a thin buyback yield of just 3%, it is still likely to support the stock\u2019s upward momentum.\nDespite Apple celebrating several positive developments in its Fiscal Q3 results, its report exposed the one red flag that investors should be wary of \u2014 its valuation. The company continued to post notable revenue growth, while earnings per share also grew by a remarkable 10.2% to $1.70. Yet, it\u2019s hard to justify the forward P/E ratio of 32.3x based on this year\u2019s consensus EPS estimate of $6.71 and Apple\u2019s current stock price.\nWall Street is confident that Apple can maintain double-digit EPS growth over the medium term, with the upcoming iPhone 16 potentially serving as a major catalyst. This release could mark the beginning of a new era for Apple as it introduces truly AI-powered smartphones. I\u2019ve explored this topic in more depth in another article, which I encourage you to check out if you\u2019re interested.\nHowever, even with Wall Street\u2019s optimistic projections, Apple stock is currently trading at a hefty forward P/E ratio of 20.6x its expected 2027 EPS. In my view, this high multiple could limit Apple\u2019s upside potential in the future, thus hindering its investment case.\nDespite the stock\u2019s hefty valuation, Wall Street remains relatively bullish on Apple. Specifically, AAPL stock features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $248.78, the\u00a0average AAPL stock price target\u00a0implies 12.4% upside potential.\nSee more AAPL analyst ratings\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell AAPL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Krish Sanka of TD Cowen, with an average return of 42.3% per rating and a 91% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\nApple\u2019s Q3 results showed developments and growth across the board, including solid revenue growth, particularly in Services, and an ever-expanding device install base. However, despite these positives, the stock\u2019s high valuation poses a concern. While Apple\u2019s financial strength and robust product demand are clear, its forward P/E ratio suggests that future upside may be limited. As a result, I remain neutral on Apple stock, acknowledging its strengths but cautious of its potential for overvaluation.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) suffered a staggering shot to its search and advertising business on Monday as District of Columbia's Judge Amit Mehta ruled in favor of the Department of Justice in its antitrust suit against the tech giant.\nIt may cost Apple (AAPL) big-time too.\nHere's how: The ruling could force Google to make dramatic changes to its largest business, but it could also force the company to cancel a long-term revenue-sharing agreement with Apple that requires the iPhone maker to use Google as the default search engine across its various devices.\nThe deal, called an Information Services Agreement, has been in place since 2002 and has been adjusted over the years as new technologies, such as the iPhone, have been introduced. The gist of the deal is that Apple uses Google as its default search engine for its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri.\nIn return, Google pays Apple 36% of the search revenue generated on Apple devices using Google\u2019s services. While Apple doesn\u2019t reveal exactly how much it makes from the deal, court documents pegged the number at an estimated $20 billion in 2022, double what Google paid in 2020.\nApple couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\nThe revenue from Google and Apple\u2019s agreement is likely realized under Apple\u2019s Services business segment, which is where it lists third-party advertising licensing agreements. In 2022, Apple saw $78.1 billion in Services revenue. If the $20 billion estimate is accurate, that means the deal accounted for roughly 25% of Apple\u2019s Services revenue for the year.\nApple\u2019s Services business is one of its fastest-growing segments and is seen as a bulwark against the company\u2019s slowing iPhone sales. The company has expanded the segment significantly over the years, adding its Apple Music+ and Apple TV+ platforms to the business. But the Google deal still likely makes up a massive chunk of the Services segment\u2019s revenue.\nFrom a company-wide perspective, Apple generated $394.3 billion in revenue in 2022, meaning the Google agreement accounted for 5% of the company\u2019s annual revenue for the year.\nLosing the ISA wouldn\u2019t just hurt Apple, though. According to court documents, Google performed internal modeling in 2020 that found it would lose 60% to 80% of search volume on Apple\u2019s iOS devices if its search engine were replaced as the default option.\nLosing that search volume would cut into Google\u2019s bottom line to the tune of $28 billion to $32 billion. With Google bringing in $182.5 billion in revenue in 2020, that would slice 15% to 17% off of the company\u2019s bottom line.\nGoogle is sure to appeal the DOJ\u2019s win, but if Mehta\u2019s ruling stands, Apple and Google could be in for some serious financial pain.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Google\u2019s defeat in an antitrust suit filed by the Justice Department has cast a shadow over partner Apple Inc., which generates roughly $20 billion a year in payments from the internet search giant.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture\nNYC Subway Riders See \u2018Exceptionally High\u2019 Air Pollution\nNew York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants\nNew York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\nApple shares slipped almost 5% on Monday after a judge ruled that Google\u2019s payments to device makers \u2014 made in return for its search engine getting preferential placement \u2014 were illegal. The decision handed a win to the Justice Department in its first major antitrust case against Big Tech in more than two decades.\nFor Apple, the move jeopardizes a revenue stream that has helped bolster sales in recent years. But the iPhone maker has already been moving away from its dependence on traditional internet searches. With Apple revamping its Siri digital assistant to handle queries more deftly \u2014 and integrating AI chatbots into its software \u2014 it\u2019s betting that AI technology will eventually take over.\nThat underlines the government\u2019s struggle with the technology industry: It moves so quickly that by the time a serious reckoning comes, the industry is already restructuring itself around the next innovation.\nApple is weaving OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT capabilities into its software and expects to do the same with Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot. Over time, the company could steer consumers toward AI and Siri instead of the web browser.\nThat would give Apple the opportunity to reach new, nonexclusive agreements with AI providers \u2014 including Google \u2014 that don\u2019t run afoul of the US government. Still, it will likely take many years for Apple to make serious money from AI.\nFor Google, the decision is a bit of a mixed blessing, given the hefty amounts that it\u2019s paid Apple to make its search engine the default option.\n\u201cIn the short term, it actually could save them a lot of money,\u201d said Ari Paparo, an advertising entrepreneur who used to work at Google.\nMonday\u2019s decision didn\u2019t mandate the ways Google could satisfy the government, but Judge Amit Mehta scheduled a hearing next month to discuss timing of a separate trial on that topic. It\u2019s unlikely that the court could force Apple to drop Google as a search partner altogether as one of the remedies, but it could potentially change the agreement\u2019s terms \u2014 and level the playing field.\nOne theoretical scenario would be Apple presenting different search engine options to consumers when they turn on their new device for the first time. Such a system could work similarly to a menu on Apple devices in the European Union that presents a choice of web browsers.\nWith that approach, Google would still remain an option, but customers could also pick alternatives such as Microsoft Bing or DuckDuckGo. Currently, users need to delve into the iPhone settings app to change their default search engine.\nIn his decision, Mehta said that the lucrative Google agreement has disincentivized Apple from launching its search engine \u201cwhen it otherwise has built the capacity to do so.\u201d\nJohn Giannandrea, an ex-Google executive who oversees AI at Apple, has a search team working for him. But they\u2019ve been more focused on search capabilities within Apple\u2019s software, rather than the ability to do Google-style web queries.\nEven so, Apple\u2019s interface is set to change in the coming months. The company will be rolling out Apple Intelligence, its new suite of artificial intelligence features, which could eventually transform the way people use their iPhones and other devices.\nThe changes include a new \u201cType to Siri\u201d approach that makes it easier to use the virtual assistant without having to speak to it. That will allow users to send queries to AI engines from anywhere in the iPhone, iPad or Mac operating systems.\n--With assistance from Julia Love.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town\nNate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler\nFive Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., seeking new sources of revenue, is moving forward with development of a pricey tabletop home device that combines an iPad-like display with a robotic limb.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival\n\u2018Train Lovers\u2019 Organize to Support Harris and Walz in Presidential Bid\nPart of Downtown Montreal Is Flooded After Water Pipe Breaks\nClimate Disasters Are an Affordable Housing Problem\nNJ Transit Dishes Out Free Rides After Summer Train Chaos\nThe company now has a team of several hundred people working on the device, which uses a thin robotic arm to move around a large screen, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The product, which relies on actuators to tilt the display up and down and make it spin 360 degrees, would offer a twist on home products like Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Echo Show 10 and Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s discontinued Portal.\nThe device is envisioned as a smart home command center, videoconferencing machine and remote-controlled home security tool, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work isn\u2019t public. The project \u2014 codenamed J595 \u2014 was approved by Apple\u2019s executive team in 2022 but has started to formally ramp up in recent months, they said.\nThe shift into robotics is part of a broader effort to boost sales and capitalize on Apple Intelligence, a suite of artificial intelligence technology that\u2019s coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac this year. The company also is seeking new growth opportunities after ending efforts to develop a self-driving car earlier this year.\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\nApple\u2019s industrial design team has been exploring tabletop robotic concepts for years, but there wasn\u2019t consensus within the company \u2014 including the software engineering organization and marketing teams \u2014 over whether to move forward.\nApple\u2019s marketing group was concerned that consumers wouldn\u2019t be willing to pay for such a product. Top software engineering executives, meanwhile, fretted about the staffing resources it would require to build the necessary software. But Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is seen as a proponent of the device \u2014 as is John Ternus, the company\u2019s head of hardware engineering.\nApple has now decided to prioritize the device\u2019s development and is aiming for a debut as early as 2026 or 2027, according to the people. The company is looking to get the price down to around $1,000. But with years to go before an expected release, the plans could theoretically change.\nIn a sign of support, Apple has made the project the sole responsibility of Kevin Lynch, a veteran executive. He serves as vice president of technology and oversaw the self-driving car and, until recently, Apple\u2019s smartwatch and health software engineering efforts.\nLynch recently enlisted key lieutenants who helped launch the Apple Watch to work on the tabletop robot, as well as well-known robotics researchers and engineers. Lynch reports to John Giannandrea, Apple\u2019s head of artificial intelligence.\nThe idea is for the tabletop product to be primarily controlled using the Siri digital assistant and upcoming features in Apple Intelligence. The device could respond to commands, such as \u201clook at me,\u201d by repositioning the screen to focus on the person saying the words \u2014 say, during a video call. It also could understand different voices and adjust its focus accordingly. Current models in testing run a customized version of the iPad operating system.\nThe hardware engineering group is also involved. Matt Costello, an executive who leads development of Apple\u2019s HomePod smart speaker, is overseeing the hardware side of the project. The company also is working on robots that move around the home and has discussed the idea of a humanoid version. Those projects are being led, in part, by Hanns Wolfram Tappeiner, a robotics expert who now has about 100 former car team engineers reporting to him.\nIn a job listing published this month, Apple said it has a team \u201cworking to leverage and build upon groundbreaking machine learning robotics research, thereby enabling development of generalizable and reliable robot systems.\u201d The company said it\u2019s seeking experts with experience in \u201crobot manipulation\u201d and creating AI models for robot control.\nLynch has been entrusted with some of Apple\u2019s biggest projects. He was instrumental in bringing the first Apple Watch to market in 2015 and was tapped in 2021 to oversee the car effort.\nUnder Lynch, the car project made progress \u2014 though the product\u2019s ambitions were also reduced along the way. But by 2024, costs had added up to at least $10 billion and the car industry suffered a slowdown. There were concerns about Apple being able to stand out in a crowded field, and management decided to shut down the initiative in a rare high-profile retreat.\nThe capabilities of the tabletop device have been in flux as well. Some people involved in the project say the features have been scaled back from initial ambitions, with one person describing the development process as a roller-coaster ride.\nOthers within Apple still question whether the device will appeal to consumers and whether the company really needs another tablet-like product. Though the new Vision Pro headset melds virtual and augmented reality, it ultimately duplicates the features of an iPad.\nApple also has had trouble cracking the market for smart-home devices. Its HomePod speakers haven\u2019t sold as well as models from Amazon and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, and the Apple TV set-top box lags behind Roku Inc. devices and other rivals.\nThe robotics effort is one of a few avenues Apple is pursuing to generate new sources of revenue.\nThe company is also working on augmented reality glasses, as well as exploring less ambitious products like smart glasses that would be similar to Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban spectacles. That product \u2014 which Meta has described as a hit \u2014 stops short of offering a true AR experience but let users make phone calls and capture video.\nIn addition, Apple is looking to create a version of its AirPods earbuds that include cameras, letting them better sense the outside world. And it\u2019s working on a giant, foldable iPad \u2014 something that might not arrive until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest, according to people with knowledge of the effort.\nApple still gets roughly half its revenue from the iPhone, which has sold sluggishly in recent quarters. The company is planning to launch new models in September that feature better cameras, processors and displays. But that\u2019s only expected to generate modest growth.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018I\u2019m So Scared\u2019: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport\nWhere All the Sports Betting Money Actually Goes\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nSingapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem\nSports Betting Is Legal, and Sportswriting Might Never Recover\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

As of 11:59 a.m. ET, the stock was still down 3.7%.\nThe major market indexes were all under pressure Monday, partially the result of a carry trade rout sparked by a rate hike by the Bank of Japan. However, Apple had its own problems, as one of the company's biggest proponents sold a huge block of stock.\nIt's no secret that Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has long been a fan of Apple stock. Since Berkshire's first investment back in 2016, Buffett has been a celebrated Apple bull, with the consumer electronics giant representing Berkshire's biggest equity holding.\nReports emerged over the weekend that Buffett continued to unload Apple shares, continuing a trend that began earlier this year. The celebrated investor sold an additional 390 million shares of Apple stock in the second quarter, adding to the 115 million shares sold in Q1.\nIn all, Berkshire has sold more than half its stake in Apple, but that only tells part of the story. Buffett has been on a selling spree of late, selling roughly $76 billion in stocks last quarter, and bringing Berkshire's cash hoard to a record $277 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nThere's no denying the continued selling suggests that the so-called Oracle of Omaha has soured on Apple, but the sales require context. When Berkshire first sold a tranche of Apple stock in the first quarter, he suggested the move was made for tax purposes. Buffett said he expects corporate tax rates to be higher in the future, noting that the company is paying a 21% tax rate this year, and it might be \"a little higher percentage later on.\"\nIn fact, at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting back in early May, Buffett said it was \"extremely likely\" Apple stock would continue to be Berkshire's largest position to close out 2024.\nIt's important to note that even after the massive sale, Apple is still Berkshire's largest stock holding by a wide margin, worth roughly $84 billion as of market close on Friday.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other 5G stocks.\n5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the latest evolution in mobile networks, which is designed to significantly improve speed, reduce latency, and enhance the capacity and connectivity of mobile devices. A Market Research Future report estimates that in 2024, the 5G market is projected to be worth $15.03 billion, and by 2032, it could reach $229.41 billion. This rapid increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.60% during the forecast period. According to some experts, 5G is one of the most important trends in technology along with artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn a CNBC interview at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai on June 26, director-general of the GSM Association, Mats Granryd highlighted the deep connection between 5G and AI and suggested that their mutual rise is not accidental. He said that \u201cAI feeds off 5G and 5G feeds off AI.\u201d\u00a0 This is especially evident in China, where the development of standalone 5G networks is well advanced and discussions are already shifting toward 5G Advanced (5.5G). While some countries lag, like the Philippines, Mats pointed out that this dynamic between 5G and AI is most prominent in regions with widespread 5G coverage.\nWhen asked about the rivalry between countries like the U.S. and China in AI and 5G, Mats said that such competition is insignificant. He said that from his experience on the GSMA board, which represents the 25 largest mobile operators globally, the focus is on creating common standards and specifications rather than competing.\nHe talked about the difficulties of the 2G and 3G eras when different technologies created challenges for global connectivity. The shift to a unified 4G standard was a pivotal moment that laid the foundation for the digital economy.\nMats believes that 5G will follow a similar path to become a common platform worldwide, which will also extend to AI. While some regions may advance faster than others initially, he showed confidence in the fact that everyone will eventually catch up and benefit from the integration of AI with 5G.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs to identify companies involved in the 5G market. We then selected 10 stocks with the smallest short interest and listed them in descending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

It is known for its innovative consumer electronics, software, and services, and is best known for its flagship products including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The company also offers a suite of services such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay. It takes the 3rd spot on our list of best 5G stocks according to short sellers.\nApple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5G journey started with its iPhone 12 in 2020 and it supported more 5G frequencies than any of its competitors in the market. While the company still uses Qualcomm modems, KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the company has plans to launch two iPhone models with its in-house 5G modem in 2025.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took the first major step toward the development of its modems when it agreed to acquire the majority of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business for $1 billion in 2019. The acquisition brought around 2,200 Intel employees, intellectual property, and equipment to Apple. Ming-Chi Kuo believes that a fourth-generation iPhone SE in the first quarter and a new ultra-thin iPhone 17 in the third quarter could have the company\u2019s own modems.\nIn the second quarter, 184 hedge funds had stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at a combined value of $124.175 billion. As of Q2,\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0owns 400 million shares of the company, worth $84.25 billion, making it the most prominent shareholder.\nMar Vista Investment Partners, LLC\u00a0stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd\u00a0in our list of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share, indicating a change of +8.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.4%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $94.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.2%. The $390.22 billion and $424.35 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.8% and +8.8%, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning a new version of the Mac mini that will be its smallest desktop computer yet, part of a broader overhaul of the Mac line with AI-focused chips.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money\nBiden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction\nIn DNC, Chicago\u2019s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test\nJohannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\nGottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays\nThe new model \u2014 due later this year \u2014 will mark the first major design change to the mini since it was revamped under Steve Jobs in 2010, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The device will be far smaller than its predecessor, approaching the size of an Apple TV set-top box, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is secret.\nThe updated mini is one of several new Macs coming over the next several months. The company is preparing versions of the iMac desktop and MacBook Pro with chips from the M4 line, also for as early as this year. There are MacBook Airs in development for the spring, and Mac Pro and Mac Studio models are planned for the middle of next year.\nThe mass upgrade to the M4 processor marks another milestone for Apple: It\u2019s the first time the company is putting the same chip generation in all its Macs. The M4 silicon \u2014 already featured in the iPad Pro \u2014 is meant to power new artificial intelligence features that Apple is beginning to roll out later this year.\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\nDespite the smaller overall design, the new Mac mini may be taller than the current version. Today\u2019s model is about 1.4 inches high. The updated edition will still feature an aluminum shell.\nThe Apple TV box, meanwhile, is about 3.7 inches across \u2014 currently less than half the size of the Mac mini.\nApple has tested models with at least three USB-C ports on the back of the mini, in addition to an area for plugging in the power cable and an HDMI port for connecting the device to TV sets and monitors.\nPeople involved in the development of the new Mac mini say it\u2019s essentially an iPad Pro in a small box \u2014 an approach that takes advantage of the lower power requirements of the company\u2019s in-house silicon. The current Mac mini starts at $599, and while the new model may be cheaper to make, it\u2019s unclear if the company will pass along any savings to the consumer.\nApple is preparing two versions of the new Mac mini, both of which are codenamed J773. The first will use the base configuration of the M4 chip, similar to the component inside of the iPad Pro. There will also be a higher-end Mac mini that uses a yet-to-be-announced M4 Pro chip. That component includes support for additional memory and more graphics horsepower.\nApple suppliers are planning to begin shipping units of the standard M4 version this month for release later in the year. Units with the higher-end M4 Pro won\u2019t be ready for consumers until October. The Mac mini was last updated in early 2023 with M2 and M2 Pro chips. It gained the M1 chip in November 2020 as part of the first range of Macs with Apple silicon.\nApple\u2019s shift to its own computer processors helped fuel sales and accelerated the pace of upgrades. But Mac demand has slowed since the pandemic, when consumers were racing to equip their home offices.\nThe category generated about $7 billion in revenue last quarter, up 2.5% from a year earlier.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nNew Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas)\nKamala Harris 4.0: Liberal, Moderate or Something Else?\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

The App Store group is being split into two teams: one overseeing Apple\u2019s own store and another responsible for alternative app distribution.\nPhil Schiller, the executive who is ultimately responsible for the App Store, is making the changes in response to regulators forcing Apple to allow alternative stores and payment methods for apps on the iPhone, iPad and the company\u2019s other devices.\n\u201cAfter 21 years at Apple, I\u2019ve made the decision to step away from our incredible company,\u201d Fischer told his team in an email Wednesday. \u201cThis has been on my mind for some time, and as we are also reorganizing the team to better manage new challenges and opportunities, now is the right moment to pass the baton to two outstanding leaders on my team.\u201d\nCarson Oliver, a longtime senior director, will run the App Store group, while Ann Thai, a director in charge of App Store features like search and discovery, will lead the new team responsible for alternative distribution.

Mac computer sales rose 3% to $7 billion.\nThe only region that showed a decline in net sales was Greater China, which continues the tech company\u2019s struggles there. The Chinese government has expressed concerns about the security of Apple devices and China represents almost a fifth of Apple\u2019s overall net sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that more than 50% of the decline in the most-recent quarter year-over-year was currency-related, which was \u201can improvement\u201d from the first half of the fiscal year.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re happy to see the acceleration,\u201d Cook said, adding the company remained \u201cconfident in the long-term opportunity\u201d in the competitive market.\nOn Thursday, Cook touted the success of AppleTV+ productions, which scored 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs, the best-ever showing for the streaming arm.\n\u201cApple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens, large and small, we\u2019re sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d the upcoming \u201cDisclaimer\u201d and \u201dThe Instigators\u201d starring Matt Damon,\u201d the tech company\u2019s CEO said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d \u201cSlow Horses\u201d and \u201dSeverance.\u201d\nDuring the quarter, Apple\u2019s EPS growth of 11% and nearly $29 billion in operating cash flow allowed the the tech giant to return more than $32 billion to shareholders, Apple\u2019s CFO Luca Maestri said. \u201cWe are also very pleased that our installed base of active devices reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.\u201d\nWhat Wall Street was more interested in further understanding about Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s company-wide AI initiative. Cook promised that Apple \u201cwill continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential.\u201d\nApple officially jumped into the AI arms race in June when it unveiled its plans for integrating AI technology into its products, including a partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Apple\u2019s intends to integrate machine learning capabilities across all of the company\u2019s product offerings, including Siri.\nBut like its rivals, including Meta Platforms, Apple is struggling to explain how it will monetize the new technology \u2014 and what the timetable is to realize a return on investment.\nThe integration \u201cbuilds on years of innovation and investment in AI and machine learning, it will transform how users interact with technology,\u201d Cook said Thursday. He added that it was \u201ca breakthrough personal intelligence system that puts powerful, private generative AI models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\u201d\nChatGPT integration will be coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and MacOS later this year, the company said during June\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The function will serve as an extension of Apple Intelligence, providing further \u201cexpertise\u201d details from the OpenAI chatbot with user control over whether they want to share data to use the function.\nApple also noted it intends to expand further by partnering with more AI companies in the future.\nThe post Apple Reports Record Q3 Revenue of $85.8 Billion, With AI Expansion on the Horizon appeared first on TheWrap.\n"

        "Author": "  Ivan Mehta ",
        "Text": "Apple gave users the first real taste of its Apple Intelligence features with the release of the iOS 18.1 developer beta last month. Writing Tools, which lets you reformat or rewrite text using Apple's AI models, is one of the new always-available services in this update. But the tool will show you a message notifying you that AI-generated suggestions might not be of the highest quality when tackling certain topics.\nYou can call up Apple Intelligence pretty much anywhere across the system when you need to rejig text. However, when you try to rewrite a paragraph or a sentence that has swear words, including \"s---\" and \"bastard,\" you will see a warning saying, \"Writing Tools was not designed to handle this type of content,\" with a header text warning that the quality of rewriting may vary.\nSwear words are not the only things that trigger this warning. Mentions of drugs, killing, or murder will also bring up this warning.\nEven when Apple Intelligence shows the warning, it still offers suggestions for sentences when you use one of the words or phrases that it hasn't been trained on. One time in testing, I replaced \"sh---y\" with \"crappy\" to make the warning go away, and the AI tool returned the exact same suggestion as before.\nWe have asked Apple to provide more information on what topics the writing tools are not trained to give a suggestions on. We will update the story if we hear back from the company.\nApple is likely avoiding any controversy by prohibiting the tackling of certain words, topics and tones when its AI is rewriting sentences. Apple Intelligence-powered writing tools are not geared to generate new content from scratch, anyway. However, Apple wants to warn people when AI is looking at these terms.\nIt took Apple years to remove a block on swear words from the keyboard's autocorrect suggestions. Last year, with iOS 17, Apple finally rolled out an autocorrect feature that learns your swears. Perhaps with Apple Intelligence, Apple is just being cautious to prevent regulators from blaming it for generating problematic content.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/apple-intelligences-writing-tools-stumble-on-swears-and-controversial-topics/\n"

        "Text": "After Apple (AAPL)\u00a0reported fiscal third-quarter results that topped analysts' expectations, CEO Tim Cook gave investors an update on the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities, outlook, and more in the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday.\nAmid speculation about when new AI features will be released after Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence in June, Cook suggested the new features will become available to users over time rather than all at once.\nThe CEO said the company plans to roll out Apple Intelligence to U.S. English users in the fall, and then \"proceed with more functionality, more features, and more languages and regions\" in the next year.\nCook also said Apple plans to integrate ChatGPT features into iPhones by the end of the 2024 calendar year through its partnership with OpenAI.\nApple provided developers a first look at Apple Intelligence ahead of reporting earnings through the beta version of iOS 18.1.\nCook said that while it may be difficult to project upgrade rates now, the company is \"very excited\" about the \"level of value\" Apple Intelligence is expected to bring users.\nApple Intelligence will run on iPhone 15 and newer devices, which could drive consumers to upgrade for the AI features.\nCook also reported Apple's installed user base reached a record high, in what could add fuel to the scale of a potential AI-driven upgrade cycle.\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 16 with iOS 18 in September, with AI capabilities to follow.\nAfter Apple reported record-high revenue from its services segment in the third quarter, the company said it expects double-digit growth to another record high in the fourth quarter.\nApple reported its services revenue climbed to $24.21 billion in the third quarter, up 14% from the year-ago period. By contrast, product sales grew about 1.6% as iPad and Mac sales rose, while iPhone sales declined close to 1%.\nThe company reported total revenue of $85.78 billion for the quarter, representing 5% year-over-year growth.\nDespite reporting a year-over-year drop in China sales, Cook said there were signs of improvement in the region compared to the first half of fiscal 2024, suggesting recent pricing discount efforts could be paying off.\nThe company reported a 6.5% year-over-year decline in sales in the China region, though Cook said around 3% was currency-related.\nCook said iPhone 15 sales since the device's launch were outperforming what the company recorded for the iPhone 14 in the greater China region, offering what could be a positive indicator ahead of the upcoming iPhone 16.\nApple shares were little changed in extended trading Thursday following the company's earnings call.

        "Title": "Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum",
        "Author": "  Kenio Fontes ",
        "Text": "While some tech companies are suffering a sell-off, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has fallen by 11% in the last 30 days, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has fallen by an even greater 16%, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has continued to advance and reached the $224 mark in the post-earnings period.\nThis new valuation level for Apple is justified by its responsibility for spreading artificial intelligence (or Apple Intelligence) technology through its strong user base and possible monetization from this, such as a better cycle for its hardware and maintaining the momentum of service revenue.\nApple maintaining this very premium valuation level is explained by its excellent earnings, which have highlighted a clearer scenario for the company.\nIn its third fiscal quarter, Apple delivered very strong indicators reinforcing its good prospects for the end of this fiscal year and the medium term. Net revenue was up 5%, driven by services and the resumption of growth in iPads and Macs. While the market expected revenue of around $84.40 billion, the reported figure was $85.50 billion. The tech giant also beat earnings per share projections, delivering $1.40 while estimates were $1.34.\nOverall, each key performance indicator surprised the market in a positive way. The company also recorded 24% year-over-year growth in iPad sales, 2% growth for Macs and the maintenance of very strong momentum for its services revenue.\nSource: App Economy Insights\nEven iPhone sales, which shrank by 1% but showed slight growth on a constant currency basis, show the continued strength and resilience of smartphones and confirm what was mentioned in the call that the iPhone 15 models continue to be chosen by consumers, with the Pro and Pro Max being able to use Apple Intelligence.\nWhile only the newest iPhones will be able to make full use of Apple Intelligence features, Macs with Apple Silicon since 2020 will have these features.\nOnce again, the positive highlight was the services segment, which reached $24.20 billion and paid subscriptions reaching an all-time high. In addition, the advertising, cloud and payments subsegments achieved all-time highs due to significant operational advances in Apple TV, Apple Pay, Maps and other features.\nOn the negative side were results in China, which fell by 6.50% and just under 3% in constant currency. Even if the risk of a slowdown in sales and the exchange rate risk persists, it may not be as severe as the installed base in the region has reached a new record, which may be a sign that the environment remains competitive, but with a greater level of stability.\nFinally, management's expectation is that in the fourth quarter, revenue will grow at the same rate as in the third, which was close to 5%. In addition, they believe the gross margin will be between 45.50% and 46.50%, which is also close to what was recorded last quarter. This guidance was higher than expected by Wall Street.\nIf we look only at momentum and the market's reaction to recent earnings, sentiment for Apple is bullish. Operationally, the company has returned to growth, continues to deliver good profitability indicators and its outlook for the AI narrative is excellent, with the main view being the company will offer (and possibly further popularize) these functionalities with its broad user base.\nAnd this is mainly revealed by the company's valuation. Apple's forward price-earnings ratio is 30, above its average of 26 over the last five years and very close to Microsoft, which trades at 31 times its net income. One of the things worth reflecting on is whether Apple really deserves the same award as Microsoft since its operations, although resilient and driven by services, still have a greater cyclicality, less recurrence and more timid growth prospects when compared to other big tech players.\nThis makes Apple's GF Value rank a low 3 out of 10, mainly due to multiples that exceed its own history and are in line with or slightly above the industry. Therefore, on the GF Value chart, Apple appears to be modestly overvalued, which makes a lot of sense in the current context.\nIn a discounted cash flow model using net income as a proxy, it can be seen that Apple shares really are not a bargain currently, but they are not extremely overvalued either. With very reasonable assumptions, such as average growth of 5% (Wall Street estimates), a net income margin of 27% (made possible by continued efficiency gains and a better mix between services and products) and terminal growth of 4% with a discount rate of 8%, we find a fair price of $193 for Apple, a downside of just over 10% that seems within the margin of error.\nSource: Alpha Spread\nDespite the very small margin of safety, the bright side is that as Apple is an excellent company. We are much more likely to see positive surprises than negative ones.\nIn other words, if Apple comes up with some new factor that boosts earnings (or the narrative that earnings are going up), this could continue to boost the stock.\nThe downside is that, in relative terms, Apple has lost some of its appeal due to the eroding margin of safety. When we think about increasing exposure to a particular stock, we must always consider the opportunity cost and other allocation possibilities.\nAs mentioned, while Apple shares rose post-earnings, Microsoft and Amazon experienced dips. This makes Amazon and Microsoft a much more rational buy at the moment based on the history of the last five years.\nAAPL Data by GuruFocus\nApple does not lose value because of this, but it makes it less attractive in relative terms since Amazon and Microsoft also have great prospects, large moats and will have a large share and benefit from the AI trend. For fiscal 2024, the consensus expects earnings per share growth of 9.33% year over year for Apple, Microsoft growth of 11.70% (for 2025) and Amazon growth of just over 60%. In other words, while they are all good prospects, Microsoft and Amazon stand out with promises of faster growth.\nI believe the third quarter was a tipping point for Apple. The company appears to have returned to growth (albeit below other big techs) and managed to catch up with its peers in the AI race, which makes the outlook for the medium and long term much better.\nThe downside is this comes with an expansion in multiples that greatly reduces the margin of safety. Even though the stock is not very overvalued, it makes it less attractive when compared to similar options from consolidated technology-related companies with large moats and exposure to the most important trends in the market such as the cloud and AI.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In the world of finance, 10 years is the blink of an eye. Want proof? Take a close look at the table below:\nCompany\n2014 Market Cap (in billions)\n2024 Market Cap (in billions)\nIBM\n$182\n$178\nNvidia\n$10\n$2,965\nIn August 2014, IBM's market cap was roughly 18 times larger than Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA). But oh, how the tables have turned. Today, Nvidia\u00a0boasts a market cap of about $3 trillion -- roughly 17 times larger than IBM.\nSo, looking ahead to the next 10 years, what are the companies that could surpass Apple's enormous market cap? Here are two that could pull it off.\nIf a company is going to surpass Apple over the next decade, it will need a gigantic market cap. Even assuming Apple's market cap holds steady, that would mean a company would need to reach a market cap of $3.4 trillion to catch Apple.\nThat's a very tall order, and there are only so many companies that could do it. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of them.\nFor starters, Microsoft already has a market cap of $3.1 trillion as of this writing. As recently as June, Microsoft did have a market cap larger than Apple. What's more, Microsoft holds a few competitive advantages that should, over time, help the company's market cap ease past Apple. \nFirst, Microsoft has a more diversified business. The company has its hands in cloud computing, gaming, advertising, hardware, software, social networking, and artificial intelligence (AI). In short, Microsoft has many pathways to success. Apple, on the other hand, has traditionally benefited from its excellent hardware innovation. And while Apple services and AI could boost the company's revenue, flagging iPhone sales could present a real challenge to Apple over the next decade.\nIn my book, that means an advantage for Microsoft. \nI have reservations about Nvidia right now. Its sky-high valuation makes it vulnerable to a nasty correction if the company's sales show any signs of slowing. That said, this article is about what could happen over the next 10 years. And in that case, I think Nvidia is well positioned to surpass Apple.\nThat's because Nvidia's core business -- making the graphics processing units (GPUs) that will power cutting-edge AI systems for the next decade -- is on a long-term growth trajectory that Apple simply can't match.\nSales of Apple's signature product -- the iPhone -- grew every year between 2007 and 2015, but they've been flat since then.\nNvidia, on the other hand, is still growing. Over the last two years, the company has tripled its revenue as GPUs have sold like hotcakes. That growth isn't likely to slow in the next few years. Most analysts expect Nvidia's sales to double again to around $160 billion by 2026.\nSure, there are likely to be some bumps in the road as the competitors take some market share from Nvidia in the red-hot AI chips market. But even if Nvidia's sales growth slows, it could easily close the $500 billion market cap difference between it and Apple over the next decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $758,227!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. predicted that its new artificial intelligence features will spur iPhone upgrades in coming months, helping the company reemerge from a sales slowdown that has hit its China business especially hard.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\nNew York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\nThe 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk\nParis Spent \u20ac1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked?\nNew York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook, speaking on a conference call Thursday to discuss third-quarter results, said that upcoming Apple Intelligence features will provide a fresh reason for customers to buy new phones.\n\u201cIt will be a very key time for a compelling upgrade cycle,\u201d he told analysts on the call.\nThe remarks followed generally upbeat third-quarter results that were marred by sluggish sales in China. Apple returned to revenue growth in the period, which ended June 29, with an increase of 5% to $85.8 billion. That beat the $84.5 billion analyst estimate.\nBut sales from China fell 6.5% to $14.7 billion, missing the $15.3 billion projection from Wall Street.\nApple\u2019s shares were virtually unchanged in premarket trading on Friday. They were down 0.1% at $218.10 at 4:56 a.m. New York time. The stock had gained 13% this year through the close, lifted by investors\u2019 hope that new artificial intelligence technology would help boost sales.\nThe China results rekindled fears that Apple is losing ground in one of its most important overseas markets. The company is up against fiercer competition in the region, and the government has reined in the use of foreign technology in some workplaces. Chinese economic growth also has worsened.\nApple attributed much of the decline to the impact of a strong dollar, saying that the underlying business in China is actually healthier than before. Three months ago, executives said the slowdown was less about an underperforming iPhone and more about weak sales of other products.\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\n\u201cWe do realize it\u2019s a very competitive smartphone market, but we feel we are doing quite well within the context of the broader economy,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Emily Chang.\nCook said during the call that Apple still has faith in the market. \u201cI don\u2019t know how every chapter of the book reads, but we\u2019re very confident in the long term,\u201d he said.\nSeptember Quarter\nApple said that total sales in the September quarter will grow at a similar level as the just-ended period, implying an increase of about 5%. Wall Street has projected a 4% clip. Services will be a highlight in the period, advancing in the double digits, executives said.\nEarnings amounted to $1.40 a share in third quarter, exceeding the $1.35 analysts had estimated. The period ending in June is typically one of Apple\u2019s slowest, coming at a time when many customers are waiting for the next iPhone to arrive in the fall.\nSales of Apple\u2019s flagship product, the iPhone, came in at $39.3 billion. Though the number was down slightly from a year earlier, it edged past Wall Street expectations. Three months ago, the company declined to forecast iPhone revenue for the June period \u2014 a signal it was still unsure about the shaky smartphone market.\niPad Comeback\nApple\u2019s iPad business benefited from the long-awaited release of new models. The company introduced major upgrades in May after a sluggish stretch for the tablet lineup. The new products included a pricier iPad Pro with an M4 chip, as well as a faster version of the iPad Air with a bigger-screen option.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company reported $7.16 billion in revenue from the category, up 24%. That beat the estimate of $6.6 billion. Apple previously said it expected the iPad to grow by a percentage in the double digits during the June period \u2014 something it easily accomplished. For several months, some customers and schools had been holding out on iPad purchases in expectation of the new models.\n\u201cAbout half the customers who purchased an iPad were new to the product,\u201d Maestri said.\nBeyond the new iPad Pro and iPad Air, Apple is working on versions of its entry-level iPad and iPad mini with faster processors. That could spur additional upgrades when they are released sometime in the coming months.\nApple Intelligence\nThe company also unveiled Apple Intelligence last quarter, showing off the new AI tools at its developers conference in June. But the technology \u2014 headed for the iPhone, iPad and Mac \u2014 isn\u2019t expected to be released to customers until October. Apple also hasn\u2019t yet explained how it plans to generate revenue from the features, beyond spurring demand for compatible devices. And the technology won\u2019t be available in China at the outset.\nThe services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Music and the TV+ streaming platform, continues to be a growth driver. It generated $24.2 billion in sales last quarter, up 14%.\nWall Street was looking for services revenue of just under $24 billion. Still, that business is under pressure from regulators who are seeking changes to the App Store, which they see as an anticompetitive force in the industry. That could ultimately limit Apple\u2019s ability to collect revenue from subscriptions and app downloads.\nMac revenue rose 2.5% to $7.01 billion, helped by the start of the back-to-school shopping season. That was in line with Wall Street predictions.\nApple hasn\u2019t made major changes to the Mac since the end of last year, but did add the M3 chip to the MacBook Air laptop in March. The computer line could be in for a boost later this year when Apple kicks off a shift to the more powerful M4 chip. The company is planning to update every Mac line with the new processor, which can better handle AI tasks, Bloomberg News has reported.\nWearables, Home and Accessories \u2014 a once high-flying category that includes AirPods, the Apple Watch, the company\u2019s TV set-top box, Beats headphones and HomePods \u2014 continued to struggle. That business brought in $8.1 billion in sales, down 2.3%. Still, that was better than the $7.8 billion estimate.\nApple only made minor changes to its most recent smartwatch lineup, and a patent dispute forced it to remove a blood-oxygen feature from some models. The company also hasn\u2019t updated its AirPods in several quarters.\nBut reinforcements are on the way: Apple is planning bigger displays for some watch models this fall, alongside a revamp to its low-end and mid-tier AirPods.\nThe upcoming iPhone 16 line should fuel a wave of demand. But the new models won\u2019t include major design changes. The company\u2019s iPhone 16 marketing pitch will be more about support for Apple Intelligence, faster processors, adding an Action button to the lower-end versions, and a camera-control button on the latest Pro models.\n(Adds share move in sixth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\nHow a Hip-Hop Pioneer Turned Breaking Into a Business\nForty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Sanghamitra Saha ",
        "Text": "Apple AAPL stock has gained 22.4% so far this year (as of Monday) and 26.1% in the past year. The company has been a laggard in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, but has picked up momentum of late.\nDaniel Loeb-backed Third Point hedge fund bet big on the stock, according to Street.com, on its latest AI initiative. Third Point started to buy Apple shares in April, and the stock was one of its portfolio's top five winners for the second quarter.\nLoeb also said that Apple\u2019s stock had become increasingly 'under-owned' by institutional investors, and its relative multiple had squeezed toward a multi-year low, despite Apple stock\u2019s recent run.\u00a0 In its second-quarter earnings report, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a huge reduction in its stake in Apple, citing high valuations, as quoted on Economic Times.\nShould You Play Apple Stock With ETFs?\nSince there still are uncertainties related to the success of Apple\u2019s upcoming AI rollout, it is better to track the company with the exchange-traded-fund (ETF) approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks. Apple-heavy ETFs include the likes of Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, iShares Global Tech ETF IXN and iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper into the stock\u2019s potential.\nApple's AI Initiative \nLoeb has previewed Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence feature, \"Apple Intelligence,\" as a gamechanger. The AI feature is set to launch in October with iOS 18. This feature looks to enhance Siri (Apple\u2019s original smartphone voice assistant), automate tasks like email generation and image sorting, and integrate advanced functions such as automated photo cleanup and ChatGPT. Loeb expects AI-driven growth to bolster revenues and earnings of Apple.\nApple has developed a new cloud service called Private Cloud Compute to ensure user privacy. This service uses Apple Silicon with built-in privacy capabilities that determine whether a request can be processed on device or needs cloud access. Apple has assured that no user information will be stored in the cloud.\nRecent Financial Performance of Apple\nApple reported robust third-quarter earnings, surpassing earnings per share and revenue estimates. While iPhone sales remain important, the iPad segment saw strong growth, indicating market expansion opportunities. However, challenges in Greater China impacted regional sales.\nBroker Rating for AAPL Stock\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated on the basis of actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 31 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.62 a month ago based on 30 recommendations.\nOf the 31 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 61.29% and 9.68% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 66.67%, while Buy represented 10%.\nPrice Target for AAPL Shares\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 31 analysts, the average price target for Apple stock comes to $241.68. The forecasts range from a low of $184.00 to a high of $300.00. The average price target represents an increase of 6.38% from the closing price of $227.18 recorded on Monday.\nAny Wall of Worry for Apple?\nApple\u2019s competitors have faced several AI hiccups before. Google\u2019s Bard provided incorrect answers, and its Gemini image generator displayed inaccurate images. Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+PC standard raised security concerns, while Meta faced criticism for not allowing users to disable its AI chatbot. Apple has always thrived on its reputation for security. Hence, any flaws in its generative AI efforts could harm its brand.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Author": "  Upwallstreet ",
        "Text": "On Thursday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its third quarter financials, revealing a YoY decline in iPhone sales and falling short of expectations in China.\nAlthough Apple CEO Tim Cook also acknowledged the rising costs of AI investments, the rise in Apple\u2019s capital expenditure is tiny compared to its mega-cap tech peers, such as\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and they are also growing at a much slower rate. When it comes to AI and a new era that is unfolding, Apple has a unique take on, as always.\nFor the quarter ended on June 29th, Apple reported revenue grew 5% YoY to $85.5 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$84.53 billion.\u00a0Revenue out of Greater China was $14.7 billion, a drop compared to last year\u2019s comparable quarter when the region brought in $15.2 billion.\u00a0Bloomberg were anticipating revenue of $15.2 billion.\u00a0iPhone remained the main revenue driver, making as much as 45% of total sales. But sales did slightly decline, more precisely 1% YoY to $39.2 billion, but still surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $38.81 billion. Services revenue that includes revenue from Google hit $24.2 billion as it grew 14% YoY and also topped LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of $24.01 billion.\niPad showed the strongest growth of almost 24% YoY as it brought in\u00a0$7.16 billion, topping LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of\u00a0\u00a0$6.61 billion estimated.\nWearables sales, however, declined to $8.1 billion\u00a0but still topped LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of\u00a0$7.79 billion\u00a0.\nMac revenue grew about 2% YoY to $7.01 billion\u00a0which came slightly short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$7.02 billion.\nAs for the bottom line, Apple posted a net income of\u00a0$21.45 billion and\u00a0\u00a0earnings per share of $1.40.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to play the game by increasing spending to avoid risking being left behind. With the AI spending spree, Zuckerberg also wants to ensure its big tech peers like Apple don\u2019t fully control the next tech era if it turns out to be AI. On the other hand, Apple is playing a different game.\u00a0Unlike Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Apple doesn\u2019t have a cloud business with which it rents out infrastructure to companies. Last week, Apple released the first version of its suite of AI features.\nIt plans to roll out its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence software to U.S. English users in the fall. Next year, it will \"proceed with more functionality, more features, and more languages and regions. The new software is expected to trigger a fresh iPhone sales supercycle and boost Apple\u2019s bottom line as\u00a0\u00a0the new software will only be compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and newer phones that will force iPhone owners of pre-15 models to upgrade if they want their hands on Apple\u2019s newest development.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Text": "By Supantha Mukherjee\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Apple will change how users choose browser options in the European Union, add a dedicated section for changing default apps, and make more apps deletable, the company said on Thursday.\nThe iPhone maker came under pressure from regulators to make changes after the EU's sweeping Digital Markets Act took effect on March 7, forcing it to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers on a \"choice screen\" the first time they open Safari.\nIn an update later this year, Apple users will be able to select a default browser directly from the choice screen after going through a mandatory list of options.\nA randomly ordered list of 12 browsers per EU country will be shown to the user with short descriptions, and the chosen one will be automatically downloaded, Apple said. The choice screen will also be available on iPads through an update later this year.\nApple released a previous update in response to the new rules in March, but browser companies criticized the design of its choice screen, and the Commission opened an investigation on March 25 saying it suspected that the measures fell short of effective compliance.\n\"We welcome Apple's updated choice screen, particularly as it precedes the upcoming iPhone launches,\" Andrew Frost Moroz, founder of Aloha browser, told Reuters.\n\"For those less familiar with us, the description will highlight these benefits, and fewer taps to start browsing will enhance the user experience and benefit third-party browsers,\" he said.\nApple said it has been in dialogue with the European Commission and believes the new changes will address regulators' concerns.\nThe Commission said on Thursday it will monitor the effectiveness of the solutions in achieving the objective of the DMA and will decide on the next steps in the open case.\nIt also plans to introduce a dedicated area for default apps where a user will be able to set defaults for messaging, phone calls, spam filters, password managers and keyboards.\nUsers will also be able to delete certain Apple-made apps such as App Store, Messages, Camera, Photos and Safari.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- With its hardware event on Tuesday, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is trying to outshine Apple\u2019s annual iPhone launch \u2014 and is letting longtime executive Rick Osterloh take center stage.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money\nBoston\u2019s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival\nA Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk\nThe Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\nOsterloh, the former president of Motorola who joined Google in 2016, will helm the first major product launch after the company this year unified under his leadership the teams developing hardware and the Android operating system. The reorganization expanded Osterloh\u2019s influence in the company and signaled that Google intends to compete in hardware for the long term.\nIn a sign of a more aggressive push into consumer devices, Google moved up its annual flagship Pixel smartphone launch to August from October, preempting the next Apple Inc. iPhone debut and seizing attention during a typically quiet period for the industry.\n\u201cFor the first time, I feel Alphabet is taking its hardware and the smartphone side pretty seriously,\u201d said Mandeep Singh, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThat is a reflection of Rick\u2019s leadership and what he has done.\u201d\nGoogle has invested heavily in its Pixel line, including designing its own chip, sponsoring NBA playoffs games and handing devices to superstar players like Giannis Antetokounmpo. And yet, it continues to trail Apple at the high end of the market. Android partner Samsung Electronics Co. has locked up much of the rest of that segment in the US, leaving little room for insurgents, even ones as influential as Google.\nTough competition hasn\u2019t slowed the rise of Osterloh\u2019s star within Google, and handing him unilateral control of the company\u2019s consumer offerings \u2014 at the expense of Hiroshi Lockheimer, who previously oversaw Android \u2014 may be a move to ensure Google can capitalize on the current push to monetize AI through devices.\n\u201cThe scope of Osterloh\u2019s role is considerable. It not only applies to Android but also other key platforms such as Chrome,\u201d said CCS Insight Chief Analyst Ben Wood. \u201cIt could signal the realization by Google it needs a more cohesive approach across platforms, particularly as the AI battle intensifies.\u201d\nThe latest wave of generative artificial intelligence features has the potential to revive consumer interest in smartphones and prompt them to upgrade their devices more regularly, Singh said. Samsung has positioned its Galaxy lineup as an AI-first offering this year, and it reported that its Galaxy S24 series notched double-digit sales growth over its predecessor. Apple has also signaled it intends to sell iPhones on the strength of a suite of new features it calls Apple Intelligence.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel line, which dates as far back as Osterloh\u2019s tenure with the company, has stood out due to its embrace of AI in its camera software. It\u2019s delivered groundbreaking advancements like Night Sight, a photography mode that\u2019s been emulated across the mobile industry, including by Apple. And Google\u2019s development of a Tensor mobile chip, designed in house, gives the company a differentiating feature against other Android contenders.\nBy holding its hardware showcase a month ahead of the iPhone maker\u2019s largest annual event, Google is \u201cfrontrunning Apple and also making a statement that we are likely way ahead of what Apple will show for iPhone 16 at least,\u201d Singh said. Google has at least a six-month head start on Apple, which has invested less in AI over the years than some of its Big Tech peers, he added.\nGoogle\u2019s strategy \u2014 tying together the development of hardware, software and services \u2014 carries echoes of Apple\u2019s successful approach to designing devices. Yet, as Osterloh seeks to capitalize on the opportunity presented by AI, he faces a perennial challenge for Google: bringing the fight to Apple without threatening key relationships with hardware giants such as Xiaomi Corp. that rely on the Android operating system.\nAndroid President Sameer Samat said in an interview that his team maintains strict information-sharing boundaries to ensure its projects with the Pixel team and partners such as Samsung don\u2019t bleed into one another. Yet the team\u2019s position under Osterloh\u2019s stewardship will smooth the path of Google\u2019s AI from labs to Android partners, Samat said.\n\u201cIt allows us to take some of our AI innovation and actually bring it to more of the ecosystem more quickly,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s all been about trying to move faster around our AI endeavor and improving the consumer experience.\u201d\nShortly after starting in his new role, Osterloh traveled to South Korea to meet his Samsung counterpart, TM Roh, to ensure the partnership and collaboration between the two companies continues smoothly. He also attended Samsung\u2019s Unpacked product launch event in July, promising to bring Google\u2019s AI-powered experiences \u201cto all Android devices.\u201d\nDue to the complexity of switching from Apple to Android devices, any gains Google makes in hardware are likely to come at the expense of Android partners, which could be a helpful force in and of itself, Singh said.\nIt will pressure those brands to \u201cmove faster,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAnd overall I think it will just strengthen Google\u2019s ecosystem.\u201d\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman and Davey Alba.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "Facing increasing pressure from regulators, Apple on Wednesday announced it's opening up NFC transactions to third-party developers. NFC, or near field communication, is the short-range wireless technology that powers Apple Pay and Wallet. Apple's exclusive access to the iPhone's NFC capabilities had been under investigation by the European Commission for years for restricting competition in the mobile payments space, leading Apple to ultimately open up its tap-and-go technology to third parties in the region.\nNow, Apple is broadening access to other markets, as well. According to its announcement, Apple will initially make its new NFC and Secure Element APIs available to developers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S., with additional locations to follow. The APIs will become available with the release of the iOS 18.1 update.\nAlthough Apple had long allowed third parties to access the contactless technology for things like reading NFC tags, the EU antitrust case pushed the company to allow competitors to access the iPhone's Secure Element tap-and-go mobile payments system. That decision saved Apple from facing an antitrust fine that would have been equal to up to 10% of its total annual revenue, or around $40 billion.\nAs other markets are taking cues from EU regulations, Apple is potentially getting ahead of any further complications by opening up NFC access to developers.\nWith the new APIs, developers will be able to offer competitive Wallet products, as well as other apps that offer in-app contactless transactions for things like in-store payments, car keys, closed-loop transit, corporate badges, student IDs, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty, reward cards and event tickets, with government IDs to be supported in the future. The expanded access will likely spark innovation as developers update their existing apps with new capabilities while others build apps to capitalize on the new functionality.\nDevelopers will still have to accept Apple's terms by entering into \"a commercial agreement with Apple,\" and the company hasn't yet said what that entails. The agreement will allow developers to request an entitlement and pay the associated fees, indicating this is not a freely available service.\nAfter gaining access, developers will be able to use the new APIs to access the Secure Element, a chip on the iPhone where sensitive information is stored safely on the device. Users will be able to open the third-party app directly or set it as the default in iOS settings to use it by way of the double-click on the side button, as you can today with Apple Pay.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/apple-opens-up-nfc-transactions-to-developers-but-says-there-will-be-associated-fees/\n"

There were also layoffs in other services teams, including the one that runs Apple News.\nApple Books has become less of a priority for the company, which doesn\u2019t see it as a major part of its services lineup. The Books app is still expected to get new features over time, according to the people. As for Apple News, the layoffs aren\u2019t a sign that it\u2019s becoming less of a focus, they said.\nLayoffs are relatively rare at Apple, though the company has made at least four rounds of reductions in 2024. Earlier this year, it laid off hundreds of workers when it shuttered its self-driving car project as well as an effort to make microLED displays. It also closed down a team in San Diego.\nA representative for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment on the cutbacks.\nServices have generally been a growth engine for Apple in recent years. They accounted for more than 22% of sales in the most recent fiscal year, up from less than 10% a decade ago, and the rise has helped cushion at-times sluggish demand for devices.\nMany of the cuts happened in the applications organization that is run by longtime Vice President Roger Rosner. Employees were told they\u2019d have 60 days to find another job within Apple before being terminated. Some of the employees worked across multiple teams, so other areas were tangentially affected as well.\nSome of Apple\u2019s Silicon Valley peers are shedding jobs in far greater numbers as they cope with slowing growth and a shift to artificial intelligence.

        "Text": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n View our latest analysis for Apple \nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Apple grew its EPS by 9.1% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Despite the relatively flat revenue figures, shareholders will be pleased to see EBIT margins have grown from 29% to 31% in the last 12 months. Which is a great look for the company.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Apple?\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$3.4t company like Apple. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$2.1b. This comes in at 0.06% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.\nOne positive for Apple is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Apple that you need to be mindful of.\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said the US government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit accusing the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market \u201cbears no relation to reality\u201d and should be tossed out by a federal judge.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinger Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice\nNew York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\nThe 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk\nParis Spent \u20ac1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked?\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\nIn a court filing, Apple denied allegations that it is a monopolist and said it is not required to give software developers more access to iPhones than they currently have. The company has set the terms for access to its own platform and technologies, Apple argued in its filing, but hasn\u2019t interfered or restricted third parties from dealing with its smartphone rivals. Those actions can\u2019t be challenged under US antitrust law, the company said.\n\u201cApple faces robust competition from other smartphone manufacturers around the world, including Google and Samsung,\u201d company lawyers argued Thursday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.\nThe suit against the world\u2019s most-valuable company came as the Biden administration made competition a cornerstone of its economic policy, with a primary focus on Silicon Valley. Apple, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. also face possible hefty fines as the European Union investigates their compliance with strict new laws reining in the power of Big Tech.\nIn its motion to dismiss the US case, Apple argued the complaint fails to demonstrate that the company\u2019s conduct has harmed consumers \u2014 a key component of antitrust cases.\n\u201cIt is implausible to claim, as the government does, that Apple has deterred any customers from switching to Google or Samsung because of its policies with respect to \u2018super apps,\u2019 cloud gaming, smartwatches, or anything else,\u201d according to the filing.\nIn March, the US Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general sued Apple for allegedly blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices. The suit alleges Apple used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. Antitrust enforcers alleged the company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services.\n\u201cThe implausibility of the government\u2019s claim that Apple\u2019s conduct has eroded smartphone competition is underscored by the complaint\u2019s implicit recognition that the smartphone market exhibits ongoing innovation and vigorous competition,\u201d according to Apple\u2019s filing.\nIn addition to the competition Apple faces from other smartphone makers, \u201cthird-party developers are flourishing on Apple\u2019s platform, offering iPhone users a wide range of competitive choices,\u201d the company said.\nCompanies typically ask judges to dismiss antitrust cases, though they rarely succeed in cases brought by the government.\nUS District Judge Julien Neals, an appointee of President Joe Biden who joined the bench in 2021, is likely to hold a hearing on Apple\u2019s request to dismiss the case later this year.\nThe case is US v Apple, 24-cv-04055, US District Court, District of New Jersey.\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\n(Updates with details of filing)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\nForty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest\nThe Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Cook\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand and we set an all-time revenue record in services, which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple intelligence built on years of innovation and investment in AI and machine learning. It will transform how users interact with technology from writing tools to help you express yourself to image playground which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating Chad GPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence, and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens and exploring entire world with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films and more, and we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We're doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year over year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the photo's app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3 Power 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus, and small business owners, developers and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple's silicon with its Neural Engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI, and every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020 is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with macOS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises, so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year over year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11- and 13-inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment and so much more. And with the new iPad Pro, we push the boundaries, a power-efficient performance with the remarkable in four chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, video editors and musicians can take advantage of the cutting-edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPro Air models powered by the M series of Apple's silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple intelligence. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple watch, our powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most from a regular heart rhythm notifications, to walking steadiness, to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieved revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in Advertising, Cloud and Payment Services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens, large and small. We're showing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the upcoming Disclaimer and the Instigator starring Matt Damon, and we can't wait for returning fan favorites when new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2300 nominations and 500 wins today. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs, our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded tap-to-pay on iPhone to more markets, including Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US National Park hikes and custom walk roots and Apple Maps, the ability to Pay with Rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listing with Apple Music and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditation. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro in demos that delight, inspire and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of special computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone, and in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye-tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music and vocal shortcuts that tie test to a user's boys. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users, with everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third parties from tracking you across the Internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy, At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's while we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year over year despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year over year with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially, driven by a different mix within products, which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable cost. Services gross margin was 74%, down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year over year. Net income was $21.4 billion. Diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year over year and set a June quarter record, and operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was$ 39.3 billion, down 1% year over year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We said June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia and the Philippines. And the iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Burbank, China, the UK, Germany, Australia and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year over year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets with June quarter records for MAC in Latin America, India and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac, and customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year over year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPod Air. Customers are loving the latest iPod lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad installed base has continued to grow and is an all-time high as half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and Air Pods continued to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the Air Pods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services as the growth of our installed base of active devices sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem, and we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings, both transacting accounts and paid accounts reaching a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year over year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over $1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+, to new games on Apple Arcade and the remaining latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company who recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. An American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of $139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind. It will have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year over year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market or minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator\nErik Woodring, Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe, Tim, if we start with you, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today? Where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are? And what that translates to in potential pent-up demand as we enter new iPhone cycle? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTimothy Cook\nYes, Hi, Erik. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter. And so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency and 15, as you point out -- if you look at that same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult, mid cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited and about the level of value that we're going to provide to users, we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.\nErik Woodring\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then secondly, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit. Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole? How much you believe promotions helped in the quarter? How sustainable this improvement is? And if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward? Thanks so much.\nTimothy Cook\nYes, Eric, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year over year for the whole of Greater China. And if you looked at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year over year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year. And so, we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone, in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal. And in fact, the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15-family compared to the 14-family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of '23. If you if you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the some of the color I would provide. I In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time -- buying that product for the first time, and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying the product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long term.\nErik Woodring\nGreat. Thanks so much.\nTimothy Cook\nYeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThank you, Eric. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nBen Reitzes, Melius.\nBenjamin Reitzes\nHey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Hey, Tim. You know, now that you've launched or announced Apple Intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services? Would it -- you feel like it will accelerate your services business augmented and maybe you folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nTimothy Cook\nWe started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers. So some of the features are out there as of Monday, and we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously that this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we're taking this first step in getting the beta out there. And we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.\nBenjamin Reitzes\nOkay, thanks. And then, Luca, with regard to gross margin, it's been -- you know there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you're managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri\nSure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. The total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially. And it was really driven by a different mix within products. Of course, you know, we launched a very important product like the iPad during the course of the quarter, but we had an offset from a shift in mix towards services and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on year over year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding [45.5% to 46.5%] which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again, similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that's what you're referring to, yes, we've seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel we are well positioned. And as you know, well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us, and we're pleased where we are.\nBenjamin Reitzes\nHey, thanks a lot.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nMike Ng, Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Ng\nHi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for and iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max model since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?\nTimothy Cook\nWe just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too early to tell.\nMichael Ng\nThat's fair. And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you're expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.\nTimothy Cook\nWe are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it's another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer, but I believe it will be a very key time for an compelling upgrade cycle.\nMichael Ng\nGreat. Thank you, Tim.\nTimothy Cook\nYeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThanks, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please.\nOperator\nAmit Daryanani, Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani\nGood afternoon, everyone, and off to as well. I guess maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic, there's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean to them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers or do you think they end of getting staggered a bit. And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next generation iPhone?\nTimothy Cook\nThe rollout, as we mentioned in June, we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year. And there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. And chat GPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, it is a staggered launch.\nAmit Daryanani\nGot it. And then your services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and seems like it's accelerated recently. Can you just touch and talk about it. When you look at the double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus, you know, better [RPU] or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?\nLuca Maestri\nYes, Amit, it's Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important, of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter. So more people using the ecosystem, both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters now. We look at our paid subscriptions on our platform and they're growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an RPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we're doing also very good job at improving the quality of the services and improving the amount of content that we may make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows new games all the time, and I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We're very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because particularly if you look at the performance that we had in services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThanks, Amit. And operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator\nWamsi Mohan, Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan\nYes, thank you. So much. Tim, you announced Apple intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners, but you're obviously there leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple intelligence part, the services growth from Apple intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I will follow up.\nTimothy Cook\nI think you know, the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal contact and then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge. As I said, and so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they're confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important, people want both.\nWamsi Mohan\nThanks, Tim. As a follow-up, maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again, if I look at calendar '23, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far would be more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwinds? I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri\nYeah. Of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be, and this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it's one of those things that is outside of our control. We tried to hedge our exposures, but it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. Are the other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the products business, our products have different margins profiles. And depending on their relative success in the marketplace, our products gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, you know, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products will be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as a first order of priority and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact the significant impact is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we'll see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business and we think we are in a good position there.\nWamsi Mohan\nThanks, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThanks, Wasmi. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nKrish Sankar, TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca, Tim, we keep hearing about is increasing silicon content for AI edge devices? And also, I think, Luca, you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for this new AI devices. And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware upgrades than what we have today. And then I had a quick follow-up.\nTimothy Cook\nMaybe I'll take the first -- the second first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, be the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same. And so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.\nLuca Maestri\nAnd from a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter, and we just provided guidance for the fourth quarter of 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. So we take it quarter-by-quarter, and we will report as the time goes by.\nKrish Sankar\nGot it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up with Tim. Thanks for the color on China. You also seen many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about in China? And I think, Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related? Or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\nTimothy Cook\nCertainly the competitive environment, there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before, and that remains to be the case. The macro economic factors have been in the press, too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing and we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThank you, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nDavid Vogt, UBS.\nDavid Vogt\nGreat. Two, if I may also, Tim, first one for you. I know it's early days and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instincts, say in terms of are these going to be additive applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think is lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\nTimothy Cook\nIf you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or deploying Apple Intelligence, we really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. And so we've thought about it from notes to mail to messages and all the rest. And so there's been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user in a way that will, I think get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think it's profound and you know we'll see what the developers do, but we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing. Yeah.\nDavid Vogt\nYes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybeI know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter. It sounds like with services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year, ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri\nWell, we have provided, let me repeat what we provided. We think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right? In spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.\nDavid Vogt\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThank you, David. And Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nAtif Malik, Citi.\nAtif Malik\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligent software features like notifications summary and reduced reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. So are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially part of iOS 19 next year?\nTimothy Cook\nOur objective that we said in June is to rollout US English starting in the fall, and that's to users and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a timeframe that and we're tracking to that.\nAtif Malik\nUnderstand. The next one for Luca. Luca the services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rules?\nLuca Maestri\nWell, as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It is obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.\nAtif Malik\nVery helpful. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri\nThank you, Atif. Operator, may we have the next question, please.\nOperator\nSamik Chatterjee, JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just come ask you about Apple Intelligence as well on the regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies, you mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the time lines you're thinking. How you're thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process in particular like you EU and maube China? And does in terms of your time lines of the rollout? Are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? How should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTimothy Cook\nWe are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.\nSamik Chatterjee\nOkay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.\nTimothy Cook\nYeah, I'll take that one. And I think the important thing to remember when you look at the wearables home and accessory categories is that we have a difficult launch compare and we've been running that for a few quarters. And we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it's important to keep that in mind if you sort of take a step back, however, and look at the business across the trailing 12-months, it's grown -- the wearables, home and accessory business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.\nSamik Chatterjee\nThank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThank you, Samik. Operator, may we have the last question, please?\nOperator\nRichard Kramer, Arete Research.\nRichard Kramer\nThanks very much, Tim you referenced the investment in innovation and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the services usage as they roll out given that they're so new for consumers? Thanks.\nTimothy Cook\nI Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We've been investing in AI and ML for years and in addition to investing more and we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth is sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here. It's increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it's important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach where we do things internally. And we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean, you can expect that there's -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.\nRichard Kramer\nOkay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they're up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the services mix or cost controls is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business.\nLuca Maestri\nYeah. I'm glad you noticed that we are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we have increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter this one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up -- on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.\nRichard Kramer\nOkay, thanks.\nTimothy Cook\nThank you, Richard.

But Chet Kapoor, chairman and CEO of AI company DataStax, has the distinct pleasure of being in a rarified group.\nDuring his time at the computer company NeXT from 1989 to 1993, which Steve Jobs founded in 1985 and sold to Apple (AAPL) in 1997, Kapoor was the self-professed \u201cperson that got coffee for the person that made coffee.\"\nKapoor said he learned lessons that stayed with him well into his leadership career.\n\u201dThere were so many things that I saw [from Steve] that I\u2019ve incorporated into what I do, what I\u2019ve done over the last 30 years,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above).\nThe former IBM (IBM) and Google (GOOG) exec says in business, inspiration is rarely a problem, but actually reaching innovation is hard. Pushing people to innovate and sweat the details is what Jobs did best.\n\u201cInnovation doesn\u2019t happen by saying please go out and do this, you have to push people and get them to a place where they will deliver on something they didn\u2019t think they could deliver on,\" Kapoor said.\nBefore Jobs died in 2011 from complications tied to pancreatic cancer, he was considered an inspiration and mentor to many in the business and tech fields. Despite his illness, he continued to innovate on products such as the iPad and iPhone.\nThat drive at any cost highlights one of the many lessons Kapoor picked up from working near Jobs in the office.\n\u201cHe always got up in the morning thinking about what people needed, not what people wanted,\" Kapoor added.\nNoting that consumers would be stuck with BlackBerry (BB) technology or Nokia (NOK) phones without Jobs, Kapoor stressed Jobs's \u201crelentless obsession for what people needed\" is something that still influences Kapoor's own work.\nKapoor also praised Jobs for his dedication to changing the world.\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s about making a dent on the universe,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned from Steve [to ask], \u2018Are you changing the world? Are you really thinking about it from the user\u2019s perspective, from a societal perspective, and going off and making that happen?\u201d he asked.\nThe ability to put those questions to work is part of what inspires Kapoor.\n\u201cI love building product businesses that developers love, the products that developers love, and change the trajectory of the enterprises that they work for,\u201d he said.\nAnother valuable lesson that comes courtesy of Jobs is making \u201csure you are very clear on what you\u2019re doing this for,\u201d said Kapoor. \u201cA lot of people in Silicon Valley get stuck where they actually build really cool tech. But the problem is it\u2019s technology. It\u2019s a solution looking for a problem.\u201d\nToday, Apple is the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $3.43 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data. The company is entering the AI age while raking in billions of dollars each day on the back of Jobs's creations.\nAs for the privately held DataStax, it has raised a solid $305 million in capital to support its growth plans. The company's last reported valuation stood at $1.6 billion following a $115 million capital raise in 2022.\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Apple will host its fall event on Sept. 9 at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, according to an invite on Monday, where it will likely unveil a series of new iPhones and updates to other devices and apps.\nThe upcoming launches are crucial for Apple as it looks to reverse a global sales slowdown, particularly in China, and lay out its artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.\nAt its developers conference in June, Apple announced a slew of AI features under the umbrella \"Apple Intelligence\", including a revamped Siri and an integration with ChatGPT.\nHowever, these features will be available only on the latest Apple devices and will be rolled out gradually starting later this year.\nApple faces increasing pressure from competitors such as Samsung and Alphabet's Google, who have recently announced AI functionality alongside their new Galaxy and Pixel smartphones, respectively.\nWhile Apple's event invite teases \"It's Glowtime,\" no further details have been provided. The company typically announces new iPhones and watches at the fall event, its biggest product showcase every year.\nIn recent years, iPhone sales have slowed due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices.\nApple has said its third-quarter sales were better than expected on the back of iPhone 15, its latest series, which is set to receive the new AI features. Overall sales in China dropped more than expected at 6.5%, pressured by Chinese smartphone brands, chiefly Huawei.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri and Tasim Zahid)\n"

        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) -Apple on Thursday asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit by federal and state antitrust regulators accusing it of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market, saying the case would have a judge redesign its popular iPhone.\nThe Justice Department, 19 states and Washington, D.C., accuse Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.\nIn a motion filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Apple argued that putting reasonable limitations on third-party developers' access to its technology did not amount to anti-competitive behavior, and forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation.\n\"Endorsing such a theory would require courts to oversee product-design and policy choices in dynamic technical markets,\" Apple said.\nThe lawsuit filed in March takes aim at Apple's restrictions and fees on app developers, and technical roadblocks to third-party devices and services -- such as smart watches, digital wallets and messaging services -- that would compete with its own.\nThe Justice Department says that by hampering interoperability between the iPhone and third-party apps and devices, Apple locks users into its own products and harms competition in the market.\nBut Apple argued that the lawsuit fails to raise any evidence that its practices harm competition or consumers, who it says plausibly switch to a competitor if they dislike what iPhone features.\nU.S. District Judge Julien Neals, who is overseeing the case, will receive a response from the government and a reply from Apple before deciding the motion later this year.\nThe case is one of five blockbuster monopoly cases pending against Big Tech companies.\nFacebook parent Meta Platforms and Amazon.com are facing lawsuits by antitrust enforcers alleging they illegally maintain monopolies, and Alphabet's Google is facing two such lawsuits.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New YorkEditing by Chris Reese and Leslie Adler)\n"

        "Title": "Some European users will get access to Apple Intelligence after all",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "Turns out Apple will bring its \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d AI to Europe after all\u2014though only to a relatively small subset of its userbase.\nApple said in late June that it would not roll out Apple Intelligence to EU users because of the interoperability requirements in Europe\u2019s new Big Tech antitrust law, the Digital Markets Act, which it said \u201ccould force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.\u201d\nHowever, not every Apple platform is designated as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d under the DMA\u2014the status that brings with it those interoperability requirements. iOS and iPadOS are both classed as gatekeeper platforms, as are the Safari browser and the App Store, but MacOS is not. Which probably explains why, as 9to5Mac reports, Apple\u2019s release notes for the beta version of the upcoming MacOS Sequoia 15.1 operating system say only that the new AI features will be unavailable in China; there\u2019s no mention of Europe, unlike in the equivalent release notes for the iOS 18.1 beta.\nFrom a purely practical point of view, this distinction (which I have asked Apple to confirm; no response yet) would let the company at least get some idea of how European users are responding to the AI features, even if there are about 20 times as many iPhone and iPad users in the EU as there are Mac users.\nBut I\u2019m still somewhat amazed that Apple seems set to forego the extra sales of this year\u2019s iPhone that it would achieve if European buyers could get the AI features only that device (and last year\u2019s iPhone Pro and Pro Max) can support. There simply isn\u2019t as much reason to upgrade without that part of the pitch.\nThe fact is, we still don\u2019t know what Apple\u2019s problem is with the DMA\u2019s interoperability requirements, a month and a half after Apple made its announcement.\nAt the time, I dismissed Apple\u2019s statement with the rather inadequate observation that those requirements focus on messaging. That is one of the focuses, but the DMA also says that Apple would have to let third-party hardware and services tap into the same virtual assistant-controlled iOS features that Apple\u2019s own chatbot can control\u2014and this is where one can more easily imagine some kind of security or privacy issue coming up.\nBut imagining is all we can do, as neither Apple nor the European Commission (which enforces the DMA) is explaining the precise problem\u2014the scenario to help us understand exactly how the DMA poses a threat to the safety of Apple Intelligence users (or does not).\nFor the Commission, this is supposedly a matter of policy. \u201cWe do not comment on individual decisions of companies,\u201d a spokesperson said in a canned reply to my questions today. Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has previously claimed that Apple\u2019s inability to achieve antitrust compliance means \u201cthey know 100%\u201d that their strategy for rolling out Apple Intelligence \u201cis another way of disabling competition.\u201d\nIf it can, Apple should hit back at this characterization with some specificity about the security threats it\u2019s trying to ward off.\nAfter all, Apple often cries \u201cbut security\u201d when regulators tell it to be less closed, and the sky still hasn\u2019t fallen in as a result of, say, the DMA forcing Apple to allow third-party iOS app stores in Europe. As things stand, one must give some credence to Vestager\u2019s accusation that the company is effectively saying \u201cwe will now deploy AI where we\u2019re not obliged to enable competition.\u201d That claim is in itself annoyingly vague, but if it\u2019s not accurate, Apple needs to explain why.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

They see this as the beginning of a new, multi-faceted AI revenue stream that will encompass both hardware and software.\n\"We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front and adds $30 to $40 per share,\" the note states.\nWedbush maintained an Outperform rating on Apple stock and the price target of $285.\nRelated Articles\nWedbush: This iPhone upgrade cycle could set stage for Apple supercycle\nEarnings call: Marpai reports Q2 2024 financial results and turnaround progress\nEarnings call: Adams Resources & Energy sees mixed Q2 results, eyes Q3 rebound\n"

        "Title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s sale of 510 million Apple shares will go down as one of the best bets of his career",
        "Author": "  Shawn Tully ",
        "Text": "Starting in Q1 of 2024, Warren Buffett epically downsized his immense holdings of Apple stock in one of the best-publicized selloffs by any famous investor in recent memory. In the past two quarters, the Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway has sold roughly 510 million of the iPhone-maker's shares, lightening its holdings by around 56%. The size and suddenness of the exit stirred speculation that Buffett's optimism for Apple's stock had faded following the fantastic run over the past seven years\u2014a surge that Buffett timed and rode to near-perfection.\nIt's important to note that Apple remains Berkshire's biggest equity holding, comprising 41% of the conglomerate's portfolio. At the annual meeting in May, Buffett's admiration for Apple appeared undimmed. He declared that two of his long-time prized investments, Coca-Cola and American Express, were \"wonderful\" businesses, but that lauded Apple as \"an even better one.\"\nBuffett isn't saying why he shed such a large portion of his Apple stake, and we simply don't we don't know whether, going forward, he'll maintain a giant position in what's still the world's most valuable enterprise. What's clear is that overall, he's taking a far more defensive position in a pricey market. Berkshire sold $90 billion in stocks in the first half of 2024, the Apple dump accounting for the vast bulk of the proceeds.\nThat downshift raised Berkshire's cash holdings from the previous record of $189 billion at the close of Q1, to $278 billion. As disclosed in its 10Q, Berkshire further swelled its war chest in July by selling around $4 billion in shares of Bank of America, in recent years its second largest holding, and a stock that like Apple, Buffett bought on the cheap that's proven a fabulously profitable bet. Buffett's now amassed new loads of extra cash for channeling into beaten-down choices that look as enticing as Apple or Bank of America did years ago.\nIt's hard to find a better case of \"selling high\" than Buffett's Apple gambit. Examining the trajectory of colossus of Cupertino's profit and valuation numbers, it's clear that the shares have run from a screaming bargain (PE of 16) when Buffett bought them to dangerously expensive (PE of 32) by the time he began taking profits in a big way. Apple's stock price has reached such a dizzying summit that the current shareholders, or folks and funds who buy now, stand little chance of reaping double-digit returns in the years ahead. And the currently super-elevated valuation means that a major correction is far more likely now than, say, just before the pandemic's outbreak, when Apple fetched one-third today's price.\nHowever it's interesting that Buffett missed the \"top tick\" on Apple shares. They ended Q2 at $211\u2014the close of Berkshire's selling period\u2014before ramping 12% to a record $235 on July 16. Since then, Apple's been caught in the maelstrom that's roiling the Magnificent Seven, a battering that as of August 8, sent shares back to $211 where it started the quarter. News of the Berkshire unloading three days earlier was a big contributor to Apple's fall.\nBut American champion's the victim not of poor performance, but overheated expectations and excessive enthusiasm from the markets. Buffett saw in 2016 that the outlook on Apple was far too dour, and made one of the great wagers of his career. It made eminent sense to harvest much of those fabulous gains, and soften the hit if as is likely, Apple's fans are expecting far, far too much.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Calculating The Fair Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The projected fair value for Apple is US$240 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$216 share price, Apple appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\nOur fair value estimate is 2.1% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$235\nDoes the August share price for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n View our latest analysis for Apple \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$123.7b\nUS$134.9b\nUS$163.8b\nUS$177.5b\nUS$188.0b\nUS$197.2b\nUS$205.5b\nUS$213.0b\nUS$220.1b\nUS$226.8b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x10\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 5.92%\nEst @ 4.89%\nEst @ 4.18%\nEst @ 3.67%\nEst @ 3.32%\nEst @ 3.07%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% \nUS$115.3k\nUS$117.2k\nUS$132.6k\nUS$134.0k\nUS$132.3k\nUS$129.4k\nUS$125.6k\nUS$121.4k\nUS$116.9k\nUS$112.3k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$227b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.5%) = US$4.9t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.9t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.4t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.6t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$216, the company appears about fair value at a 9.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.160. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

The controls, which are live now in Addigy MDM, give IT admins and MSPs the ability to test enabling and disabling Apple Intelligence across their devices before AI is embedded in the public fall OS releases. This pre-zero-day (pre-Apple AI launch) support exemplifies the company\u2019s unique commitment to helping customers prepare for new Apple developments, including its next-generation declarative device management protocol, while ensuring device security and compliance.\nApple has stated that macOS 15, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18 and their later versions will include Apple Intelligence. To help enterprise customers address potential data security and compliance concerns, these OSes will also include features for disabling AI on devices, as well as preventing end users from enabling it. To use these functions, businesses must have a Mobile Device Management solution.\n\"While Apple Intelligence is an exciting development, many organizations are rightly concerned about potential impacts. Some don\u2019t allow AI on devices.

But the agency is withdrawing the probe report after Apple protested that it contained sensitive, privileged information, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing non-public discussions.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the regulator can now seek to revive the probe, which would likely require restarting the process. As a next step, the CCI could release a copy of the report which omits the confidential information. All of this would effectively delay the matter at the regulator.\nThe privileged information which Apple shared with the director general of investigation includes business data such as India sales numbers which the company does not publicly disclose, according to another person who is aware of the matter. The details were provided to help with the probe and were intended to be private.\nRepresentatives for the watchdog didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for a comment while Apple declined to comment.\nTech giants are grappling with growing scrutiny from regulators around the world, who accuse Apple and its peers of unfairly sustaining their dominance of markets from mobile apps to content. The India probe focused on Apple\u2019s billing practices in the mobile apps market, where it competes against rivals such as Google.\nApple is defending its app policies on multiple fronts, including a lawsuit at home in the US and via challenges in Europe, South Korea and Japan. It has consistently argued its commissions are justified by the security and peace of mind that the app store provides users, while giving developers a global showcase.\nIn India, the company controls just a single-percentage share of the 690 million-strong smartphone market, which is led by other foreign brands. Reuters first reported the recall of the probe report Tuesday and the findings of the investigation, which were not public and shared only internally with regulators, last month.\nBut the country is increasingly an important manufacturing base for Apple, which is seeking to lessen its reliance on China at a time of escalating geopolitical tensions.\n--With assistance from Shruti Srivastava and Ville Heiskanen.\n(Updates with details on privileged information in fourth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

As a result, index providers calculated the tech company\u2019s weight based on a methodology known as float-adjusted market capitalization.\nPut simply, Apple\u2019s true value is not reflected in many indexes.\nIn percentage terms, the numbers don\u2019t seem huge \u2014 in the case of the S&P 500, for instance, 94% of Apple\u2019s value is currently considered. That should now increase to 100%, according to Piper Sandler & Co. But in a $3 trillion company, it adds up.\nIn the wake of Berkshire\u2019s sale, passive funds tracking these indexes may now have to buy as much as $40 billion of Apple stock when they next rebalance, according to Piper Sandler\u2019s estimates. That\u2019s triple the average daily trading volume of the company\u2019s shares over the past month.\nIndex funds robotically stepping-in to replace another investor in one of the megacaps will offer ammunition to critics like David Einhorn, who argue passive investing has \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d the markets by making so much money value-insensitive. More immediately, it\u2019s bad news for some other companies in the gauges, whose weights will be reduced to accommodate the change and whose shares will be sold by funds accordingly.\nThe first revisions won\u2019t take place until the quarterly index rebalance due next month, and for now at least any shuffling looks secondary for a market that\u2019s fixated on economic growth and central bank policies. But there is a cohort of traders who take positions in anticipation of events like this.\n\u201cWe often see activity due to rebalances on our desk,\u201d said Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler\u2019s chief investment strategist. \u201cPeople want to be aware of it.\u201d\nA spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices referred Bloomberg News to its index methodology and declined to comment further.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nNew Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas)\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett, the legendary investor known as the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d (and \u201cFireball\u201d by his father), is famous for his smart investment choices. So when it was revealed that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, sold half its Apple shares, many investors were puzzled, trying to understand what it meant.\nDon't Miss:\nThis startup\u2019s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing \u2014 Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors.\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nDon\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\nIs it all just a coincidence, or is there more to it? Some experts think Buffett prefers round numbers, so stopping at 400 million shares might not be a big deal. Others see Buffett positioning Apple as a key, long-term investment, similar to how he views Coca-Cola.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway sold over 100 million Apple shares, and in the second quarter, they sold an additional 390 million shares. Despite this sell-off, Apple is still Berkshire Hathaway's largest public investment, with around 400 million shares worth nearly $90 billion.\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nHere are the top five Berkshire Hathaway holdings as of June 30, 2024:\nApple (AAPL)\nShares held: 400,000,000\nHolding value: $84,248,000,000\nPercent of portfolio: 30.52%\nBank of America (BAC)\nShares held: 942,429,882\nHolding value: $37,225,980,339\nPercent of portfolio: 13.48%\nAmerican Express (AXP)\nShares held: 151,610,700\nHolding value: $35,105,457,585\nPercent of portfolio: 12.72%\nCoca-Cola (KO)\nShares held: 400,000,000\nHolding value: $25,460,000,000\nPercent of portfolio: 9.22%\nChevron (CVX)\nShares held: 118,610,534\nHolding value: $18,553,059,728\nPercent of portfolio: 6.72%\nTrending: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nHis Apple sell-off is surprising, as Buffett has always been a huge fan of Tim Cook, Apple, and their products. We could hear him talking about how much he admires the company's loyal customer base. He even once said that people would give up their cars before they gave up their iPhones.\nBesides, the last time BH sold a large amount of Apple stocks, Charlie Munger, his longtime partner, told him, \u201cThat was probably a mistake.\u201d So, why would he sell such a large portion of Apple shares now?\nTrending: Unlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million.\nBuffett\u2019s move to sell a big portion of Apple stock is similar to how he handled his investment in Coca-Cola. Years ago, he bought many Coca-Cola shares and has kept them for decades, even after the stock split. Now, he owns 400 million shares of both Apple and Coca-Cola, which has some people thinking that this number might mean he\u2019s finished selling Apple and plans to keep it as a long-term part of his portfolio.\nInterestingly, even as Buffett was selling Apple, other big investors doubled down on the stock. For example, Jennison Associates, a firm managing over $200 billion, added more than 11 million Apple shares in the second quarter. William Jones Wealth Management also increased its Apple holdings by 35,000 shares. On the other hand, some firms, like Coatue Management and Cerity Partners, followed Buffett\u2019s lead by reducing their Apple positions.\nWhatever the reason, Buffett's latest move with Apple stock again made one thing clear: when Warren Buffett makes a move, the market pays attention.\nRead Next:\nWhen today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out.\nThis startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry \u2013 Here\u2019s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Is It A Sign?

        "Text": "Few stocks boast a pedigree as impressive as Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL). Not only is the consumer technology giant the first publicly traded outfit to reach a trillion-dollar market cap, it's also often the world's most profitable company. It has earned its status as an investor favorite.\nApple's stock has split several times since its initial public offering back in 1980, of course. It essentially had to, in order to accommodate the organization's incredible growth.\nAnd that raises a curious question: If you bought one share of Apple at its IPO, how many would you own now?\nApple's stock has been split five times since going public in December 1980. The first was 1987's 2-for-1 split, followed by another 2-for-1 split in mid-2000. The next split came in early 2005...another 2-for-1 deal.\nThen the party really started. Following the explosive revenue growth driven by 2007's debut of the iPhone, Apple shares saw a 7-for-1 split in mid-2014 and underwent a 4-for-1 split again in mid-2020.\nCrunching the numbers, one share of Apple back in 1980 would have become 224 shares today. Adjusting for all of these splits, the stock's IPO price of $22 per share is effectively dialed back to $0.10.\nApple's is an extremely unusual case, of course. Most stocks don't need to be split as much as this one's been.\nNevertheless, not every stock needs to do as well from its inception to make you very, very wealthy. One or two of these mega-winners will do the trick. The challenge is just figuring out which companies have true long-term growth potential and which ones don't. For every winner like Apple, there seems to be a handful of disappointing names like Blue Apron or Groupon. Take your shots, but be discerning and realistic as well.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) reported its second-quarter earnings a couple of weeks ago, investors learned that CEO Warren Buffett and his team sold a large portion of its massive stake in tech-giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). However, investors didn't know exactly how much Apple stock Berkshire sold and still owned.\nBerkshire only reported that it owned $84.2 billion in Apple stock as of June 30. By using the stock price as of that date, it appeared that Berkshire sold \"about half\" of its Apple stock.\nNow, investors know the exact number. According to Berkshire's latest 13-F filing, the company sold 389,368,450 shares of Apple in the second quarter. Berkshire currently owns exactly 400,000,000 shares of the big-tech giant.\nInvestors don't know the exact price at which Berkshire sold its Apple stock, but based on Apple's current market value, the company likely received sale proceeds in the ballpark of $82 billion. We also don't know exactly why Buffett decided to hit the sell button. (A sale of this magnitude was almost certainly authorized by Buffett himself.)\nHowever, there are a few potential reasons, including but not limited to:\nTaking profits: Berkshire was sitting on a gain of more than 400% from Apple, and Buffett might have wanted to take some profits off the table.\nReducing concentration: Buffett isn't scared of having a concentrated portfolio, but at the end of 2023, Apple made up about half of Berkshire's stock portfolio.\nRaising cash:\u00a0After the Apple sale, Berkshire had $277 billion in cash and Treasuries. Buffett might see a recession in the near future and wants available capital to deploy.\nWhatever the reason, Berkshire now has a far-less-concentrated stock portfolio than it did and a massive war chest of cash to work with.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO), as well as two micro-cap stocks Star Group, L.P. (SGU) and Aware, Inc. (AWRE). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Apple shares have lagged the the Zacks Tech sector past year ( +28.8% vs. +38.6%), but performed roughly in-line with the broader market (+28.8% vs. +27.5% for the S&P 500 index). Weighing on the stock's muted momentum is the macro overhang from China whose economic outlook continues to remain uncertian. The company reported decline in iPhone sales in third-quarter fiscal 2024 partially offset by strong growth in Services revenues.\u00a0Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis.\u00a0Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+160.7% vs. +114.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\u00a0A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\u00a0Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Coca-Cola shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. +11.3%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evidenced by its strong track record of beating expectations. In second-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter, with both metrics showing year-over-year improvement.\u00a0Strong revenue growth across most operating segments, supported by improved price/mix and unit volume growth aided results. KO is well-poised to benefit from innovations and growing digital investments. It has provided an optimistic view for 2024.\u00a0However, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)Shares of Star have gained +6.6% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry\u2019s gain of +11.1%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $409.70 million witnessed strong revenue growth, driven by a 25.3% increase in heating oil and propane volumes, and improved margins despite warmer weather.\u00a0Strategic acquisitions are bolstering market position, adding significant volume and operational synergies. The company has enhanced profitability by reducing its adjusted EBITDA loss by $18.9 million and maintaining strong cost control, leading to improved margins. Star Group's leadership in home heating, diversification into related services and a robust balance sheet with solid cash flow management further strengthen its investment case.\u00a0However, challenges include declining heating oil volumes, weather sensitivity, customer attrition and rising operating expenses. Additionally, the company faces competitive pressures from alternative energy sources, which could impact market share and profitability.(You can read the full research report on Star here >>>)Aware\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry over the year-to-date period (+48.8% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $53.17 million witnessed 17% revenue growth in the first half of 2024, driven by new customer acquisitions and a 14% rise in recurring revenue, reflects a shift toward a subscription model and underscores its market expansion and improved financial predictability.\u00a0Strategic cost management reduced operating expenses by 7%, narrowing net losses and enhancing adjusted EBITDA. The shift to a recurring revenue model, with a 31% second-quarter 2024 revenue uptick, and securing large contracts, including a $1.2 million automated biometric identification system (ABIS) deal, highlight Aware's growing global footprint.\u00a0Yet, declining cash reserves, continued net losses, reliance on government contracts and limited market diversification pose significant risks.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Tech giant Apple on Monday named insider Kevan Parekh as its chief financial officer, replacing company veteran Luca Maestri who will transition from the role on Jan. 1, 2025.\nThe leadership change comes ahead of Apple's multiple product launch this fall season, which analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone.\nIt includes artificial intelligence features, which are crucial for Apple as it looks to reverse a slowdown in global sales, particularly in China, and better compete with rivals who have rolled out AI upgrades.\nParekh, who has been with Apple for more than a decade and will join the company's executive committee, most recently served as vice president of financial planning and analysis.\n\"It appears that the transition to the new CFO is planned and orderly, which is the most important question. Maestri staying on with Apple is also very important, as it removes the risk of financial questions,\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.\n\"(Parekh) will need to continue the prudent capital management, but may also be tasked with restarting Apple's exploration of complimentary acquisitions.\"\nBefore Apple, Parekh held senior leadership roles at Thomson Reuters and General Motors.\nApple said Maestri will continue to lead the corporate services teams, including information systems and technology, information security and real estate and development, reporting to CEO Tim Cook.\nDuring Maestri's tenure, Apple more than doubled its revenue, with services revenue growing more than five times.\n\"Apple filling the role with an internal candidate should make the transition a bit smoother... any change of this magnitude does create some level of uncertainty, especially given the consistency and the history of execution from Maestri,\" Piper Sandler analysts said in a note.\nEarlier this month, Apple said its third-quarter iPhone sales were better than expected and forecast more gains as it bets on artificial intelligence to attract buyers, even as its overall China business disappointed.\nIn recent years, iPhone sales have slowed due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices.\nAt its developers conference in June, Apple announced a slew of AI features under the umbrella \"Apple Intelligence\", including a revamped Siri and an integration with ChatGPT.\nThe iPhone maker's shares were last down nearly 1% in extended trading.\n(Reporting by Manya Saini and Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n"

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Just Cut Half of Berkshire Hathaway's Stake in Apple. Why?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett once referred in 2020 to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as Berkshire's third business, following its insurance arm and the BNSF railroad. However, that may not be the case for much longer.\nThe Buffett-led conglomerate unwound a large chunk of its stake in the iPhone maker in the second quarter, the company revealed in its recent earnings report. Berkshire cut its holdings in Apple from $135.4 billion at the end of the first quarter to $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.\nApple stock also soared by 23% during the second quarter. If you assume the sale came toward the end of the quarter, Berkshire dumped roughly half of its Apple shares. Berkshire had begun selling Apple in the first quarter, and the value of its stake in the tech giant is down 56% from the end of 2023, when it was worth $174.3 billion.\nWhy did Berkshire dump so much of its Apple stake after Buffett had trumpeted the company's praises so many times? There's no clear answer to that question, but I can make several educated guesses, based on Buffett's past behavior and Berkshire's historical patterns. Here's a closer look.\nAfter Berkshire's 13-F filing in May showed that the company had sold more than 116 million shares of Apple, cutting its stake by 13%, Buffett addressed the move at the annual shareholder meeting in May. He implied that the sale was to hedge any risk of capital gains tax rates going up, telling his audience: \"If I'm doing it [paying capital gains tax] at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact we sold a little Apple this year.\"\nBuffett was referring to talk in Washington about the capital gains tax rate going up, though there are no specific plans to raise it. However, it's possible that Berkshire continued to sell Apple in the second quarter for the same tax-motivated reason, though there's been no progress in raising the capital gains tax rate recently.\nBuffett hasn't made a specific comment on Apple's valuation, but has bemoaned pricey valuations in the stock market at times and seems to believe prices are stretched again.\nAnd Apple stock has gotten expensive. It finished the quarter with a price-to-earnings ratio above 32, reaching its highest level since the early days of the pandemic, when its growth soared, driven by remote work and school and the need for new devices.\nBy comparison, Apple's growth has slowed considerably since then, with revenue up 4% in its most recent quarter. Under those circumstances, Berkshire's trimming its ownership of Apple would make sense, though it's unclear if the sale was motivated by valuation.\nAnother plausible reason for Berkshire to sell Apple is to raise cash, perhaps to buy a different stock or make an outright acquisition. In Berkshire's May shareholder letter, Buffett did refer to the company's ability to capitalize on market sell-offs as \"our not-so-secret weapon.\" In order to do use that weapon, Berkshire needs cash on hand to be able to buy discounted stocks and businesses. In that regard, selling Apple, by far Berkshire's largest holding, makes sense.\nThe sale helped Berkshire beef up its cash hoard, as the company finished the second quarter with $272 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term Treasury bills. That's up substantially from $163 billion at the start of the year.\nIt's possible that Buffett and his Berkshire management team have been preparing for a market sell-off, and it seems like they've been rewarded with one. The S&P 500 gave up 6% over a three-day span ending on Monday.\nWhat's also notable is that Berkshire hasn't significantly reduced any of its other top-five holdings, though it has been selling some Bank of America stock recently. That indicates there may be more than raising cash behind the Apple stock sales.\nWe should learn a bit more when Berkshire files its 13-F update on its holdings next week, which will reveal a full list of buys and sells.\nApple still remains Berkshire's biggest holding after the second quarter and could certainly stay that way, so the sale may have been driven by rebalancing as well as other portfolio management guidelines. It's also possible that Apple's valuation or slowing growth contributed to the sale.\nWhile we'll probably never know for sure, Apple investors should take comfort in knowing that the stock remains Berkshire's largest holding and Buffett has lauded the company on several occasions.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It was the stock sale heard 'round the world.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Warren Buffett sold roughly $90 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares. This comes on the heels of Berkshire also selling blocks of its Apple stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\nWhat was Buffett thinking? And could selling so much Apple stock be the biggest investing mistake he's ever made?\nLet's first look at why Buffett might have sold 390 million shares of Apple in Q2. Some could think the legendary investor has soured on the company. However, I don't believe that's the case.\nSure, Buffett wrote in his 1988 letter to Berkshire shareholders, \"[W]hen we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\" The fact that he sold nearly half of Berkshire's stake in Apple in Q2 could seem to indicate that he no longer views the business or its management team as outstanding.\nBut Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May that American Express and Coca-Cola were \"wonderful business[es].\" He added, \"And we own Apple, which is an even better business.\" Buffett said this with Apple CEO Tim Cook sitting in the audience. The statement doesn't sound like the words of a man who doesn't like Apple's business or its management.\nPerhaps Buffett sold Apple because of valuation concerns. Maybe he wanted to increase Berkshire's cash stockpile (which now stands at nearly $277 billion) to buy a business that he thinks is an even better opportunity.\nOr possibly Buffett expects taxes to go up substantially in the future and selling now allows Berkshire to keep more profits. He hinted at this rationale at the Berkshire shareholder meeting.\nWhatever Buffett's reasons for selling Apple, could it be his biggest investing mistake ever? My answer to this question is: I don't know. I believe that's the best answer.\nDifferent investors can make different decisions about buying, holding, or selling any given stock. And their different decisions can be the right one for them.\nBefore Berkshire reported its Q2 results, Apple made up 43% of the conglomerate's total portfolio. As much as I like Apple (it's the biggest stock position in my portfolio), I wouldn't feel comfortable having it make up that high of a percentage of my holdings. However, Buffett didn't have a problem with having so much money invested in Apple for years.\nWe don't know what Buffett plans to do with the money raised from selling Berkshire's Apple stock. As I mentioned earlier, he could have what he thinks is a better investment opportunity in mind. It's never a mistake to sell a stock when you can put your money to better use.\nAlthough I've focused so far on whether or not selling $90 billion of Apple stock could be Buffett's biggest investing mistake, I think there's a better question to ask. That question is: Will Apple continue to be a good stock to own for investors?\nThis is an important question for many investors -- including Buffett. Apple remains by far Buffett's biggest holding.\nIn my view, the answer to this question is a resounding \"yes.\" My confidence stems largely from Apple's new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\nWedbush wrote to investors last week, \"Our view is betting against Cook and Cupertino into an AI-driven supercycle led by iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence is the wrong move for investors as the renaissance of growth returns to the Apple story.\" I agree with this take 100%.\nMaybe Buffett made a mistake by selling so much Apple stock; maybe he didn't. However, I think anyone who underestimates Apple right now is making a mistake that could cost them over the next several years.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett is considered one of the greatest investors in American history due to his track record with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B). Specifically, Berkshire stock has compounded at roughly 19.8% annually since Buffett took control of the company in 1965, nearly doubling the performance of the S&P 500.\nIn recent years, one of the most widely discussed aspects of his business has been its sizable stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Berkshire began buying shares in 2016. Whether the original purchase was made by Buffett or his understudies is unknown, but Buffett likely controlled the position as it grew in size over the years, and he is likely responsible for trimming the position in recent quarters.\nQ4 2023: Apple accounted for 49% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.\nQ1 2024: Apple accounted for 40% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.\nQ2 2024: Apple accounted for 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.\nIn May 2023, Buffett said, \"Apple is different than the other businesses we own. It just happens to be a better business.\" That statement is seemingly at odds with the recent selling spree. CNBC estimates that Berkshire's stake in Apple declined to 400 million shares in June 2024, a 55% reduction from 905 million shares in December 2023.\nHowever, Buffett's conviction in another megacap company has not wavered. He has repurchased shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock in each of the last three quarters, spending a collective $5 billion on buybacks. The message is clear: Buffett believes Berkshire is undervalued.\nApple has cultivated immense pricing power by pairing trendy hardware with proprietary software and services, creating a closed ecosystem that other manufacturers cannot replicate. Indeed, the average iPhone sells for three times more than the average Android smartphone. Apple has a strong presence in smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and smartwatches, and the company also operates the leading mobile app store and it has one of the fastest-growing advertising businesses in the U.S.\nApple reported lackluster financial results in the June quarter, despite beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 4.8% to $85.8 billion and GAAP net income rose 7.6% to $21.4 billion. There were a few highlights. The company continued to repurchase stock, so earnings per share increased 11%. Apple also reported 14% sales growth in services, which come with much higher margins than its hardware products.\nHowever, sales in China fell 6% and operating income slipped 10% during the quarter, as promotions failed to overcome waning demand for iPhones. Indeed, IDC estimates that quarterly iPhone shipments in China declined 3%, despite an acceleration in the broader market. As a result, Apple lost its spot among top five smartphone companies in the region, while local competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi gained share. That trend is problematic because China accounted for 19% of total revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended September 2023).\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 10% annually through fiscal 2025. That makes its current valuation of 33.5 times earnings look outrageously expensive. I say that because it gives Apple a PEG ratio of 3.4, well above the three-year average of 2.5. That may explain why Buffett has aggressively sold Apple in recent quarters, and it also leaves room for continued selling in future quarters.\nBerkshire Hathaway owns subsidiaries in a diverse range of industries, including insurance, railroads, energy, utilities, manufacturing, and retail. The core insurance business generates investable cash with which Warren Buffett has earned great returns. As evidence, Berkshire's book value per share \u2014 a good measure for changes in intrinsic value \u2014 compounded at 12% annually over the last five years, nearly keeping pace with the 13.1% gain in the S&P 500.\nBerkshire has another important quality in its resilience. Its subsidiaries have not only been hand selected by Buffett, a consummate investor with a knack for identifying competitively advantaged businesses, but also the diverse nature of those subsidiaries means Berkshire is not overly reliant on a single sector or industry. That has helped Berkshire outperform the S&P 500 during difficult market environments, as shown in the chart below.\nBear Market Start Date\nS&P 500 Maximum Decline\nBerkshire Hathaway Maximum Decline\nMarch 2000\n(49%)\n(24%)\nOctober 2007\n(57%)\n(54%)\nFebruary 2020\n(34%)\n(30%)\nJanuary 2022\n(25%)\n(27%)\nAverage\n(41%)\n(34%)\nData source: Yardeni Research, Ycharts.\nBerkshire reported reasonably good financial results in the June quarter. Revenue rose 1.2% to $93.7 billion and operating earnings increased 16% to $11.6 billion. The shining star was the insurance segment, where operating earnings from underwriting and fixed-income investments climbed 56%. Meanwhile, earnings generally declined across other segments.\nAs a caveat, GAAP net income dropped 16% to $30.3 billion during the quarter. However, Buffett has cautioned investors to ignore that figure because it includes gains and losses (both realized and unrealized) on stocks. In the June quarter, Berkshire recorded $28 billion in unrealized losses versus $24 billion in unrealized gains in the same quarter last year. That discrepancy explains the decline in GAAP earnings.\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Berkshire to grow operating earnings at 12% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 22 times operating earnings look a little expensive, though Buffett clearly believes the stock is undervalued. \"With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,\" Buffett wrote in his most recent shareholder letter.\nInvestors looking to strengthen their portfolio with a defensive stock should consider buying a small position in Berkshire Hathaway today.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Apple says Patreon must switch to its billing system or risk removal from App Store",
        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "Apple has threatened to remove creator platform Patreon from the App Store if creators use unsupported third-party billing options or disable transactions on iOS, instead of using Apple's own in-app purchasing system for Patreon's subscriptions. In a blog post and email to Patreon creators about upcoming changes to membership in the iOS app, the company says it's begun a 16-month-long migration process to move all creators to Apple's iOS in-app purchase system by November 2025.\nPatreon also informed creators it will switch them over to subscription billing as of November 2024, but they will be able to decide whether to price their memberships at a higher fee to cover Apple's commission or decide if they want to absorb the fee themselves. In addition, creators can opt to delay the migration in their Patreon settings to November 2025, the company said. However, if creators choose the latter option, they won't be able to offer memberships in the iOS app until they adopt Apple's iOS in-app purchase system, as Apple's rules will apply as of this November.\nThe announcement serves as another example of how Apple's App Store rules have been applied unevenly -- an accusation that Apple has faced in the past from critics, including Fortnite maker Epic Games, which sued the tech giant over antitrust issues. While Epic largely lost that lawsuit, as the court ruled Apple was not a monopolist, it did decide the iPhone maker would have to allow links to other payment options inside their apps. As a result, Apple now allows developers to promote their subscriptions via links to a website, but with a 27% commission instead of the standard 30%, or 12% instead of 15% for auto-renewing subscriptions in year two. (Apple's compliance with the court's injunction is still being fought in court.)\nDespite Apple's rules and policies, Patreon had existed in an odd sort of gray area, as some of its subscription-based offerings could be consumed in its app while others could not. Another possible reason for the Patreon exception was due to the fact that many users didn't come to Patreon itself to discover creators and content, Patreon CEO Jack Conte told tech news site The Verge in 2021. Instead, the discovery took place through other channels. Though the company admitted it didn't have any sort of special contract with Apple to avoid the App Store fees, the app had been able to skirt Apple's in-app billing requirements for some time.\nClearly, Patreon is not happy with the recent pressure from Apple to now comply with its policies, as it tells creators that neither of the options presented -- either raising their subscription prices or eating the cost themselves -- is \"ideal.\"\n\"Most creators on Patreon use subscription billing,\" Patreon's blog post points out. \"Over the past few years, we\u2019ve slowly rolled it out, tackling each hurdle that has come up to ensure that the migration is not disruptive for creators. That\u2019s the way we like to roll out products. Unfortunately, because of Apple\u2019s timelines and constraints, we can\u2019t continue to do it this way. Instead of helping creators move to subscription billing if and when they feel like it\u2019s right for them, we\u2019re now forced to migrate all creators on Apple\u2019s timeline.\"\nThe company reminded creators that Apple's fees only apply to the iOS app and that creators can continue to offer the same prices on the web and Android. It also advised creators to send their fans to a Help Center article that explains iOS fees so subscribers \"can better understand the implications of where they choose to make their purchases.\"\nPatreon and Apple were not immediately available for further comment.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/apple-says-patreon-must-switch-to-its-billing-system-or-risk-removal-from-app-store/\n"

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other beginner stocks.\nWhile investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.\nOver the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.\nNevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.\nAdditionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.\nOn August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.\nMinkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven\u2019t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.\nFor beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.\nHowever, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven\u2019t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.\nThe U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.\nIn the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\u201cAccording to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify large to mega-cap stocks with a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 5% over the last 10 years. The companies we chose are well-known, well-established, fundamentally strong, and some also pay regular dividends. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 8.03%\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a prominent American multinational technology company and is known for its groundbreaking consumer electronics, software, and services. The company first gained recognition with the launch of its Apple I personal computer.\nOver the years, the company has transformed into one of the world\u2019s most valuable brands, renowned for its flagship products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. In addition to its hardware, it offers a range of digital services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Apple Pay, and AppleCare. It is fourth on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy now.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has long been a significant player in the technology sector, and it is set to build on its position with an ambitious push into generative AI. While AI has been part of the company's ecosystem for years, through the Siri virtual assistant, it is ready to better its AI capabilities with the upcoming launch of Apple Intelligence.\nThe new suite of features, expected within the year, will introduce a refreshed Siri interface and offer functionalities such as email summarization, content rewriting in various tones, and phone call transcriptions. Future updates will include integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which further expands its AI capabilities.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been integrating AI accelerators into its M-series processors from the start, which positions the company uniquely in the tech landscape. By making Apple Intelligence compatible with all Apple Silicon Macs, iPads with M-series processors, Vision Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and future iPhones, the company will likely possess the largest base of AI-capable devices. Its devices, powered by the M-series and A17 Pro processors, will possibly be able to handle complex AI tasks directly on the device rather than relying on cloud computing.\nIn addition to these advancements, the company remains a high-margin leader in the tech industry. In the third quarter, it saw a 5% increase in net sales, reaching $85.8 billion. This growth was fueled by a 14% rise in services revenue and substantial iPhone sales, which totaled $39.3 billion.\nWith its continued innovation in AI and robust financial performance, the company is well-positioned for sustained growth and market leadership. The expansion of AI functionalities across its product lineup and impressive sales figures highlight the company's ongoing potential and strategic direction.\nIn the second quarter, 184 hedge funds had stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with total positions worth $124.175 billion. With 400 million shares worth $84.248 billion, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is the most prominent shareholder in the company, as of June 30.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  LaToya Scott ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett, arguably America\u2019s most successful investor, is at it again. His latest moves in the stock market have captured the attention of investors. Under his control since 1965, he has led Berkshire Hathaway (BRK. A, BRK. B) to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 with his calculated decisions.\nDon't Miss:\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nThis startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry \u2013 Here\u2019s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\nBuffett\u2019s large stake in Apple (AAPL) has been a source of intrigue for years. Berkshire Hathaway began buying AAPL shares in 2016, and the technology giant became one of its largest holdings. Buffett previously had nice things to say about the technology giant, referring to it as a \u201cbetter business\u201d than other companies in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio. Despite those positive comments, recent moves suggest Buffett is changing his strategy with Apple.\nSee Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nAccording to a report by CNBC, Berkshire Hathaway drastically reduced its stake from 905 million in Apple as of December 2023 to 400 million by June 2024, a 55% decline. Nobody might have expected this since Buffett has been a big admirer of the tech giant.\nPerhaps this carries the sell-off reasoning toward Apple\u2019s recent performance. The company still posted revenues of $85.8 billion in the June quarter \u2013 4.8% above the same period last year \u2013 but the future outlook was grim.\nSee Also: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nSales on the Chinese market, a key market for Apple, plummeted by 6%, and the company\u2019s operating income fared even worse with a 10% decrease. It lost its previous position in the top five smartphone companies within China, while competitive brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi fared very well. These problems and a valuation that some analysts believe appears stretched may have prompted Buffett to reassess his stance.\nDespite trimming Berkshire's stake in Apple, Buffett remains bullish on another investment: Berkshire Hathaway. He has repurchased $5 billion of Berkshire shares in the last three quarters, indicating a bright outlook. \u201cWith our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation,\u201d he wrote in a recent shareholder letter.\nTrending: Don\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s financial results have been outstanding despite its ups and downs. In June, the company reported a 1.2% revenue gain to $93.7 billion and a 16% rise in operating earnings to $11.6 billion.\nThe insurance group did particularly well, with earnings from underwriting and fixed-income investment up 56%. However, Berkshire\u2019s GAAP net income dropped by 16%, to $30.3 billion, a number Buffett has called one that investors should pay very little attention to because of the volatility of unrealized gains and losses on stock investments.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nAnalysts have long forecast Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings to increase 10% in 2024 and then reduce by 3% growth in 2025. With Buffett\u2019s ongoing buyback program, this would have given the appearance that he is getting extreme value for Berkshire Hathaway, even as he reduces his exposure to other assets, such as Apple.\nBerkshire Hathaway could very well be a godsend for investors seeking a safe and stable long-term investment. If Warren Buffett continues to express so much faith in his own company, this might well be a green light for others to do the same.\nRead Next:\nWhen today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out.\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Warren Buffett Declares Shift: Selling Apple Stock To Invest In This 'Magnificent' Megacap \u2013 Here's Why originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - Warren Buffett appears to have soured on stocks, letting cash at Berkshire Hathaway soar to nearly $277 billion and selling about half its stake in Apple, even as the conglomerate posted a record quarterly operating profit.\nBerkshire's results released on Saturday suggest the 93-year-old Buffett, one of the world's most revered investors, is growing wary about the broader U.S. economy, or stock market valuations that have gotten too high.\nThe results followed a stock market selloff that pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory, and a weak jobs report that sparked worries about U.S. economic activity and whether the Federal Reserve waited too long to cut interest rates.\n\"If you look at the entire Berkshire picture and the macroeconomic data, a safe conclusion is that Berkshire is getting defensive,\" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire a \"buy.\"\nBerkshire's cash stake grew to $276.9 billion as of June 30 from a then-record $189 billion three months earlier, largely because Berkshire sold a net $75.5 billion of stocks.\nIt sold about 390 million Apple shares in the second quarter, on top of 115 million sold from January to March, as the iPhone maker's stock price rose 23%. Berkshire still owned about 400 million shares worth $84.2 billion as of June 30.\nThe second quarter was the seventh straight quarter that Berkshire sold more stocks than it bought.\nBerkshire also repurchased just $345 million of its own stock, down from $2.57 billion in the first quarter, and none in the first three weeks of July.\n\"Buffett doesn't seem to think there are attractive opportunities in publicly traded stocks, including his own,\" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst with a \"hold\" rating on Berkshire. \"It makes me worry what he thinks about markets and the economy.\"\nGEICO BOOSTS RESULTS\nSecond-quarter profit from Berkshire's dozens of businesses rose 15% to $11.6 billion, or about $8,073 per Class A share, from $10.04 billion a year earlier.\nNearly half of that profit came from Berkshire's insurance businesses including Geico car insurance, where underwriting profit more than tripled as premiums rose and claims fell.\nBut revenue rose just 1% to $93.65 billion, with little change in major businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and a 12% drop at the Pilot truck stop chain.\nConsumers also showed signs of cutting back, causing revenue to decline at Berkshire's more than 80 auto dealerships because they spent less per vehicle on new cars, trucks and SUVs.\nBerkshire's returns from short-term Treasuries should decline once rate cuts begin.\nShanahan said that and revenue headwinds \"may make it tough for Berkshire to deliver earnings growth in 2025.\"\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns many industrial and manufacturing companies, a big real estate brokerage, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom.\nQuarterly net income fell 15% to $30.34 billion from $35.91 billion a year earlier, as rising stock prices in both periods boosted the value of Berkshire's stock investments.\nBuffett has long urged shareholders to ignore Berkshire's quarterly investment gains and losses, which often lead to outsized net profits or net losses.\nBUFFETT WANTS TO SPEND, BUT DOESN'T\nBerkshire pledges to keep a minimum $30 billion of cash, but often lets it build up when it can't find whole businesses or individual stocks to buy at fair prices.\nSince mid-July, Berkshire has also sold more than $3.8 billion of shares in Bank of America, its second-largest stock holding.\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said at Berkshire's May 4 annual meeting, referring to Berkshire's cash.\nBuffett said he expected Apple to remain Berkshire's largest stock investment, but selling made sense because the 21% federal tax rate on the gains would likely grow.\nThe sales came only two years after Buffett labeled Apple one of Berkshire's \"four giants,\" along with its insurance businesses, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\nBerkshire and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.\nProfit at BNSF fell 3% as the railroad set aside more money for lawsuits, offsetting lower operating costs and greater shipping of consumer and agricultural products.\nLawsuits against the PacifiCorp utility unit also weighed on Berkshire Hathaway Energy, where profit fell 17%.\nMany homeowners and businesses blame PacifiCorp for causing Oregon wildfires in 2020. The utility set aside $2.7 billion for wildfire losses as of June 30, up from $2.4 billion three months earlier, and said losses could grow significantly.\nBerkshire's Class A shares closed Friday at $641,435. They are up 18% this year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 is up 12%.\nBuffett has led Berkshire since 1965. Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 62, is expected to succeed him as chief executive.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Currently, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is atop the throne as the largest company in the world. It leads second-place Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by $280 billion, but I don't think it will maintain its leadership position.\nIn the next five years, I think multiple companies will overtake Apple, but two picks are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). These two have a strong case for becoming larger than Apple, but it won't happen overnight.\nFirst off, let's talk about Apple. In my opinion, Apple is trading so high due to its past performance. If you look at the performance without the name attached, Apple isn't currently that great of an investment. If I approached you with a stock that posted shrinking revenue for five of the last seven quarters, and in the two quarters it delivered growth, the best growth rate was 5%, you'd probably pass. Throw in the fact that this company is trading at 34 times forward earnings, and you'd run for the hills.\nBut, because Apple is Apple, investors give it a pass. This won't go on forever, and eventually, something will give. This opens up a lane for Alphabet and Amazon to surpass it, as they still have multiple growth catalysts ahead of them.\nWhile many think of Amazon as just an e-commerce channel, it's much more than that. Commerce businesses have notoriously low margins, so Amazon has multiple other divisions that help boost its profits. One of the fastest growing is its advertising services, which has been on fire over the past few years.\nAnother strong segment is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing offering. AWS is the largest cloud computing business by market share but has recently delivered slightly less growth than its competition. However, AWS' growth has reaccelerated, which is a huge selling point for the stock.\nAlthough AWS makes up 18% of Amazon's revenue, it accounted for 64% of its operating profit in the second quarter. Though Amazon's business is much broader than cloud computing, its cloud services are a massive part of the Amazon investment thesis. With the cloud computing market expected to expand from $680 billion in 2024 to $1.44 trillion in 2029, it has a huge demand wave pushing it.\nAn investment in Alphabet is also an investment in its advertising business. With ad revenue making up around three-fourths of total revenue, it's a huge part of its business. Many are worried its search engine dominance may come to an end with competitors like OpenAI entering the arena. However, I think these concerns are overblown, as it would require billions of people to change their habits very quickly.\nI don't see that happening anytime soon, so I'm not concerned about some of the increased competition.\nAnother bonus for Alphabet is its cloud computing wing, Google Cloud. While Google Cloud isn't as big as AWS, it's still a big part of the growth story, as cloud computing is in huge demand thanks to the AI arms race.\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet have their primary businesses, but their cloud computing wings are huge reasons to consider buying the stocks. Apple doesn't have the same kind of growth catalysts pushing it, so don't be surprised if either of these two passes up Apple within the next five years.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "India watchdog orders rare recall of Apple antitrust reports",
        "Author": "  Aditya Kalra ",
        "Text": "By Aditya Kalra\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's antitrust body has taken the unusual step of recalling two reports that detailed alleged breaches of competition law by Apple, which complained that the regulator had disclosed commercial secrets to competitors including Tinder-owner Match.\nThe move will prolong an already delayed investigation, which began in 2021, centering on Apple's alleged abuse of its dominant position in the apps market to force developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system, at a fee of up to 30%.\nApple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as lawsuits from corporate rivals. It has denied all wrongdoing.\nReuters reported last month that two reports prepared by India's antitrust investigations unit in 2022 and 2024 and circulated to concerned parties in July found Apple had exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system, to the detriment of app developers, users and other payment processors.\nHowever, in an Aug. 7 confidential order that Reuters is the first to report on, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) asked all Apple's opponents in the case for the return of the reports.\n\"It is imperative that such information be maintained confidential, ensuring that no unauthorised disclosure occurs,\" the CCI said in a four-page order signed by its top four officials.\nThe order follows Apple's private complaint to the CCI that versions of reports shared with parties disclosed \"Apple's confidential commercial sensitive information\" adding that the watchdog must \"recall and withdraw\" them, the order showed.\nThe order did not say what information Apple was concerned about. A source with direct knowledge of the matter pointed to disclosures related to revenue generated by Apple's India app store and figures on market share.\nApple says it is a small player in India, where phones using Google's Android system are dominant.\nAmong those now being asked for the return of the reports are Match and Indian startup group ADIF, which represents financial giant Paytm and other companies.\nApple and Match declined to comment. The CCI did not respond to requests for comment.\nPrateek Jain, an associate director of ADIF, said the recall highlighted the importance of protecting commercial secrets while ensuring investigations are thorough and impartial.\n\"Indian startups deserve a fair playing field, free from the constraints imposed by dominant global players,\" he added,\nSuch a recall of reports is rare and will require them to be revised by the redaction of information deemed confidential, said three Indian lawyers familiar with the CCI process and a government source with direct knowledge.\n\"We are looking at two to three months of delay, easily,\" said one of the lawyers who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nFollowing responses to the reports by the concerned parties, the CCI typically would have ruled on fines or any required change in Apple's business practices.\nApple's iOS powered about 3.5% of India's 690 million smartphones by mid-2024, with the rest using Android, says Counterpoint Research, which adds however that Apple's domestic smartphone base has become five times larger in as many years.\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Kirsten Donovan)\n"

        "Title": "Warren Buffett may have heeded this \u2018sell\u2019 signal on Apple stock: While market cap quadrupled, profits only doubled",
        "Author": "  Shawn Tully ",
        "Text": "Remember 2016? Barack Obama was in the White House, Zika virus was the looming threat, \"The Sound of Silence\" by Disturbed raged on the rock charts, and Apple\u2014yes that Apple\u2014was a value stock.\nIndeed, none other than value-stock-loving Warren Buffett went on a buying spree starting in Q1 of 2016. By all the metrics that govern future returns, Apple (AAPL) ranked as an ideal investment during the entire period of Berkshire's major purchases, which lasted to Q1 of 2018. Take the mid-point of that span, June of 2017. At the time, Apple, based on fundamentals, little resembled the current version sporting a super-premium price and attracting such fabulous forecasts on Wall Street. Instead, it had all the qualities of a great value stock. Its market cap stood at $750 billion, and it was en route to posting $47 billion in GAAP net earnings for FY 2017 (ended September 30).\nThat put its PE at a lowly, unloved 16. As it does today, Apple was returning virtually all of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Stock returns have three components: Earnings growth, the total \"yield\" provided by dividends plus buybacks, and changes in the PE multiple. Because Apple's price was so low relative to its earnings, it boasted a yield of 1.7%, and the repurchases provided an additional boost of 4.4% by giving the remaining shares a bigger portion of the earnings. So investors were getting 6.1% from those two sources combined, plus future growth in profits, just if the multiple stayed well below the market average.\nThose numbers set an extremely low bar for achieving big returns. To reach 10%, Apple only had to grow net profits by 3.9%, since the dividend plus buyback combo were already contributing 6% plus, sans any increase in profits. Hitting that just under 4% bogey meant growing annual earnings by around $2 billion a year. Clinching that target looked like a light lift. Plus, any rise in that beaten-down PE would supply extra fuel.\nFor a few years, though, Apple's profits remained stuck in the $50 billion range. Then, in the stay at home pandemic economy, sales of its laptops and other staple gear for remote work exploded. Starting in FY 2022, Apple was booking nearly $100 billion in annual profits, twice the number three years earlier.\nThe rub: Apple's market cap ramped far faster than even the gigantic swing in earnings. By mid-June of this year, its valuation had swelled to $3.2 trillion, over four times the figure in mid-2017. Put simply, Apple's profits doubled and its market cap quadrupled, taking its PE from a modest 16 to towering 32. The former deep value play had morphed into the model of a super-high priced tech racer.\nThe surge in Apple's price immensely reduced the power of its dividends and buybacks. Its yield has dropped from 1.7% in mid-2017 to a current, piddling 0.48%. Buybacks are now contributing an additional 3.1%, way down from the 4.4% when Buffett was loading up. Hence, the two combined provide a foundation of just 3.6%, less than two-thirds the old 6.1%. So just to provide 10% returns going forward, Apple must grow earnings by the difference of 6.4% (the 10% goal minus 3.6% from dividends plus buybacks). Of course, that formula assumes its PE stays at the current multiple exceeding 30.\nHow many billions does it take to raise profits 6.4% a year? The answer: $6.4 billion on top of today's base of $100 billion. That's over three times the bogey of $2 billion required in mid-2017. Here, Apple runs afoul of the law of large numbers. At current margins, it would need to raise sales by around $25 billion a year just to achieve that 10% return. What it would need to add annually equals 12% of Microsoft's average total revenues over the past three years. From the close of from FY 2021 to FY 2023, Apple's top line has grown by only $2.3 billion.\nPut simply, Apple will face a tough climb to keep compounding profits at 6% a year on a Brobdingnagian starting base of $100 billion. But it faces a second problem: The likelihood that its PE won't remain anywhere near the current level of 32.3. That's number for turbo-charged grower, not a mature player like Apple.\n9So let's posit that Apple indeed expands earnings at our 6% requirement that, combined with dividends and buybacks, would deliver a 10% return, assuming no change in valuation. In that case, it would be generating $120.5 billion in net GAAP profits by FY 2027.\nBut say its PE falls to 20, which is still above the long-term average for the S&P 500. Buybacks would help by raising earnings-per-share around 10%. But that's not enough. Even with the jump in profits and the repurchases, its shares would be selling at around $175, 17% below where they stand today.\nHence, Apple faces a pair of daunting challenges for rewarding investors. First, that it will be hard pressed growing profits fast enough from the $100 billion level, a number that's doubled post-pandemic, to compensate for the now-low contribution from buybacks and dividends. The second, related issue: Only companies promising big profits growth sustain huge multiples, and at its current size, Apple looks more like a plodder than a sprinter.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): This AI Stock Is Trending Right Now",
        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Even though AI power on mobile devices is often a hot subject around Wall Street, the increased capabilities of personal computers and laptops running AI is often under-discussed. Recent analysis by global tech analytics firm Canalys reveals that the PC industry is on pace to ship 44 million AI-capable PCs in 2024. This would more than double to 103 million units in 2025. Apple is leading the market in this regard. The number of AI-powered PCs shipped during the second quarter of 2024 has hit close to 9 million. The AI PCs of Apple, named Mac, account for 60% of shipments, showcasing supremacy over rival Microsoft which shipped 39% of AI-capable PCs during the time.\nThe bullish sentiment around the tech giant is shared by experts on Wall Street. In a recent investor note, research analyst Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America maintained a Buy rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a price target of $256. The analyst even sought to allay fears regarding new EU rules, stressing that the firm appeared able to comply with the latest App Store link-out restrictions in the European Union as the Core Technology Fee would offset the lower App Store take rates required by the Digital Markets Act.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd\u00a0on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Warren Buffett has reduced his stake in Apple AAPL by almost 50%, per the latest filings by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B). The legendary investor\u2019s company now holds 400 million AAPL shares worth $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024.Apart from Apple, BRK.B also reduced its stake at Bank of America BAC to $41.1 billion. Roughly 72% of Berkshire\u2019s holdings are concentrated in only five stocks: Apple, American Express, Bank of America, Coca Cola KO and Chevron.The sharp sell-off is unlikely of Buffett who is known to hold onto stocks for a very long time. The reduction in stake led to an increase in Berkshire\u2019s cash balance to roughly $277 billion, a move partially to lower capital gain tax as mentioned by Buffett in May.\u00a0However, Buffett's followers know that he loves cash in hand as substantial cash allows the company to do whatever it wants. Hence, the question is, should an investor follow Buffett\u2019s move to sell off Apple shares or should pile up more at current prices?\nThe Value Style Score of D suggests that AAPL is overvalued at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 28.37X compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 24.49X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn terms of performance, Apple shares have gained 9.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 10.3%.Moreover, Apple shares are trading below the 50-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn the past month, Apple shares have declined 7.6%, outperforming the sector\u2019s drop of 14.1%. We believe the dip presents a significant opportunity for investors to pile up on AAPL shares, given the iPhone maker\u2019s growing focus on leveraging AI in its devices.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple has been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.Leveraging the power of Generative AI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context.\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc.

He famously sold his 10% stake in the company for just $800 \u2013 a decision that, in hindsight, seems almost unimaginable. Today, thanks to Apple's current market value of approximately $3.45 trillion, Wayne\u2019s stake would be worth around $345 billion.\nTrending: Here\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nRonald Wayne, born in 1934, was already an experienced engineer and entrepreneur when he joined forces with the much younger Jobs and Wozniak in 1976. At 41, Wayne brought maturity and stability to the team, otherwise brimming with youthful energy and ambition. His job was to provide \"adult supervision\" to the startup, manage the mechanical engineering, and handle the necessary paperwork. Wayne was instrumental in drafting the original partnership agreement and even designed Apple's first logo. Despite his significant contributions, Wayne's time with Apple was incredibly short \u2013 just 12 days.\nSo, why did he walk away? Wayne was concerned about the financial risks involved. Jobs had taken out a $15,000 loan to fill an order for The Byte Shop, a retailer with a shaky reputation. As the only one with substantial personal assets (including a house), Wayne feared that the debt would fall on him if the business failed. Jobs and Wozniak, having no real assets then, had little to lose, but Wayne wasn't in the same position. The fear of financial ruin led him to sell his shares to Jobs and Wozniak for that fateful $800.\nTrending: Groundbreaking trading app with a \u2018Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market \u2013 here\u2019s how to get equity in it with just $100\nLooking back, it's easy to see Wayne's decision as a monumental mistake, especially given Apple's incredible success.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).\nWhat Happened: Berkshire said the fair value of its Apple holding at the end of the second quarter was $84.2 billion, down about 38% from $135.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. Looking at the reduction from the perspective of number of shares, the math works as follows:\nBerkshire had 789.37 million shares of Apple at the end of the March quarter (according to 13F filing)\nApple\u2019s average stock price for the June quarter was $186.14 and the stock ended the quarter at $210.62.\nThe $84.2 billion worth of stake Berkshire disclosed in the 10-Q for the second quarter suggests Berkshire may have been left with 399.77 million shares (taking the closing price for the quarter).\nSee Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nThe math suggests a 49.36% reduction in Apple stake by Berkshire in terms of the number of shares.\nApple, which reported quarterly results Thursday, said its board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share, payable on Aug. 15 to shareholders of record as of Aug. 12. The 390-million shares Berkshire is estimated to have sold would have fetched the Buffett-led firm a dividend income of $97.5 million.\nIf Berkshire held onto the 789.37 million shares it owned at the end of the March quarter, it could have reaped a dividend windfall of a little over $197 million.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nCramer Explores Motive: Commenting on Berkshire\u2019s action, CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer said Buffett\u2019s decision may have been prompted by Apple\u2019s China weakness. \u201cWarren crushed Apple and the story is being viewed as \u2018China risk,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\u201cCramer apparently doesn\u2019t subscribe to the idea. \u201cDid anyone bother to read or see how well Apple did in China this q?

        "Title": "Apple Just Sent a Major Warning to Nvidia Investors",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Practically everyone building an artificial intelligence (AI) large language model relies on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) for its high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Big tech companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and others have been committing billions of dollars to Nvidia just to get their hands on the next batch of chips.\nBut Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), true to its roots, thinks differently.\nThe company revealed its long-awaited AI features in early June. It's calling the system Apple Intelligence, which consists of multiple generative AI models fine-tuned for various tasks, such as writing, summarizing, image generation, and interacting with iPhone and Mac apps. But those models weren't trained using Nvidia GPUs. They weren't trained using GPUs at all.\nApple used Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train its Apple Foundation Models, which power Apple Intelligence. A TPU is a special type of computer chip called an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC. Unlike a GPU, an ASIC chip is relatively limited in what kind of processes it can run. But it runs those processes extremely efficiently.\nApple used the fourth and fifth generations of Google's TPUs to train its foundation models. Google says the TPU v5p, released late last year, is 2.8 times faster than the fourth-generation design. And Google's TPU v4 was between 1.2 times and 1.7 times faster than the Nvidia A100. Some back-of-the-envelope math then puts the v5p chips on par with Nvidia's latest H100 chips. In May, Google introduced its sixth-generation TPU, which produces even more speed improvements.\nIn other words, when it comes to training a foundation model for generative AI, Google's own designs appear to be just as good as Nvidia's latest hardware. More importantly, they're more energy- and cost-efficient than using a GPU. As a result, Apple can end up with a foundation model for Apple Intelligence at a fraction of the price it would've cost to use Nvidia's chips.\nApple certainly isn't the only company using Google TPUs for training its AI, but the fact that one of the wealthiest companies in the world decided to go with TPUs over Nvidia should send a major warning to Nvidia investors.\nNvidia relies on a small group of tech giants for a large part of its business. Google is one of its biggest customers despite the fact that it's spent a decade designing its own AI chips. Likewise, Nvidia's other biggest customers -- Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta -- are all designing their own custom silicon for training and running AI models.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai may have summarized the biggest reason these companies continue to purchase every chip they can from Nvidia on his company's second-quarter earnings call. \"When we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us.\" In other words, the potential loss from not spending heavily on AI chips and data centers is far greater than the cost of spending.\nBut ultimately, Google TPUs and other custom silicon may prove a more cost-effective way to continue scaling the AI businesses of these tech giants. And Apple's decision to use TPUs is a major testament to that.\nCustomer concentration is a major risk for Nvidia. During Q1, two customers accounted for 24% of its total revenue. As these customers work to reduce their dependence on Nvidia, the chip designer could see its revenue growth slow significantly over the next few years.\nConsidering the expectations for Nvidia are high, that makes the potential for more AI developers to use cost-effective ASICs\u00a0instead of Nvidia GPUs a serious threat to the stock price. One bad quarter could send shares considerably lower.\nEven after the pullback in price, Nvidia shares trade for over 42 times forward earnings and an enterprise value-to-revenue multiple of around 34. Both are extremely high for a company of its size, and while it's managed to beat expectations amid the ongoing AI boom, the potential for a slowdown in sales and profits keeps getting stronger. Nvidia's AI dominance won't last forever, but investors are acting like it will, based on its current share price.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

This scenario could, indeed, be a possible resolution to the antitrust law violations declared earlier this week.\nIf the agreement between Google and Apple was terminated, Apple customers would have more autonomy when choosing and changing their search engine.\nIn its current form the agreement runs until at least September 2026 with Apple having the right to extend the contract for a further two years, according to documents filed by the Department of Justice in the antitrust case.\nAnalysts agree that the ruling will speed up Apple's move towards AI-powered search services as the tech giant recently announced plans to deploy OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot on its devices.\nIn a bid to avoid monopoly deals that could bring Apple under scrutiny of their own, the company has said it is also in talks with Google to implement Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot as well as other AI products.\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google has seen little affect to the share price in the aftermath of the court ruling with Apple\u2019s shares currently trading flat.\n\"Apple could lose $20bn in Google search antitrust ruling\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of 1.32%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $85.78 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.59%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $81.8 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nApple shares have added about 15.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 15.8%.\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.55 on $93.04 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.61 on $388.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the top 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nDell Technologies (DELL), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 29.\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27%.

Such a change would enable the US firm to begin taking a cut of in-game transactions.\nApple has begun ramping up pressure on Tencent and ByteDance Ltd. to make fundamental changes to China\u2019s most popular apps, Bloomberg News has reported. The iPhone maker in recent months demanded the two companies close loopholes that their in-app creators employ to funnel users to external payment systems, circumventing Apple\u2019s typical 30% commission, according to people familiar with the matter.\nOn Wednesday, Mitchell said Tencent does not monetize mini games via in-app purchases on iOS presently and discussions are underway to potentially enable the function, which would benefit developers, users, Apple and Tencent.\n\u201cWe want to make it available on terms that we think are economically sustainable, that are also fair.

        "Author": "  Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you've owned Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock over the last five years, chances are your position has grown to become a large percentage of your portfolio. Shares are up an incredible 330% over this period, obliterating the S&P 500's 94% gain over the same period. This may put some investors in an uncomfortable position, prompting them to consider trimming the position to reduce the risk of being too overweight in a single security.\nSo, for those investors with an \"overweight\" position in the stock, is now a good time to sell some shares?\nSure, tenaciously holding onto Apple shares over the long haul may be the reason some shareholders have done so well in recent years. But the past is not always indicative of the future. For instance, one major difference in Apple stock today compared to five years ago is its valuation. Five years ago, the stock only earned a price-to-earnings ratio of 18. Today, the stock commands a price-to-earnings ratio of about 34.\nAnother way the company's situation differed substantially in 2019 from today was its net cash position as a percentage of the company's market capitalization. Apple's net cash of $102 billion at the end of its third quarter of fiscal 2019 amounted to nearly 11% of its market capitalization at the time. This significant position gave Apple excess cash beyond its regular cash flows to help repurchase huge sums of shares relative to its share count. Net cash today is $52 billion, or less than 2% of Apple's multitrillion-dollar market cap.\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Apple stock today is the huge discrepancy between the company's growth profile and the stock's valuation. A price-to-earnings multiple in the thirties suggests investors expect strong growth from Apple's underlying business for years to come. Yet Apple's fiscal third quarter revenue only increased 5%. Sure, the market consensus seems to be that the company's integration of artificial intelligence into its products will reaccelerate sales, but there's no guarantee this will play out. And even if it does, it's arguably already priced into the stock.\nThough it may not be wise for Apple shareholders to sell all of their shares, it likely makes sense to sell some -- perhaps enough to make the position equal weight to some more conservatively valued stocks in an investor's portfolio. With Apple's price-to-earnings ratio currently more than 40% higher than the S&P 500 market index's P/E of 24, the risk/reward profile for the stock simply isn't as compelling as it was in years past.\nInvestors, of course, should carefully consider their own financial situation before making a decision about what to do with their Apple stock, but it may be worthwhile for investors overweight in the stock to consider taking some profits off of the table and redeploy that cash into better opportunities.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Apple's High Valuation: A Bull Trap in the Making?",
        "Author": "  Sheraden Frances ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) recently cut its stake in tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by nearly 50%, reducing its holdings from 790 million shares to 400 million shares according to the company's second-quarter earnings report. This move is quite unusual for Buffett, who is known for holding stocks for the long term, signaling that he may perceive a disconnect between Apple's valuation and its future growth potential.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with CRM.\nList of 52-Week Lows\nList of 3-Year Lows\nList of 5-Year Lows\nIn my view, while Apple remains a high-quality company, it currently faces several challenges. The lack of meaningful innovation, coupled with inconsistent profitability and cash flow growth, raises concerns about its future prospects. Although the tech company's recent artificial intelligence announcements were well-received by Wall Street, driving the stock price higher as if a \"supercycle\" had already begun, I believe the financial impact of these new offerings will be limited.\nAdditionally, despite the Buffett-induced selloff, Apple's stock has managed to recover, outperforming the S&P 500 with an approximately 17% gain year to date compared to the S&P 500's 12.70% increase. However, owning an overpriced, slow-growth blue-chip stock like Apple, especially with interest rates hovering between 4% and 5%, arguably makes little financial sense, even when considering the strength of the brand.\nLet's delve a bit deeper to further explore my perspective on the stock.\nAt the recent Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced its ambitious plans to integrate AI technology across its platforms, including iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and MacOS Sequoia, through a partnership with OpenAI's ChatGPT. This initiative, dubbed Apple Intelligence, aims to enhance Siri by using personalized data to generate tailored responses, potentially positioning the virtual assistant as an alternative search engine.\nWhile this represents a significant milestone for the company, there are notable execution risks. For instance, the success of Apple Intelligence may depend heavily on an upgrade cycle, which could be hindered by the current bleak economic environment and looming recession risks. Additionally, with smartphone demand projected to grow modestly at just 4% in 2024, the feasibility of a massive AI-driven upgrade cycle in the near term seems questionable. Further complicating matters, regulatory challenges, particularly the European Union's Digital Markets Act, could limit access to Apple Intelligence features, raising concerns about user privacy and data security.\nChina, a key market for Apple, accounting for approximately 19% of total sales, has been a point of concern due to continuous revenue declines. Revenue for the region fell to $14.70 billion (down 7% year over year) in the third quarter, following an 8% year-over-year decline in the second quarter. This downturn underscores Apple's dependence on iPhone sales and its vulnerability to market fluctuations in China.\nThe disruption in Apple's manufacturing operations in late 2022 due to protests and Zero-Covid restrictions slowed iPhone production, compounding the challenges posed by increased competition from Huawei and Samsung (XKRX:005930). As a result, the company lost its position as the world's largest smartphone provider in the first quarter of 2024, with Chinese manufacturers also making significant strides in technology, enabling them to compete effectively on a global scale. Further, Apple's AI tools face significant regulatory and market obstacles, particularly in China, where ChatGPT is not operational, and there are increasing calls to limit the use of American-made AI models - which could impede its efforts to revive growth in one of the largest consumer markets.\nWhile I acknowledge the introduction of Apple Intelligence could potentially strengthen the company's ecosystem, there are legitimate concerns about whether the upside from generative AI tools will be sufficient to justify the company's current valuation and offset the other risks that have been impacting the business. This situation raises the possibility that Apple's shares might be in bubble territory, especially given the numerous challenges it faces and the uncertain impact of its AI initiatives. This concern could have also been another contributing factor to Buffett's recent exit.\nAs Apple remains a key gatekeeper in the digital world, investors appear eager to reward it for its foray into generative AI. However, the critical question is whether the recent breakout in the stock is actually supported by fundamentals, or if we are witnessing a bull trap. Additionally, Apple has shown revenue declines in several key segments, with the Vision Pro being the most recent example of overhyped expectations failing to translate into meaningful near-term revenue. My prediction that Apple would suspend research and development on the Vision Pro 2 due to poor sales has already come to pass. The central issue now is whether the long-term growth potential from AI will be enough to offset these underlying fundamental challenges.\nOn Aug. 1, Apple released its third-quarter results, marking a return to sales growth after a period of declines. The company reported $85.80 billion in sales, representing a 4.90% year-over-year increase that aligned with market expectations. This return to growth is notable as it had not reported growth approaching 5% since the fourth quarter of 2022. However, while it is encouraging to see the company return to this growth benchmark; the low single-digit increase highlights just how optimized and mature its existing business has become.\nThe company's peak market share is evident in its iPhone segment, which saw a 1% year-over-year decline in revenue during the third quarter, continuing a trend of stagnation outside the Covid-19-induced surge in 2021. Although Apple sold 45.60 million smartphones (up 6% year over year) in the third quarter, the total smartphone market expanded by 12% to 288.90 million units. Consequently, Apple's share of the smartphone market shrank to 16%, down 1 percentage point from the previous year. The pressures in China, where sales have been declining, are a significant factor behind this as Apple faces intensifying competition from local manufacturers like Huawei and Oppo.\nDespite the challenges in its hardware categories, Apple continues to find growth in its Services segment. In the third quarter, Services reached an all-time revenue high of $24.20 billion, representing a 14% year-over-year growth rate. This segment includes offerings like AppleCare, AppleOne, Apple TV+, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay and other non-hardware-related revenue streams. The increasing adoption of these services is a bright spot for Apple, now accounting for 28% of total revenue, up from 26% a year earlier. However, it is important to note the company's hardware sales are a key driver for its Services revenue. As hardware revenue continues to decline, I believe we will inevitably see a slowdown in services revenue growth. Therefore, I don't think the Services segment can sustainably offset the declines in product revenue in the long run.\nI remain bullish on Apple's margins, particularly due to the strong performance of its Services segment. Last quarter, the unit accounted for over 45% of the company's total gross profits, and with gross margins in this segment reaching an impressive 74%, the overall margin mix is significantly boosted. As Apple continues to generate revenue from its services, I expect margins to remain at these levels, barring any significant deterioration. However, there are potential risks to margins (albeit relatively small), especially with the hype surrounding new product launches that fail to meet expectations. For instance, the Vision Pro has not lived up to its initial sales forecasts. The high investment required to make this segment profitable is reminiscent of Meta's (NASDAQ:META) Reality Labs, which posted a quarterly loss of $3.90 billion. Apple could face similar expenses as it builds out the Vision Pro ecosystem, potentially impacting overall profitability.\nApple's free cash flow yield is another area of concern and could be one reason behind Buffett's decision to reduce his stake. Currently, the company's FCF yield stands at around 3%, which, in my view, is unimpressive compared to risk-free cash yields currently at 5% This is a stark contrast to when Buffett began building his Apple position in 2016, a time when its free cash flow yields exceeded 11% and risk-free cash yields were below 2% (based on one-year Treasury rates). The current setup is the exact opposite, making Apple a far less attractive investment from a cash flow perspective. Moreover, when Berkshire Hathaway acquired Apple shares, the annual cash dividend yield was 2.20%, roughly equivalent to the S&P 500 index average and significantly better than one-year Treasury rates in 2016. Today, however, the dividend yield is just 0.44%, compared to cash investments offering closer to 5% returns. In my view, buying into Apple at these levels, given the equity price risk and minimal dividend yield, is not a sound investment strategy.\nApple is undoubtedly a high-quality company, but even for top-tier players, it is crucial to carefully assess the stock's valuation.\nOver the last 15 years, Apple's valuation has rarely been as high as it is today, with the exception of a brief period during the pandemic when tech stocks surged due to exceptionally low interest rates. Now, with interest rates at multiyear highs, Apple's forward price-earnings ratio of around 30 is striking, nearly double its pre-pandemic average. This elevated valuation is particularly surprising given the company's ongoing challenges with weak revenue growth and the recent reduction in Buffett's stake.\nIf Apple's AI innovations fall short of the high expectations set by the market, the stock could face a significant correction from its current multiple. Should Apple revert to its pre-pandemic average price-earnings ratio of approximately 17.50, the share price would drop to around $132about 42% lower than its current level. With the iPhone segment, its key revenue driver, encountering significant headwinds, any negative reception of the next iteration could catalyze a substantial correction. Much of Apple's gains over the last decade have been driven by multiple expansions, and it's uncertain whether this elevated valuation is sustainable in the long term, especially considering its declining smartphone market share.\nFrom a discounted cash flow valuation perspective, minimal earnings growth is anticipated for 2024, with an expected acceleration in 2025 and beyond, driven by the release of new iPhones and the anticipated positive impact of AI offerings.\nSource: valueinvesting.io\nEbitda is projected to gradually increase in the forecasted period, with margins slowly improving as Apple expands into the generative AI field. The DCF model uses a weighted average cost of capital of 9%, which is close to the market's average cost of capital, and a terminal growth rate of 4%. Even under such a bullish scenario, the model yields a fair value of only $170 per share, which represents a downside of approximately 25% from current levels. This suggests that despite the growth opportunities associated with Apple Intelligence, the company's shares could be in bubble territory following their recent rapid appreciation.\nWhile Apple remains a high-quality company, its current valuation, coupled with declining sales in critical segments and competitive pressures, suggests caution. The integration of AI technologies, though promising, may not sufficiently offset these fundamental challenges.\nWith Apple trading at an elevated valuation and its buyback program becoming less efficient as a result, it might be wise to lock in gains and await a more favorable entry point in the future. Given its unimpressive growth numbers, I believe we will have an opportunity to buy Apple at or below its fair value within the next 12 to 24 months. The downside risks for Apple stock are significant, so I believe investors should exit with Buffett at the current price. However, I do not recommend shorting.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- To some, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s gutting of its Apple Inc. stake could be interpreted as a lack of conviction in the iPhone maker\u2019s growth story. But many on Wall Street are urging investors to look past the news and stay calm.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\nNew York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\nNew York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants\nThe 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk\nNYC Subway Riders See \u2018Exceptionally High\u2019 Air Pollution\nThe Warren Buffett-led conglomerate revealed Saturday that it sold almost half of its position in the tech giant during the second quarter. Its stake now stands at roughly $84 billion, down from about $140 billion at the end of March. The selling took place during a torrid run in the stock market that sent Apple shares 23% higher and pushed the S&P 500 from one record to the next.\nSince 2016, when Warren Buffett first disclosed its stake in Apple, its shares have soared almost 900% as the company cemented its grip on the industry, delivering Berkshire billions of dollars worth of unrealized profits along the way.\n\u201cBuffett\u2019s reduction of his Apple stake is merely about risk management,\u201d said Joe Gilbert, senior portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. \u201cIf there were any concerns about the longer-term viability of Apple, Buffett would have exited the entire position. Similar to Berkshire\u2019s other stock position reductions, Buffett has meaningful unrealized gains.\u201d\nBerkshire\u2019s portfolio reveal comes just days after Apple released its own quarterly results, which showed a return to revenue growth and signaled that new AI features will boost iPhone sales in the coming quarters. Apple shares were steady after the earnings report and ultimately ended the week higher despite the broader selloff.\nWhile the investment strategy of Buffett \u2014 long known as the Oracle of Omaha \u2014 is hard to ignore, Berkshire\u2019s stake in Apple had gotten so large in recent years that some investors had begun to wonder whether the firm would have to trim its position to balance out its holdings. Even after the unwind, Apple remains Berkshire\u2019s largest single position.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got this outsized position you take some profits and you reduce some of your concentration risk,\u201d said Cathy Seifert, a research analyst at CFRA. \u201cThey still have a fairly concentrated portfolio,\u201d she added.\nRead: Berkshire Cuts Apple Stake by Almost Half in Selling Spree (2)\nIt\u2019s also not the first time Berkshire has cut its stake in Apple. At its annual meeting in May, the firm revealed that it had reduced its position during the first quarter of the year. At the time, Buffett hinted to investors that tax implications may have played a role in the sale.\nRepresentatives for Apple and Berkshire Hathaway didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment outside of regular business hours on Sunday.\nThe latest announcement comes amid broader concern about the potential of an economic downturn ahead. Worse-than-expected jobs data on Friday stoked fears the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to start reducing interest rates, sending the Nasdaq 100 Index into a technical correction and the Cboe Volatility Index toward 25.\nMegacap peers including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have all tumbled from record highs reached in early July. In total, Nasdaq 100 members have shed more than $3 trillion in value over that stretch with both Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. each seeing declines of more than 20%. Apple, meanwhile, is down about 6% from its all-time high.\nIt\u2019s possible that Berkshire, like an increasing number of investors, wants to see more proof that Apple\u2019s AI investments will pay off with revenue growth and isn\u2019t convinced that\u2019s happening fast enough, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\nApple\u2019s valuation multiple \u2014 at 33 times future profits as of mid-July \u2014 was 11 points higher than that of the broader S&P 500, a gap that was last seen in the aftermath of the pandemic and the financial crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. But despite the valuation premium, Mulberry thinks it still makes sense for investors to own Apple shares. \u201cThey\u2019re still in a healthy balance sheet position and they\u2019re still going to grow earnings faster than the broader market,\u201d he said.\nOthers, including Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, point to Apple\u2019s brand loyalty and future growth - it\u2019s on the cusp of what he thinks is a major upgrade cycle that will drive revenue growth in 2025 and 2026.\n\u201cWhile some could read this as confidence worry, Apple just delivered a robust quarter with a massive AI driven super cycle ahead and we do not view this as the time to hit the exit button,\u201d Ives said.\nOf course, Apple isn\u2019t the only stake that Berkshire has trimmed lately \u2014 it\u2019s been unloading shares of Bank of America Corp., cutting its position by 8.8% since mid-July. Some see that as a sign that Buffett doesn\u2019t see any individual problems with either company, but is instead betting that the US consumer and broader economy are set to weaken.\n\u201cBuffett may feel we\u2019re about to go into a recession, so by raising cash now he will be able to buy companies cheap later on,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. . \u201cHe may smell an opportunity coming.\u201d\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica, Subrat Patnaik and Natalia Kniazhevich.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown\nFive Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent\nWhy Leaders Have a Hard Time Knowing When to Leave\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Wall Street futures are drifting lower Thursday ahead of the release of the weekly jobless claims data. Apple is in the spotlight over claims it could charge for its AI product, while the impact of the global carry trade remains in focus.\nU.S. stock futures edged lower Thursday, stabilizing to a degree following several dramatic swings in recent days.\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 100 points, or 0.3%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 15 points, or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 32 points, or 0.2%.\nThe Wall Street indices closed lower Wednesday, unable to hold an early rally, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing over 200 points, or 0.6%, lower, while both the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1%.\nThere are more earnings to digest Thursday, including from drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and fashion retailer Under Armour (NYSE:UA).\nAdditionally, Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) stock slumped 30% premarket after the online dating agency cut its annual revenue growth forecast, sparking worries about its growth plans.\nWarner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) stock fell almost 10% premarket after the entertainment giant reported a quarterly net loss of $10 billion, announcing it has written down the value of its traditional television networks by $9.1bn, a dramatic recognition of how fast streaming is eroding the cable business model.\nWorries about a U.S. hard landing, after Friday\u2019s weak nonfarm payrolls release, sparked the sharp selloff on Wall Street.\nWith this in mind, the macro spotlight is squarely on the weekly jobless claims figures out of the U.S. later in the day, with economists expecting initial jobless claims to total 241,000 last week, a small reduction from the prior week\u2019s 249,000.\nThat release showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week, adding to fears that the labor market was cooling quickly.\nThe report from the Labor Department on Thursday also showed the number of people on jobless rolls swelling in mid-July to the highest level since late 2021.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that while he viewed the changes in the labor market as \"broadly consistent with a normalization process,\" policymakers were \"closely monitoring to see whether it starts to show signs that it's more than that.\"\nOne of the main contributors to the market turmoil of the last few days has been the unwinding of the global carry trade - which involves investors borrowing money in a place where interest rates are low and using it to invest elsewhere in assets that generate a higher return.\nFor years this has widely involved the Japanese yen, as the Bank of Japan has held interest rates near zero in an attempt to stimulate a stagnant economy.\nHowever, the BOJ raised interest rates last week, while rates are already falling in a number of other regions while the Federal Reserve has signaled that it may join this club next month.\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said in a note that the risk-reward for global carry is low due to U.S. elections and potential repricing of funders on lower U.S. rates and rates momentum is expected to turn more significantly against G10 carry which favors the rotation to value.\nIt added carry baskets have already suffered a significant drawdown following the tech sell-off, and the spot component of the global carry basket suggests that 75% of carry trades have been removed.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) expressed optimism over its iPhone sales going forward at its latest quarterly release, as it expects additional features based on artificial intelligence to attract buyers.\nThe tech giant is expected to launch this fall what analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone, including artificial intelligence features - known as Apple Intelligence.\nApple could charge its users up to $20 for its advanced artificial intelligence features, analysts told CNBC, as the company looks to boost the growth of its lucrative services business.\nApple\u2019s services division brought in $24.2 billion in the June quarter, making it unique as many other hardware firms have not managed to monetize software.\nIt is not unusual for technology firms to charge for their AI offerings. OpenAI, for example, has a subscription fee for more advanced ChatGPT features and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) charges for its AI Copilot tool.\nCrude prices retreated Thursday, on course to end a two-day winning streak, as dismal economic data from top oil importer China reignited concerns surrounding global demand.\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.1% to $75.19 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $78.21 a barrel.\nData released earlier Thursday showed China imported around 10 million barrels of oil in July, down 12% from June and 3% lower than the same period last year.\nConcerns over Chinese growth, coupled with fears of a U.S. recession, have weighed heavily on oil prices in recent sessions.\nBoth benchmarks had gained around 3% over the last two sessions, bouncing off near-2024 lows, helped by the simmering tensions in the Middle East.\nAdditionally, crude inventories in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, fell 3.7 million barrels, data showed, marking a sixth straight weekly decline to six-month lows.\nRelated Articles\nUS futures, jobless claims, Apple - what's moving markets\nAnalysis-BOJ's communication about-face may haunt future rate moves\nMusk stirs UK divisions, sparks calls for faster rollout of online safety laws\n"

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities\u2019 PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 184\nGS' Number Of Funds: 43\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest and most valuable consumer technology company in the world. Roughly 52% of its nine month revenue ending June, or $155 billion out of $296 billion came from the sales of its iPhone smartphone lineup. This means that the phone is key to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis and is baked into the share price. This is based on investor belief that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s design strengths and robust ecosystem allow the firm to rely on its user base of roughly 1.5 billion users as of 2023 regularly upgrading its smartphones. This ensures that the iPhone continues to bring in billions of dollars in revenue annually. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) benefits from its world class design and engineering facilities which have also allowed it to reduce dependence on third party suppliers for key components such as smartphones and notebook processors. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s $61.5 billion in cash and equivalents also means that it can splurge on developing new products to maintain its competitive edge.\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\"\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. For example, the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price is up a whopping 338% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. On top of that, the share price is up 20% in about a quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n See our latest analysis for Apple \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nOver half a decade, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 352% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\nWe're pleased to report that Apple shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 21% over one year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 35% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Apple  that you should be aware of.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other technology stocks.\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI.\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an \u201cAI bubble\u201d. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index\u2019s steepest three-week slide in two years.\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here\u2019s a glimpse of the article:\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.\u201d\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn\u2019t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a \u201cPsychological Rotation\u201d. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184 \nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) the maker of the famous iPhone is one the best technology stocks to buy for the long term. It was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion.\nIt is one of the largest companies by market capitalization, which is more than $3.41 trillion as of August 23, 2024. The company has been growing its revenue by 8% and its net income by 10% during the past 10 years. The Q3 2024 of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was also a success story, its revenue grew 5% year-over-year to reach $85.8 billion, whereas, its earnings per share grew 11% during the same time.\nThe company also achieved record revenues from its Canada, Mexico, France, the UK, Germany, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand markets. Moreover, its service revenue also improved 14% year-over-year to reach an all-time high of $24.2 billion.\nAnalysts are expecting its earnings to grow by 17% during the year to reach $7, while the broader market average sits at 4%. 47 analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock, with their median price target of $250 presenting an upside of 11% from current levels.\nAnalysts are expecting that investments made in AAPL will pay off big time because of artificial intelligence. Yes, the company has been using AI for a long time as we have seen Siri as its virtual assistant, however, the company is about to scale up its AI game.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has announced plans to launch its Apple intelligence in the upcoming months. Its initial features include a new interface for Siri, the ability to rewrite content in different tones, summarize emails, and other AI accessibility features. Later, the company plans to integrate ChatGPT to further enhance its Apple intelligence for iPhone users.\nHere\u2019s the catch: The launch of Apple intelligence will only work on iPhone 15 Pro and the upcoming models thereby leading to an iPhone upgrade supercycle for the company. For context, during the most recent quarter, iPhone sales accounted for around 46% of the net sales. Thus, as expected the upgrade supercycle has the potential to substantially increase the revenue of the company and subsequently boost returns for its investors.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as Jensen Huang\u2019s AI giant is about to release earnings. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it\u2019s going to be a \u201cdifficult week\u201d for major tech companies.\nHowever, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term.\n\u201cI still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,\u201d Munster said.\nThe analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential.\n\u201cThere is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it\u2019s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.\u201d\nIn this article, we compiled the most important latest AI news and analyst ratings around major AI tech stocks.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a new bull: billionaire Dan Loeb. The founder of the New York-based hedge fund Third Point said in a latest letter to investors that Apple has a significant upside potential due to AI.\n\u201cWe believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced \u2018Apple Intelligence\u2019 suite of AI-enabled smartphone features \u2013 the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant \u2013 will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple\u2019s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First,\u00a0 iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple\u2019s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer focused AI apps such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT (with which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple\u2019s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage.\u201d\nLoeb reiterated the bull case that many other Wall Street analysts have made. This case assumes that millions of people will upgrade their iPhones because they\u2019d want to use AI-powered new models of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship device.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Amid rising inflation and increasing competition in the smartphone market, Apple might not be able to come up to the high expectations of strong iPhone upgrade numbers.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other American stocks.\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of those tech companies that needs no introduction, given its immense fame and contributions in the tech space. It is considered to be one of the best American investments because of its leading role in tech and its vast growth across the globe.\nInvestors are interested in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) not only because of its tech products but also because it has diversified its offerings to include attached services, such as the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay. Through these services, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ensured that it has a recurring revenue stream providing a higher margin. Over 1 billion subscribers pay for Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) attached services in 2024, which is almost double the amount of subscribers in 2020.\nConsidering the fact that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a distinct and market-leading brand and device ecosystem, investors believe that the company is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI. Another catalyst influencing this opinion and Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth is Apple Intelligence, a newly unveiled offering announced at the company's Worldwide Developer Conference. This product is built to enhance user experience for Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) customers by integrating AI into Apple devices. Many investors now consider Apple Intelligence to be the next big growth driver for both revenue and product demand.\nApple Inc.

        "Title": "Prediction: After Offloading Apple, This Will Be the Next Move Warren Buffett Makes With Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One the biggest storylines in the capital markets right now revolves around Apple. More specifically, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold off a significant portion of its stake in the iPhone maker according to recent filings.\nWhile this has raised many eyebrows in the investment community, I personally wasn't surprised. Moreover, I think Buffett is far from finished.\nLet's dig into Buffett's recent portfolio management and explore what the Oracle of Omaha might just do next.\nPer Berkshire's most recent quarterly report, the company's stake in Apple was worth $84.2 billion as of the end of the second quarter. By comparison, Buffett's Apple stake was worth about $135 billion at the end of the first quarter.\nWhile Apple remains a prominent pillar of Berkshire's portfolio, it's interesting to see Buffett reduce his stake by such a significant amount. With that said, there were some indications that this was coming.\nEarlier this year Berkshire trimmed its Apple position by about 13%. Buffett explained his rationale for that move during Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting -- citing that he believed changes to the tax code were on the horizon. Essentially, Buffett was looking to lock in some gains and avoid a higher tax liability should his prediction come to fruition.\nWhile it's impossible to predict the perfect moment to sell a stock, Buffett's logic makes total sense. Now that it's been revealed that he's reduced his Apple stake even further, I think there's a good possibility the famed investor will make another move that will also revolve around savvy tax planning.\nBuffett's portfolio is filled with blue chip, steady growth businesses such as Coca-Cola and American Express. Berkshire rarely invests in high-growth opportunities outside of its core industry positions.\nHowever, a few years ago Berkshire made one of its most intriguing moves in recent history.\nIn 2020, Berkshire invested approximately $730 million in the Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) initial public offering (IPO). Snowflake is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business specializing in big data analytics. Not only does Snowflake operate in the tech sector, which Buffett generally ignores, but at the time of the IPO the company was still burning cash. One of Buffett's core investment philosophies is to invest in companies that generate steady and growing cash flow.\nAccording to filings, Berkshire owns about 6.1 million shares of Snowflake.

        "Text": "One the biggest storylines in the capital markets right now revolves around Apple. More specifically, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold off a significant portion of its stake in the iPhone maker according to recent filings.\nWhile this has raised many eyebrows in the investment community, I personally wasn't surprised. Moreover, I think Buffett is far from finished.\nLet's dig into Buffett's recent portfolio management and explore what the Oracle of Omaha might just do next.\nPer Berkshire's most recent quarterly report, the company's stake in Apple was worth $84.2 billion as of the end of the second quarter. By comparison, Buffett's Apple stake was worth about $135 billion at the end of the first quarter.\nWhile Apple remains a prominent pillar of Berkshire's portfolio, it's interesting to see Buffett reduce his stake by such a significant amount. With that said, there were some indications that this was coming.\nEarlier this year Berkshire trimmed its Apple position by about 13%. Buffett explained his rationale for that move during Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting -- citing that he believed changes to the tax code were on the horizon. Essentially, Buffett was looking to lock in some gains and avoid a higher tax liability should his prediction come to fruition.\nWhile it's impossible to predict the perfect moment to sell a stock, Buffett's logic makes total sense. Now that it's been revealed that he's reduced his Apple stake even further, I think there's a good possibility the famed investor will make another move that will also revolve around savvy tax planning.\nBuffett's portfolio is filled with blue chip, steady growth businesses such as Coca-Cola and American Express. Berkshire rarely invests in high-growth opportunities outside of its core industry positions.\nHowever, a few years ago Berkshire made one of its most intriguing moves in recent history.\nIn 2020, Berkshire invested approximately $730 million in the Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) initial public offering (IPO). Snowflake is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business specializing in big data analytics. Not only does Snowflake operate in the tech sector, which Buffett generally ignores, but at the time of the IPO the company was still burning cash. One of Buffett's core investment philosophies is to invest in companies that generate steady and growing cash flow.\nAccording to filings, Berkshire owns about 6.1 million shares of Snowflake. Given its total investment of $730 million, investors can assume that Berkshire's cost basis in Snowflake stock is around $120.\nPer the chart above, it's clear that Buffett missed out on some significant gains in Snowflake stock a couple of years ago. Moreover, with the stock trading around $116 per share today, Berkshire is now sitting on a loss in its position.\nIf the chart above is any indication, Snowflake's price action is pretty volatile. Although there's a chance the stock could rebound significantly, the trends above indicate that investors have been engaging in some heavy selling of Snowflake stock for a while now -- particularly throughout 2024.\nWhile Buffett's loss in his Snowflake position isn't that big in the grand scheme of things, I still think there is a good chance he will exit the position.\nI can't say for certain why Buffett sold more Apple stock. My suspicion is that he is looking to stockpile more cash due to a variety of factors, including uncertainty in the market as it pertains to the upcoming presidential election, further hedging as it relates to potential changes to the tax code, and reducing his exposure to an ever-changing artificial intelligence (AI) narrative.\nAll of these concerns could very well impact stocks like Snowflake, too.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry has been experiencing explosive growth, making it a highly attractive sector for potential investors. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the global generative AI market was valued at approximately $40 billion in 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT, and is now expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 40% to reach over $1.3 trillion in size within the next decade. This growth is fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, where AI is being leveraged to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. For instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine are revolutionizing patient care, leading to more accurate and timely treatments. The finance sector is also reaping the benefits of AI through advanced algorithms for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking services.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe AI market is not just expanding in terms of applications but also geographically. North America has been a dominant force in AI development, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge. However, Asia-Pacific, particularly China, is rapidly catching up, driven by significant investments and a robust government push toward AI adoption. The Chinese government has an ambitious AI plan aimed to make the country a global leader in AI by 2030, with projections that the AI industry of China could reach $150 billion in size by then. This geographical diversification is crucial for investors looking to tap into different markets and reduce their risk exposure.\nInvestors should also consider the substantial investments being made in AI startups, which are critical drivers of innovation. According to CB Insights, AI startups raised over $66 billion in funding in 2022, marking a record year despite broader economic uncertainties. This trend is expected to continue as more venture capital firms and corporate investors recognize the potential of AI to disrupt traditional industries. Furthermore, the integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and quantum computing, is likely to create new opportunities and markets, further driving growth.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\u00a0\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The buzz surrounding Apple on Wall Street these days is not related to artificial intelligence, but rather the sale of Apple stock by Wall Street legend Warren Buffett. Even as the firm prepares to debut new M4 processors and Apple Intelligence, hardware and software specifically designed for AI tasks, the Buffett sale has overshadowed the upcoming annual Apple event. Buffett reduced his stake in the firm by half during the second quarter of 2024, latest 13F filings reveal. The timing of this move seems questionable, since Apple continues to show strong iPhone shipments and has the most AI-enabled PC portfolio in the global market.\nWhen it comes to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even Wall Street analysts seem to be at odds with Buffett. Investment advisory Loop Capital has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $300, implying upside potential of a handsome 32%. In a recent investor note, data cited by Loop Capital supply chain analyst John Donovan suggested that iPhone shipments for the September quarter were above market expectations.\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Kris Cooper ",
        "Text": "US video game and software developer Epic Games has today (16 August) launched a new mobile app store that will rival Apple\u2019s hegemonic App Store.\nThe Epic Games Store is available for download on iPhone in the EU and on Android devices worldwide. Its launch follows a lengthy legal spat between Epic and Apple that ultimately saw the latter forced to allow the use of app stores other than its own on its devices.\nEpic will initially distribute its own games via its store but says it is \u201cworking to enable all developers to launch their games and apps through the Epic Games Store in the future.\u201d\nThe launch also means that iOS users can now access the hugely popular video game Fortnite for the first time in four years.\nApple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 following a dispute with Epic, which objected to having to pay such a large cut of its revenues raised through the store to Apple and had tried to circumvent App Store rules by offering paid-for in-game content outside of Apple's ecosystem.\nThe developer had a similar grievance with Google in relation to its Play Store, and it went on to sue both, ultimately forcing the decision for Apple to have to allow the use of other app stores.\nAmong the other games to be initially offered on the Epic Games Store will be Fall Guys and Rocket League Sideswipe.\nEpic has been able to begin to challenge Apple\u2019s market dominance due to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, meaning that, for the first time, EU users will have an alternative to Apple\u2019s App Store.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the European Commission for making it possible to launch the Epic Games Store and offer our games to iOS users in the European Union,\u201d said Tim Sweeney CEO and founder of Epic.\nGlobalData principal analyst Laura Petrone commented to Verdict: \u201cIt seems that the tide is turning against Apple and Google's monopoly in app stores in Europe and the US.\u201d\n\u201cNot only is Epic Games returning to iOS in Europe and Android worldwide, but it is also available on alternative app stores due to enforcement of the Digital Markets Act.\u201d\nZeroing in on the regulatory landscape, Petrone added: \u201cEpic Games also managed to convince judges in the US that Google engaged in anticompetitive practices. Google's defeat in last year\u2019s lawsuit against Epic Games dealt a serious blow to Google and its business model in apps. Apple has been charged for the same practices by the European Commission under the Digital Markets Act and is in negotiation with Brussels to correct these practices.\u201d\nWhile there is progress within the EU, the regulatory landscape in the rest of the world still allows Apple to block iOS users from accessing Fortnite and Epic Games Store.\nDespite that, Petrone asserted that: \u201cThe legitimacy of app store rules on Android and iOS has been significantly weakened.\u201d\n\"Epic Games launches app store, challenging Apple\u2019s supremacy\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $84.45B.\nRevenue rose 5% as services revenue helped offset a slight decline in iPhone revenue.\nSales of its flagship iPhone handset device, which still makes up nearly half of total revenue, fell to $39.30B from $39.67B a year earlier, but beat estimates of $38.81B.\n\"Expectations for Apple's Q3 were fairly tepid, given that multiple new products, most notably the iPhone 16, are expected later this quarter,\" analysts at Third Bridge commented.\n\"It's worth noting that Apple is often considered a company that provides conservative guidance and focuses on execution.\"\nThe highlight of the report was the Services segment, which saw its revenue surge 14% to a record high of $24.21B, beating Wall Street estimates of $24.01B.\nMeanwhile, sales in China fell 6.5% to $14.72B as the iPhone has been facing rising competition in the region from local smartphone makers including Huawei.\nThe earnings call will dominate investor attention, with investors keen for details on guidance and Apple Intelligence.\n\"Overall numbers are ahead of expectations focus will be on GUIDE and Apple Intelligence commentary on the call but better China and stronger GMs are both better vs. buyside expectations,\" Evercore ISI said in a note following the results.\nLooking ahead, Apple said that revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter is expected to grow at a rate comparable to the 4.9% increase recorded in the April-June period, also above analysts' expectations.\n\"This was an upbeat conference call in our view as stronger September guidance is just the opening act for the main event which is an AI-driven super cycle starting with iPhone 16 launching in mid-September,\" said Wedbush analysts, raising their price target on Apple stock from $275 to $285.\nYasin Ebrahim contributed to this report.\nRelated Articles\nApple Q3 results beats estimates as services growth offsets softer iPhone sales\nProbability of 50 bps rate cut more than doubled after payroll data\nAmazon says consumers cautious, forecasts revenue below Wall Street targets\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recommends These 10 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent episode of Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed how global markets have become more interconnected than ever. He compared this to 1987, when Japan's influence on U.S. stocks was clear, with Japanese investors driving up prices in sectors like waste management and railroads. This connection between markets was strong then, and it's even stronger now.\n\"Obviously, we went down on Japan, and we went up on Japan. This is somewhat reminiscent of 1987, when, if Japan was up, they\u2019d come over and flood our markets. Sometimes they didn\u2019t care; they\u2019d just start buying stocks, often starting with waste management and Browning-Ferris. \"\nCramer explained that the weakening dollar further enhances this global link, benefiting companies that sell internationally, such as Coca-Cola. He also observed a significant shift in investor behavior\u2014where people once looked for reasons to stay out of the market, they now seem more inclined to stay in, finding optimism even in bad news. This change in attitude mirrors today's market environment, where good news lifts stocks, and even bad news is met with hope for a recovery.\n\"Back in the day, you\u2019d wonder why Browning-Ferris was up, and the answer would be, 'Large buyer, large buyer, large buyer.' Eventually, you\u2019d go out for a beer, and it turns out it\u2019s Tokyo. They loved the rails. There was such craziness back then, but now, we\u2019re even more linked. And with the dollar continuing to weaken, it\u2019s good that we\u2019re linked for companies like that.\"\nJim Cramer noted the irony of discussing September as a traditionally bad month for the market. He pointed out that when people focus too much on a specific month being negative, it often doesn\u2019t turn out that way. Cramer also mentioned that despite this expectation, the market had been up significantly, making last week\u2019s market behavior seem unusual.\n\"Well, it\u2019s funny. You talked about September being a bad month last week, so maybe we get there in a roundabout way. I know that when you single out a month, that\u2019s often when it doesn\u2019t happen. But I also know that we\u2019re up big, and last week seemed odd.\"\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Squawk on the Street and his post on the key things to watch in the stock market for Monday. We selected ten stocks that he mentioned and included information on hedge fund sentiment for each. The stocks are ranked by the number of hedge funds that own them, from lowest to highest.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) with a hold-equivalent rating and a price target of $211 per share. Cramer believes that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s AI initiatives will lead to a significant iPhone upgrade cycle. In his view, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has always been a stock to own for the long term rather than trade frequently.\n\"MoffettNathanson started coverage of Apple with a hold-equivalent rating and price target of $211 a share. Analysts deep-dived the iPhone maker\u2019s AI strategy and said they are largely positive on it, but believe the stock\u2019s current valuation is factoring that in already. I\u2019m a believer that Apple\u2019s AI initiatives will spark a significant iPhone upgrade cycle. Apple has long been an \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock in my eyes.\"\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on track for ongoing growth due to its globally recognized brand and valuable ecosystem, which includes iOS, macOS, watchOS, and a range of services. This ecosystem creates a smooth user experience that strengthens customer loyalty. The services segment, featuring the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, has become a major revenue driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads in product innovation with updates to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and wearables. Its strong global presence and ability to adapt to different markets ensure continued growth, with expanding opportunities in regions like China and India adding to its positive outlook. Additionally, the wearables segment, particularly the Apple Watch, has seen significant growth thanks to its popularity in health and fitness, boosting sales and revenue.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "While Apple Remains Berkshire\u2018s Top Holding, Buffett Cuts Stake in Half",
        "Author": "  Carolane De Palmas ",
        "Text": "While Warren Buffett\u2018s conglomerate only initiated its Apple investment in 2016, the company has been the cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway\u2018s investment since then, accounting for a staggering 50% of its holdings in 2023.\nHowever, a shift has occurred over the past year in Berkshire Hathaway\u2018s strategy, as it slashed its Apple stake by nearly half during the second quarter of 2024, following a 13% reduction in the first quarter. While Buffett maintains optimism and a bullish view about Apple, this significant divestment suggests a strategic pivot that he expressed being towards building Berkshire\u2018s cash reserves.\nApple\u2018s stock price, after soaring nearly 50% in 2023, tumbled over 8% in the first quarter of 2024, according to ActivTrades data. Investor concerns about declining Chinese sales and overall slowing growth likely contributed to this downturn. This contrasted sharply with the S&P 500\u2018s 10% gain and the Nasdaq\u2018s 8% rise during the same period.\nApple\u2018s dominance in China\u2018s smartphone market is facing unprecedented challenges. iPhone sales plummeted by 19.1% in the first quarter of 2023, according to a Counterpoint Research\u2018s report published last April.\nThis sharp decline coincides with Huawei\u2018s resurgence,as the domestic giant saw a staggering 69.7% sales surge. Huawei\u2018s strengthened position, particularly in the premium segment, has significantly eroded Apple\u2018s market share.\nGreater China, comprised of mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, once Apple\u2018s most lucrative market, witnessed a 6% sales decline last quarter, despite accounting for nearly half of the company\u2018s total revenue. While currency fluctuations impacted sales, the underlying weakness in the mainland market is undeniable.\nTo counter these challenges, Apple is betting on its upcoming iPhone and the integration of advanced AI capabilities.\nBy introducing AI-powered features like enhanced Siri, advanced photo editing, and intelligent text interaction, Apple aims to differentiate its products and regain lost ground. However, navigating China\u2018s complex regulatory landscape while successfully implementing AI technology will be crucial for the company\u2018s success.\nThere is still a lack of consensus among analysts on the possible influence that Apple Intelligence, its push into artificial intelligence, might have on iPhone sales. While there are many who believe that the software will usher in a new age of iPhone sales, there are others who take a more cautious approach.\nApple\u2018s stock experienced a meteoric rise of over 35% between April\u2018s low and its mid-July peak of $237 per share. This surge was primarily driven by investor excitement following the company\u2018s ambitious AI announcements at the June Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\nKey AI initiatives unveiled at the conference included deeper integration with OpenAI\u2018s ChatGPT to enhance Siri\u2018s capabilities, the introduction of customizable Genmoji emojis powered by Apple\u2018s AI, and the expansion of Apple\u2018s Writing Tools to seamlessly work within third-party applications.\nApple\u2018s potential new iPhones, which would be driven by artificial intelligence, are expected to revolutionise the smartphone industry, which is fuelling long-term optimism over Apple\u2018s stock. Recent price drops, on the other hand, indicate that investors are pondering the real impact of AI on Apple\u2018s future results.\nDavid Vogt, an analyst at UBS, is among those who are sceptical. Despite the fact that Apple\u2018s revenue for last quarter exceeded projections, mostly due to the performance of the iPad, other areas did not meet expectations, such as Mac and Wearables, Home, and Accessories. In addition, the company\u2018s forecast for the current quarter shows that the firm would continue to see only modest growth.\nWhile Vogt continues to retain a \u201cHold\u201d recommendation on Apple, with a price target of $190, this indicates that he has a cautious stance on the company\u2018s potential for growth in the foreseeable future.\nApple shares experienced a significant downturn yesterday, plunging by 4.96% after opening with a nearly 10% gap down.This sharp decline pushed the stock price into the green Ichimoku cloud, often interpreted as a zone of equilibrium or consolidation.\nTechnically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rapidly approached oversold territory following the sharp price drop.Prior to this, the RSI had been gradually declining and hovering near the neutral level of 50, indicating a loss of upward momentum.\nThe bearish gap and subsequent price action suggest a potential shift in market sentiment towards Apple. While the Ichimoku cloud provides initial support, traders should closely monitor price action and RSI developments for indications of a potential trend reversal or continued downside pressure.\nDisclaimer\nCFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage.

        "Title": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): \u2018Too Good To Let Go\u2019",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Bullish Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's other bullish stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for the current market, highlighting a significant historical perspective. He reminded viewers that 20 years ago, Google went public at $85 per share and closed its first day up 18%. While many traders were thrilled by this initial gain, looking back, it was a major missed opportunity. The stock has since delivered a 7,736% return, far exceeding the S&P 500\u2019s return of just over 600%. This example illustrates the potential wealth individual stocks can offer compared to broader indices, especially if you choose wisely.\n\"Twenty years ago today, Google went public at a split-unadjusted price of $85 per share. On its first day, the stock closed up 18%. Many traders, thrilled by this initial gain, took the profit. In retrospect, this was one of the greatest mistakes of all time. It has since delivered a 7,736% return, compared to the S&P 500's return of slightly more than 600% with dividends. This serves as a reminder of the wealth that individual stocks can generate compared to indices when you choose wisely. And I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not that hard if you know how to research. So, I think it's time to reconsider the average approach, at least for today.\"\nCramer noted that, despite a strong recent performance\u2014with the Dow gaining 237 points, the S&P 500 up 0.97%, and the NASDAQ increasing by 1.39%\u2014the short-term market outlook is more complex. The market is currently on its longest winning streak since November of last year, with 93% of S&P 500 stocks showing gains.\nHowever, he cautioned that the market might be \"overbought,\" as indicated by the Market Edge oscillator, a tool Cramer has relied on since 1987. When the oscillator reaches plus five or higher, it signals that it might be time to sell. Conversely, readings of minus five or lower indicate oversold conditions, suggesting it's a good time to buy.\n\"Even though it was another good day for the markets. we need to consider both the short-term and long-term outlooks. The short-term setup isn\u2019t as favorable. We\u2019re currently on a significant winning streak, with the market having risen for straight days, the longest streak since November of last year. Impressively, 93% of the S&P 500 stocks are up. \"\nThis follows a Monday when the market dropped sharply due to the Yen carry trade imploding, which led to a wave of forced selling and subsequent panic.\n\"As I've often said, panic is not a strategy. Since that panic, the market has mostly been trending upward.\"\nJim Cramer has also expressed concern about the upcoming Justice Department case challenging the search engine giant's role in the advertising exchange market. This legal issue could have a significant negative impact on it, a company that has greatly benefited from this setup. A victory for the Justice Department could be even more damaging than the previous issue with Apple over default search engine payments, which contributed to its monopoly concerns.\nAccording to Cramer, the resilience of tech giants is evident, with strong recoveries even after short-term dips. (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\nJim Cramer emphasizes that investing in truly exceptional companies, rather than merely following market indices, usually leads to the best returns. Cramer advises investors to avoid panicking during market fluctuations and to maintain their focus on holding strong companies for long-term success.\n\"As we move forward, it's important to remember that investing in truly great companies, rather than just following the index, often yields the best returns. The substantial gain from Google over 20 years exemplifies this. Avoiding panic during market turbulence and sticking with strong companies is crucial for long-term success.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and highlighted ten stocks that he is optimistic about. We also included information on hedge fund sentiment for each stock and ranked them based on how many hedge funds own each one, starting with the least owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer addressed concerns about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock being expensive, suggesting that its strong cash flow justifies the price, rather than just focusing on earnings. He referenced an insightful piece by Ben Rice from Melius, which reinforced the idea of holding onto Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) despite current market signals to sell.\n\"Another firm mentioned that Apple\u2019s stock is expensive, which it is\u2014unless you consider the cash flow instead of just the earnings. The piece by the irrepressible Ben Rice from Melius made so much sense that you know you need to hold on tight and not feel compelled to sell your Apple stock when the market gets overbought, as it is now. The tech titans, the hyperscalers, the colossal portion of the market\u2014yes, the mega stocks\u2014they just come back every time you sell. But short-term signals say to sell. To me, that means it\u2019s time to bunker down and accept the unavoidable small losses. These stocks are just too good to let go. Bottom line: Hold on to them.\"\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s wide-ranging ecosystem, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and services like iCloud and Apple Music, creates a loyal and interconnected customer base. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) consistently grows its revenue due to high demand for its flagship products, particularly the iPhone, and increasing sales in its services segment. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s dedication to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks enhances its investment appeal.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads in technology innovation, with recent product releases such as the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9, which feature advanced camera systems and longer battery life. Strategic investments, including acquiring MLB's Apple TV+ rights and the virtual reality content provider NextVR, position Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to enter new markets and sustain its growth.\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top bullish stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The stock market has fluctuated and reshuffled a lot since the start of last year. A surge in artificial intelligence (AI) has shed light on the vast potential of tech stocks, rallying investors and boosting the Nasdaq Composite by more than 60% since Jan. 1, 2023.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) secured its position as the world's most valuable company by market cap in 2011 and held that spot consistently until this year. The tech giant temporarily lost the top position between January and June of 2024 when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) surpassed Apple, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly achieved a market cap above $3 trillion.\nHowever, Apple's market cap of $3.3 trillion has seen it once again become the world's most valuable company. Yet, Microsoft and Nvidia continue to nip at its heels and could overtake the company for good in the coming years.\nMicrosoft's diversified business model and increasingly established position in AI indicate it could have a more reliable position in tech. Meanwhile, Nvidia's nearly unrivaled dominance in the chip market appears to be the gift that keeps on giving as demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to soar.\nSo, here are two stocks that I predict will be worth more than Apple five years from now.\nNvidia's market cap was $360 billion at the start of 2023 and is now $2.6 trillion, delivering an impressive growth spurt.\nThe company has consistently outperformed Apple in stock growth over the last five years, with its share price up 2,600% compared to the iPhone maker's 330% rise. And that trend is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\nThis chart shows the massive difference in financial growth Nvidia and Apple have experienced over just the last year. While these companies are both leaders in tech, their businesses differ significantly.\nNvidia is profiting from soaring demand for chips, specifically its GPUs. These chips power many products, from cloud platforms to AI models, personal computers, game development engines, and more. Meanwhile, Nvidia has achieved an estimated 70% to 95% market share in GPUs.\nTechnological advances are only likely to continue increasing the demand for powerful chips as companies work to improve their hardware and software offerings. Conversely, Apple has struggled to attract new customers to its products over the last year, with its iPhone and Mac revenue down 10% and 8%, respectively.\nApple is working to expand in AI and will launch a major software update this fall called Apple Intelligence. The update will overhaul its operating systems, introducing various generative features. The company hopes Apple Intelligence will convince millions of consumers to upgrade their devices, as the features will only be accessible with newer products. While the software could boost earnings for the current fiscal year, how Apple will profit from AI over the long term remains to be seen.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia maintains a crucial role in the industry as a leading chipmaker, a position that will likely see it surpass Apple by market cap over the next five years.\nFor years, Microsoft has played second fiddle to Apple on the list of most valuable companies. Apple has consistently outperformed the Windows company in stock growth, rising 330% since 2019 compared to Microsoft's 195%.\nHowever, that trend has shifted in 2024. Microsoft's share price is up 12% year to date, with Apple's up 8%. It's not a huge difference, but Microsoft's head start in AI and potent position in software will likely see it continue to outperform its rival.\nThe AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit nearly $2 trillion in spending. Meanwhile, Microsoft's diverse business model grants it multiple ways to monetize its AI products, thanks to homegrown brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Bing, Xbox, and LinkedIn.\nSince the start of 2023, the company has introduced generative features across its product lineup. This includes new productivity tools on Windows and its Office productivity suite, a revamp of Bing, and multiple AI solutions on its cloud platform Azure. Microsoft has also begun recouping some of its hefty investment in AI, attracting new members to Azure and Microsoft 365. Their respective segments have enjoyed year-over-year sales rises of 12% and 20% in 2024.\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft is outperforming Apple in earnings growth. Over the last three years, Microsoft's quarterly revenue and operating income have risen far higher than Apple's.\nMicrosoft became a behemoth in tech thanks to its success in software. The emergence of AI has given it the opportunity for its unique skill set and product range to shine. The company arguably has more growth potential in AI, which could allow it to overtake Apple in market value before the end of the decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $711,657!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 1, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks and ETFs recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF IWY.\nAll eyes are on technology giant Apple, which is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Aug 1. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.\nApple reclaimed the most valuable title last month and emerged as one of the strongest performers relative to the other \u201cMag 7\u201d amid the recent sell-off. The stock has gained about 28.5% over the past three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 8.4%. The solid trend is expected to continue, given that the tech giant has a strong chance of beating earnings estimates. It has seen positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\nThis has put investors\u2019 focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. The following ETFs have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation. These ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.30% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the fiscal third quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year growth of 6.3% for earnings and 3.2% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.14% in the trailing four quarters (read: Tech ETFs Faceoff: Apple Vs. Microsoft).\nThe stock currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.68 a month ago based on 30 recommendations. Of the 30 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 66.67% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 63.33%, while Buy represented 10%.\nBased on the short-term price targets of 32 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $232.22. The forecasts range from a low of $180.00 to a high of $300.00.\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally turning around following the launch of a brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence for iPhones, iPads and Macs in June. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple (read: Apple Jumps on the AI Bandwagon: ETFs to Buy).\nThe technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. Apple also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which provides customers access to ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost. The company released a beta version of its new iOS 18.1 to developers early this week, offering the first look of Apple Intelligence and some of the iPhone maker's new artificial intelligence features.\nAccording to LSEG data, the tech titan is expected to win back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts and by selling more high-margin iPads with a refreshed design. iPhone sales are expected to decrease 2.2% in the to-be-reported quarter, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter. This suggests that the worst might be over for Apple.\nFor the fiscal third quarter, the iPhone maker expects overall revenues \"to grow low-single digits\" and iPad revenues to grow in double digits.\nVanguard Information Technology ETF - Apple accounts for a 16.1% share.\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF - Apple accounts for a 16% share in the basket.\niShares US Technology ETF - Apple makes up 16.1% of the assets.\niShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF - Apple accounts for a 13.8% share in the basket.\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\nGet it free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 9, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Apple AAPL and HP HPQ.\nIndustry: Computer \u2013 Micro Computers\nLink to article: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2319190/2-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-computer-industry\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry participants are benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones. Industry participants like Apple and HP are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers.\u00a0 However, industry participants are suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Geopolitical challenges, including persistent inflation and high interest, are major headwinds. Weak demand in China has been a headwind.\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung. Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\nEnterprise Adoption RemainsHealthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\nAI-enabled PCs to Boost Demand: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple\u2019s MacOS-based ones, are expected to benefit from AI infusion. Canalys expects AI-enabled PC shipments to reach 48 million in 2024, representing 18% of total PC shipments. AI-capable PC shipments are projected to surpass 100 million in 2025, which will represent 40% of all PC shipments. This offers significant growth opportunities for industry participants.\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #55, which places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\nThe industry\u2019s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group\u2019s earnings growth potential. Since Feb 29, 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this industry\u2019s 2024 earnings has moved up 2.4%.\nGiven the bright outlook, there are many stocks worth watching in the sector. But before we present those stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Micro Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\nThe industry has gained 7.9% over this period compared with the S&P 500\u2019s return of 10.1% and the broader sector\u2019s growth of 11.6%.\nOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 28X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 20.19X and the sector\u2019s 24.64X.\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.27X and as low as 15.54X, with the median being 24.72X.\nApple: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple currently has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping it offer appealing new apps that drive the App Store\u2019s traffic. A growing number of AI-infused apps will attract subscribers to the App Store.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has increased by 1.4% to $6.68 per share over the past 30 days.

        "Title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The stock market has fluctuated and reshuffled a lot since the start of last year. A surge in artificial intelligence (AI) has shed light on the vast potential of tech stocks, rallying investors and boosting the Nasdaq Composite by more than 60% since Jan. 1, 2023.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) secured its position as the world's most valuable company by market cap in 2011 and held that spot consistently until this year. The tech giant temporarily lost the top position between January and June of 2024 when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) surpassed Apple, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly achieved a market cap above $3 trillion.\nHowever, Apple's market cap of $3.3 trillion has seen it once again become the world's most valuable company. Yet, Microsoft and Nvidia continue to nip at its heels and could overtake the company for good in the coming years.\nMicrosoft's diversified business model and increasingly established position in AI indicate it could have a more reliable position in tech. Meanwhile, Nvidia's nearly unrivaled dominance in the chip market appears to be the gift that keeps on giving as demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to soar.\nSo, here are two stocks that I predict will be worth more than Apple five years from now.\nNvidia's market cap was $360 billion at the start of 2023 and is now $2.6 trillion, delivering an impressive growth spurt.\nThe company has consistently outperformed Apple in stock growth over the last five years, with its share price up 2,600% compared to the iPhone maker's 330% rise. And that trend is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\nThis chart shows the massive difference in financial growth Nvidia and Apple have experienced over just the last year. While these companies are both leaders in tech, their businesses differ significantly.\nNvidia is profiting from soaring demand for chips, specifically its GPUs. These chips power many products, from cloud platforms to AI models, personal computers, game development engines, and more. Meanwhile, Nvidia has achieved an estimated 70% to 95% market share in GPUs.\nTechnological advances are only likely to continue increasing the demand for powerful chips as companies work to improve their hardware and software offerings. Conversely, Apple has struggled to attract new customers to its products over the last year, with its iPhone and Mac revenue down 10% and 8%, respectively.\nApple is working to expand in AI and will launch a major software update this fall called Apple Intelligence. The update will overhaul its operating systems, introducing various generative features. The company hopes Apple Intelligence will convince millions of consumers to upgrade their devices, as the features will only be accessible with newer products. While the software could boost earnings for the current fiscal year, how Apple will profit from AI over the long term remains to be seen.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia maintains a crucial role in the industry as a leading chipmaker, a position that will likely see it surpass Apple by market cap over the next five years.\nFor years, Microsoft has played second fiddle to Apple on the list of most valuable companies. Apple has consistently outperformed the Windows company in stock growth, rising 330% since 2019 compared to Microsoft's 195%.\nHowever, that trend has shifted in 2024. Microsoft's share price is up 12% year to date, with Apple's up 8%. It's not a huge difference, but Microsoft's head start in AI and potent position in software will likely see it continue to outperform its rival.\nThe AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit nearly $2 trillion in spending. Meanwhile, Microsoft's diverse business model grants it multiple ways to monetize its AI products, thanks to homegrown brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Bing, Xbox, and LinkedIn.\nSince the start of 2023, the company has introduced generative features across its product lineup. This includes new productivity tools on Windows and its Office productivity suite, a revamp of Bing, and multiple AI solutions on its cloud platform Azure. Microsoft has also begun recouping some of its hefty investment in AI, attracting new members to Azure and Microsoft 365. Their respective segments have enjoyed year-over-year sales rises of 12% and 20% in 2024.\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft is outperforming Apple in earnings growth. Over the last three years, Microsoft's quarterly revenue and operating income have risen far higher than Apple's.\nMicrosoft became a behemoth in tech thanks to its success in software. The emergence of AI has given it the opportunity for its unique skill set and product range to shine. The company arguably has more growth potential in AI, which could allow it to overtake Apple in market value before the end of the decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to invest in since the start of 2023. Its climb centers around the massive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power. A lot of this demand comes from big tech players, but one big tech company recently said no to Nvidia.\nAlthough Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was late to the artificial intelligence game, its product was highly anticipated. To many people's surprise, Apple didn't use Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) to create its AI model. Could this be a sign that Nvidia's GPU empire is starting to crack?\nNvidia's GPUs have become incredibly popular for running AI workloads. Nvidia's GPUs are best in class, and it has industry-leading software available to help squeeze out every bit of performance from the GPUs. This is important as these servers that run AI models contain thousands of GPUs. GPUs are a top choice for this kind of workload because they can perform many calculations in parallel, unlike central processing units (CPUs) found in PCs. They are also good at other tasks, like cryptocurrency mining, engineering simulations, and drug discovery.\nBut because they aren't purpose-built for AI calculations, there is likely a better way to process calculations. These chips exist and aren't made by any of Nvidia's traditional competitors.\nOne of these alternatives is Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tensor processing unit (TPU). Alphabet's TPU was designed specifically for these large AI computations but is limited in flexibility. If a workload is properly set up, TPUs blow Nvidia's GPUs' performance out of the water, but only for specific use cases.\nThis is the primary reason Apple selected Alphabet's TPUs to train its Apple Intelligence model. Does one of the largest players in the industry selecting purpose-built hardware rather than a broader one signify the end for Nvidia?\nPart of the reason some investors (like myself) are hesitant to buy into Nvidia's stock now is the extreme growth expectations built into the company. Anyone buying the stock now assumes that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs will continue to grow significantly. However, they don't consider the possibility that once developers are used to setting up their AI models in a particular way, they may choose to use purpose-built hardware like the TPU.\nThis could be a thesis-breaker for Nvidia, as Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow by 98% this year to $110 billion and by 36% next year to $151 billion. Should demand for its product drop, these projections could be in danger.\nIt's not just Alphabet with its custom design, either. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) both have their own custom chips that are purpose-built for AI model training. Neither of these three companies sells these products directly to the consumer. Instead, if clients want to access them, they must rent them through one of their cloud computing offerings.\nThis is a better long-term business model than Nvidia's, as once Nvidia sells its GPU, the only revenue it will get is from customers deciding to upgrade or replace the unit after its service life is complete. Cloud computing companies buy hardware and then rent the power to clients on a recurring basis, extending the value they can get from one unit.\nStill, all three cloud giants' data centers are filled to the brim with Nvidia's GPUs, and they're all buying more. So, while there may be better ways to train AI models, many companies are still training on GPUs.\nTime will tell whether this trend reverses and more companies train AI models like Apple did or GPUs for broader use continue to dominate. But it's a great point to remember if you're considering investing in Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a scorching-hot buy over the past couple of years, largely due to the key role it plays in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's AI chips are crucial for companies that are developing AI models. And Nvidia has a commanding 80% market share when it comes to AI chips. That's part of the reason why investors have remained bullish on the stock -- it's arguably the best-positioned stock to benefit from growing demand for AI.\nBut given how lucrative the opportunities are in AI, it's only a matter of time before more competitors emerge and fight for market share. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has recently turned to one of those unexpected competitors to source chips for its new AI-powered iPhones.\nOne of the companies that has been developing its own chips is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And Apple has been training its new AI system, called \"Apple Intelligence,\" using Alphabet's custom chips, according to a research paper. The company used two versions of Google's tensor processing unit to develop its AI models, which gives iPhone users access to generative AI features, including advanced writing tools, the ability to generate images, and a Siri assistant with \"all-new superpowers.\"\nAlphabet is a potentially strong competitor for Nvidia to worry about. The company has plenty of resources to work with. Last year, Alphabet generated more than $69 billion in free cash flow. It has been investing in its AI chatbot Gemini, and AI chips could provide it with yet another growth opportunity to pile money into.\nThe courts recently found that the company's search engine, Google, has an illegal monopoly. And depending on what the consequences of that finding are, Alphabet may soon see a huge incentive to find a new growth opportunity to pursue, as the ruling may have a detrimental effect on a key part of its business.\nBeyond Alphabet, however, there are other competitors for Nvidia to worry about. Meta Platforms has been working on an AI chip of its own, as has Amazon. And investors also shouldn't forget about AMD, which is a more traditional rival for Nvidia. Although it has been late to the game, AMD has made it clear that AI is a big priority for the business, and it could also take away some sizable market share from Nvidia in the future.\nNvidia has generated incredible gains due to its dominance in the AI chip space. And it is working on innovating and coming out with more advanced chips to ensure it remains on top. But maintaining such a large market share can be incredibly difficult, especially with so many big tech companies out there with deep pockets to contend with. They aren't simply going to ignore such a massive opportunity in AI chips.\nThe company's revenue has taken off over the past year, with Nvidia's growth rate in recent quarters being well in excess of 200%. Those kinds of numbers, while extremely impressive, are also extremely difficult to maintain. At some point, Nvidia's growth rate will start to come down, especially if more competition emerges in the field. And its high-priced chips may also need to come down in price if that's the case, which may lead to both a slowing growth rate and smaller profit margins than the 50%-plus margins it has been averaging of late.\nNvidia's stock has been giving back some gains in recent weeks, but it's still a top company to invest in if you want exposure to the red-hot AI market. While other companies may try to take market share from Nvidia, that doesn't mean that they will be able to do so overnight.\nNvidia is still in an excellent position to continue growing, but I would expect its growth rate and margins to come down a bit in future quarters, especially as companies potentially reduce AI spending due to a possible economic slowdown. Nvidia's stock may struggle in the near term, but as long you're willing to hang on for the long term, it can still make for a good buy. Still, you should brace for some challenges ahead.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Believes Will Soar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer believes will soar.\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer reflects on Wall Street's favorite GPU maker's remarkable journey and current status in the stock market. After the sharp decline three weeks ago, caused by the sudden sell-off linked to the yen carry trade, the market is rebounding.\n\"We\u2019ve had a remarkable run from the lows three weeks ago as we realized that the forced selling caused by the implosion of the yen carry trade is merely temporary.\"\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate cuts should support this recovery. However, Wall Street has become more selective, and investors are less forgiving of mediocre results now that the market has rallied significantly.\n\"Now the Fed is our friend again with rate cuts on the way, starting at next month\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. At the same time, though, after such a spectacular rally, Wall Street\u2019s gotten a little more discerning. Investors are no longer willing to give companies a pass for less-than-stellar results once we reach more elevated levels. That\u2019s what happens\u2014the exuberance goes away. Now we\u2019re in a tricky moment that feels like a race against time.\"\nCramer emphasizes that the current economic climate is uncertain. The economy is slowing, and while the Fed's rate cuts are expected to help, their impact is unpredictable. The effectiveness of these measures and the extent of the economic downturn remain unclear.\n\"While the economy is slowing and we know the Fed rate-cut cavalry is riding to the rescue, we just don\u2019t know how effective it will be and how bad things will get before Fed Chief Powell manages to turn the tide\u2014and he will. We need to figure out how quickly the economy will deteriorate and how quickly the rate cuts will work their magic. Both of these are judgment calls, and we don\u2019t necessarily have enough data to decide either way. We never do at this point in what we call the economic cycle.\"\nAccording to Cramer, Nvidia has captured extraordinary attention from investors. He describes it as a groundbreaking company, now valued at $3.2 trillion, a dramatic increase from $580 billion just 18 months ago. Cramer highlights its dominance in the semiconductor industry and its influence on technology, particularly in artificial intelligence.\n\"I searched for comparisons and came up grasping at something ethereal to describe this incredible $3.2 trillion company, which was worth just $580 billion 18 months ago. It has captivated not just investors but people far removed from the stock market. It\u2019s almost miraculous how many have had life-changing experiences because of this single stock.\"\nDespite its impressive achievements, Cramer notes that the stock's performance will be scrutinized closely. He points out that the company's quarterly results need to surpass high expectations, including significant revenue beats and strong future guidance.\n\"But tomorrow, the stock will descend into mere mortality, and I feel compelled to explain why. Why does it hold such a high status, and why can it never fully live up to the hype of its $3.2 trillion market cap based solely on one quarterly report? The quarter is about it beating earnings estimates, topping revenue numbers, and crushing forecasts. The stock has run so high that it needs a $2 billion revenue beat and guidance that\u2019s $2 billion higher than expected, along with a bullish conference call discussing a strong roadmap. And let\u2019s not forget a gigantic buyback because the company has too much cash sitting idle.\"\nCramer concludes that the company's technology is so advanced that it\u2019s difficult to fully grasp its future potential. Despite this, he believes the company's achievements should be celebrated, and the stock might still hold significant upside surprises.\n\"The bottom line: I don\u2019t want to be poetic, but it excels in ways that are unmatched. We should celebrate its achievements and bring on those upside surprises.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we examine a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks with strong potential for growth. We also analyze hedge fund perspectives on these stocks and rank them according to hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\nJim Cramer addresses recent changes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s leadership, specifically the retirement of CFO Luca Maestri, a highly regarded executive known for his exceptional financial stewardship. Despite initial market reactions that saw Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock dip slightly and prompted some to view the change with concern, Cramer remains confident in the company's future. Maestri\u2019s tenure saw Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s revenue and earnings grow significantly, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s market cap soaring from $547 billion to nearly $3.5 trillion.\n\"Apple's C-suite is being shaken up, but I'll tell you why it's not shaking my confidence in the company going forward. Own it, don't trade it. Apple's stock briefly got rocked this morning after we learned that CFO Luca Maestri, one of the best in the business, is retiring. Luca is a hero. He's been the steward of Apple's cash and has done his best to add value for all shareholders, much better than almost every other CFO out there. So what happens to the stock upon the news of his retirement? It goes down a buck and a half in pre-market trading, and we get a host of notes saying that Luca's decision is either a mild negative for the stock or a real negative\u2014a reason to be worried and a cause of disappointment and concern.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) offers a strong investment opportunity due to its leadership in technology innovation, growing ecosystem, and solid financial health. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s recent product launches, including the iPhone 15 series, iPad Pro, and new MacBook models, showcase its commitment to cutting-edge technology and have been positively received by consumers, strengthening its market position. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s ecosystem, which integrates its hardware, software, and services, is expanding rapidly. Investments in its Services segment\u2014such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+\u2014along with recent advancements in AI, are boosting recurring revenue and improving customer engagement.\nAdditionally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s strategic investments in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and health technology, including the new Apple Watch Series 9, position it well for future growth and continued market leadership. Overall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s innovation, expanding ecosystem, strong financial standing, and forward-looking investments make it an appealing investment choice.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer believes will soar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nWall Street analysts are urging investors to take advantage of the recent pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Despite the AI giant\u2019s quarterly forecast falling short of the lofty expectations set by investors, who have driven a massive rally in its stock on hopes for generative AI, analysts remain bullish.\nNvidia's shares dropped more than 6% on Thursday after the fiscal Q2 report was released. While the company reported significant growth and profit, the results were viewed as mixed, as revenue and gross margin projections didn\u2019t surpass Wall Street's lofty targets as they had in previous quarters.\nUBS analysts, however, believe investors should \u201cbuy the pullback,\u201d noting that key indicators for Nvidia remain bullish. The bank specifically pointed to the surge in Nvidia\u2019s purchase commitments and supply obligations, describing this as \u201cthe most important metric we watch and a harbinger of future growth.\u201d\nUBS analysts also expressed confidence in Nvidia's margins, stating they are not concerned about gross margins and expect data center margins to stay consistent through the Blackwell cycle, mirroring the stability seen during the Hopper cycle.\nSimilarly, Bank of America analysts reiterated their Buy rating on Nvidia stock following the report and raised the target price from $150 to $165.\nBofA acknowledged that the stock is \u201clikely to be volatile\u201d in the near term due to Nvidia\u2019s projections missing elevated expectations, and noted that rising Blackwell ramp costs could impact Q3 margins.\nNonetheless, BofA remains confident in Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects, stressing that they \u201ccontinue to believe in NVDA\u2019s unique growth opportunity, execution and dominant 80%+ share as generative AI deployments are still in their first 1-1.5 years of what is at least a 3-4 year upfront investment cycle.\u201d\n\u201cAI deployment remains a mission-critical imperative for global cloud and enterprise customers, with NVDA providing the best turnkey model.\u201d\nCiti analysts have elevated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to their \u201ctop AI pick\u201d for 2025, surpassing both Nvidia and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). This move comes as Apple gears up to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup at the \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d product event on September 9th.\nAt the event, Apple is expected to introduce several key updates, including A18 chips utilizing the N3E process with an enhanced neural engine, improved camera and microphone features, and an upgraded modem for the Pro models.\n\u201cApple\u2019s September event is generally all about hardware updates, but we believe the company will put a lot of focus on how the hardware updates for the iPhone 16 family can better support its Apple Intelligence features that are expected to roll out officially later in the fall,\u201d Citi analysts remarked.\nLooking ahead, Citi expects a major refresh with the iPhone 17 next year, with AI features gradually being introduced over the coming year. This phased rollout is expected to give developers time to create apps and allow Apple to build customer recognition.\nCiti projects iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 unit sales to reach 85 million and 92 million in calendar years 2024 and 2025, respectively. Total iPhone units are expected to hit 228 million in 2024 and 241 million in 2025.\nThe analysts also highlighted that \u201cAAPL stock on average outperformed the broader market since 2016 by 5%-6% over the period from June-quarter earnings date into the September iPhone release date.\u201d\nInvestors should be more concerned about the potential bursting of the AI bubble than a looming U.S. or global recession, according to strategists at BCA Research. The firm\u2019s analysis suggests that the risks associated with the rapidly growing AI sector are more serious than those posed by broader economic downturns.\n\"When bubbles burst, the investment priority is to steer well clear of the bursting bubble plus sectors, regions, and countries heavily exposed to it.\" This implies that regardless of whether a recession follows the collapse of the bubble, the primary focus should be on avoiding the areas most impacted by the fallout.\nIn line with this, BCA Research advises investors to underweight U.S. tech and quasi-tech sectors, which are closely tied to the AI boom, and to reduce their exposure to U.S. equities within a global portfolio.\n\"Investors should worry much less about a U.S. or global recession than they should worry about the bubble in anything AI-related,\u201d BCA noted.\nWith the AI sector continuing to attract significant attention and capital, BCA warns that the potential for a sharp correction poses a noteworthy threat.\nWilliam Blair has initiated research coverage of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with an Outperform (Buy) rating, primarily driven by the underappreciated potential of Tesla's energy storage business.\nThe firm believes that Tesla Energy, particularly its Megapack and Powerwall products, could emerge as a significant growth driver, especially as expectations for the electric vehicle (EV) segment moderate in the near term.\n\u201cWe view Tesla Energy as the most underappreciated component of the Tesla story and expect the narrative will shift toward the energy storage business in light of tempered EV expectations in the near term.\"\nThe analysts highlight three key factors that make Tesla's energy storage business a compelling investment: the need for grid stabilization, the expansion of data centers, and the integration of renewable energy sources.\nThese aspects, alongside Tesla's broader automotive business and emerging opportunities in AI, robotaxis, and robotics, position the company as a technology leader with what William Blair describes as an \"Apple-esque ecosystem for the future of energy.\"\n\"Energy is the foundation for life, an abundance or lack of which determines how far society can reach on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\"\nTesla's approach to energy, through its more efficient EVs, energy storage solutions, and innovations like robotaxis and humanoid robots, aims to revolutionize how energy is created, stored, and utilized, with broad societal implications.\nWhile Tesla's current valuation may appear high by traditional metrics, William Blair argues that this premium is justified.\n\"Using traditional comparable analysis with auto or even tech, we understand the difficulty justifying the valuation, but in our opinion, this misunderstands the Tesla story.\"\nThey believe that the halo effect created by Elon Musk, the company\u2019s culture of first principles, and its technological advantages warrant the valuation premium.\nCiti analysts maintained their Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock with a $91 price target, based on an 18% higher-than-consensus CY25 earnings per share (EPS) following the July-quarter results.\nThe investment bank sees Marvell capitalizing on strong AI investments to rapidly expand its AI ASIC business, with four AI ASIC projects in the pipeline\u2014two currently ramping up, one expected in 2025, and another in 2026.\nMoreover, Citi is adding a Positive Catalyst Watch ahead of next week's Technology Conference, where Marvell's CEO Matt Murphy will participate in a fireside chat.\n\"We expect management to sound bullish on AI growth exceeding prior 2024/25 AI sales targets and all non-AI end markets to recover in 2H24,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\"MRVL stock typically outperforms when all its end markets move in the same direction,\u201d they added.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: \u2018Buy Nvidia pullback,\u2019 Apple named Top AI Pick\nMorgan Stanley updated its Dividend Equity Portfolio, dropped this big tech name\nWhat are implications of potential PlayStation 5 Pro launch on Sony's financials\n"

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:\nBTIG upgraded CareDx (CDNA) to Buy from Neutral with a $40 price target following the news last Friday afternoon that Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA decided it will not finalize the more restrictive proposed draft LCD issued in August 2023. Following Friday's update, the 2024 guidance and numbers look increasingly conservative and CareDx's legal matters seem to be manageable in light of Medicare's new approach, BTIG says.\nGordon Haskett upgraded Burlington Stores (BURL) to Buy from Hold with a $300 price target as the firm is raising its Q2 comp growth estimate to 4.0% from 2.0% previously ahead of the company's earnings print. The firm, which expects Burlington's 2.0 Strategy to drive improved comps and margins in the years ahead, notes that quarter-to-date traffic through the first two weeks of Q3 has stayed strong and with a very favorable weather backdrop.\nBTIG upgraded Taylor Morrison (TMHC) to Buy from Neutral with a $78 price target after hosting investor meetings with management last week. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade, and says it has increased confidence in the roadmap for how Taylor Morrison gets to its long-term structural goals beyond the next 12 months.\nLoop Capital upgraded Prog Holdings (PRG) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $55, up from $41, implying 26% upside from current levels. The firm is encouraged by the \"proactive steps\" management has been taking recently to reaccelerate volume growth, including co-branded marketing programs and improved e-commerce checkout integration with existing retail partners and reinvigorating its regional small business.\nRBC Capital upgraded Gates Industrial (GTES) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $22, up from $20. The analyst believes the company's cost savings and footprint optimization will drive margin upside.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nMorgan Stanley downgraded HP Inc. (HPQ) to Equal Weight from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $37. The analyst now sees limited upside to the stock's valuation and consensus estimates.\nPiper Sandler downgraded Shake Shack (SHAK) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $114, down from $121. Coming out of earnings season, the firm is tempering its view on the fast casual sub-sector and for Shake Shack in particular the firm thinks the risk-reward has become more balanced at current levels.\nBenchmark downgraded Codexis (CDXS) to Hold from Buy with no price target. The firm cites negative quarterly earnings comparisons and the extended period of time before the company's long-range projects mature and begin to create more positive growth metrics.\nPiper Sandler downgraded Sweetgreen (SG) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $39, up from $33. Sweetgreen's Infinite Kitchen technology \"remains incredibly encouraging, and is arguably still underappreciated by many in the investment community,\" but the firm thinks the stock's risk/reward has become more balanced at current share levels.\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Hamilton Insurance (HG) to Equal Weight from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $19. With the stock above the firm's price target of $19, the firm believes the upside from here is more limited.\nTop 5 Initiations:\nGoldman Sachs initiated coverage of Lineage (LINE) with a Buy rating and $105 price target. The analyst expects the company's earnings growth will be driven by a re-acceleration in same store operating income growth due to increased demand and a return to more normal seasonality in 2025 and 2026 while cost saving initiatives are realized. Lineage was also initiated at several other firms, including JPMorgan, Mizuho, Baird, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.\nWells Fargo initiated coverage of Concentra (CON) with an Overweight rating and $27 price target. Wells sees Concentra's growth/risk profile as the dominant player in occupational health and strong value for customers as more than offsetting current economic risks, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Concentra was also initiated at JPMorgan, Truist, Mizuho and Goldman Sachs.\nJPMorgan initiated coverage of OneStream (OS) with an Overweight rating and $30 price target. The firm likes the company's customer \"stickiness,\" with 98% gross retention on par with ServiceNow, and organic platform, which it believes creates a foundation for rapid enhancement. OneStream was also initiated at BTIG, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and Wolfe Research, among other firms.\nMoffettNathanson initiated coverage of Apple (AAPL) with a Neutral rating and $211 price target. The \"good news\" is that Apple is \"poised to win in AI,\" but the \"bad news\" is that is \"exactly what's already priced in,\" the analyst tells investors in the firm's initiation note.\nBarclays initiated coverage of Heico (HEI) with an Equal Weight rating and $250 price target. The analyst expects the company's relative growth to moderate as the aerospace aftermarket decelerates.\n"

        "Text": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release earnings results for its third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Aug. 1.\nMeanwhile, some investors are eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company currently has a dividend yield of 0.45%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents a share ($1.00 a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple's $1.00 dividend: $6,000 / $1.00 \u00a0= 6,000 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,332,480 worth of Apple, or 6,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares, or $266,496 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nView more earnings on AAPL\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple rose 1.5% to close at $222.08 on Wednesday.\nAnalysts expect Apple to report quarterly earnings at $1.35 per share, up from $1.18 per share in the year-ago period. The company is projected to post revenue of $84.53 billion, compared to $76.41 billion a year earlier.\nOn Thursday, analysts will also be looking at Apple\u2019s streaming results and its ability to balance ad-free plans with\u00a0ad-supported plans.

        "Title": "UK's competition authority ends probes of Apple and Google but will use incoming powers to 'resolve app store concerns'",
        "Author": "  Natasha Lomas ",
        "Text": "Apple and Google can take a breath after the U.K. competition watchdog announced Wednesday it's closing a pair of investigations into their respective mobile app ecosystems, citing administrative priorities.\nSince March 2021, the U.K. regulator had been investigating Apple\u2019s conduct in relation to the distribution of apps on its iOS and iPadOS mobile devices, with a particular focus on terms and conditions (T&Cs) governing developers\u2019 access to its App Store. Since June 2022, a similar probe had also been looking into Google\u2019s conduct around app distribution on Android devices, including looking at its Play Store rules for its own billing system for in-app purchases. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had said it was concerned the pair's T&Cs may unfairly limit developers' choice.\nThe CMA also previously found substantial grounds for concern over the pair's mobile duopoly.\nNonetheless, it's now shuttered both probes without taking any action.\nBut any relief from Apple and Google at this regulatory reprieve is likely to be brief, as the CMA has said its overarching reason for closing the probes is an expectation of being able to use new competition powers that will allow it to apply special abuse controls on tech giants with strategic market power.\nWriting in a press release, the CMA said it will look to the incoming digital markets regime to \"resolve app store concerns.\"\nIt also wrote that it \"anticipates that its early work under the new digital markets competition regime will build on and leverage its experience in areas it has already studied, such as mobile ecosystems, which includes app stores\" -- giving its clearest signal yet that Apple and Google are first in line for special abuse controls.\nCommenting in a statement, Will Hayter, executive director for digital markets at the CMA, added: \"Once the new pro-competition digital markets regime comes into force, we\u2019ll be able to consider applying those new powers to concerns we have already identified through our existing work.\n\"It\u2019s critical that tech businesses in the U.K., including app developers, can have access to a fair and competitive app ecosystem, helping to grow the sector, boost investment and result in better outcomes for U.K. consumers. These are all factors we are considering before launching our first investigations under the new regime.\"\nThe U.K.'s rebooted digital markets regime has been in the works for years -- greenlit as far back as November 2020 but hit with legislative delays as a result of the political turmoil from chopping and changing conservative governments in recent years.\nFinally, in April last year, the plan was revived and the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer bill ended up being rushed through parliament in the \"wash-up\" ahead of the May 2024 general election -- meaning the CMA is finally poised to wield powers to crack down on Big Tech once the regime comes into force (which it expects \"later this year\").\n\"In light of recent developments, in particular the passing in May of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCCA), the CMA has assessed its existing Competition Act investigation into Google\u2019s Play Store and its parallel case into Apple\u2019s App Store rules against its administrative priorities and decided to close these cases at this point,\" the CMA wrote.\n\"Should Apple or Google each or both be designated as having \u2018strategic market status\u2019 in connection with any digital activities in the mobile sector, the CMA will be able to use its new powers to consider the range of issues raised by parties more holistically than it otherwise could under these specific Competition Act investigations. This will also enable the CMA to consider what, if any, interventions may be needed following any designation.\"\nU.K. developers hoping for the regulator to take swift action to reboot the Apple and Google duopoly will still need to wait longer, though. The DMCCA requires the CMA to undertake investigations to determine whether a tech giant's market power meets the law's bar of \"strategic market status\" (SMS) -- and, if so, designate it as subject to the regime.\nIn January, the CMA said it expected to undertake three to four investigations to determine SMS in the first year of the regime coming into force. So there could still be quite some delay before any U.K. Big Tech crackdown can happen.\nIn one sign of potentially tougher operating conditions coming down the pipe for platform operators under the rebooted approach, it's notable the CMA rejected commitments that had been submitted by Google in response to concerns about Play Store terms under its (now shuttered) investigation. Had the CMA accepted the commitments, it could have limited the scope of remedies it may otherwise order on Google under the digital markets regime, assuming (as is highly likely) it ends up being designated as having SMS.\nThe CMA said Google\u2019s proposals would have given app developers the ability to use alternative payment options to its Play\u2019s billing system, under proposals known as \"Developer-Only Billing\" and \"User Choice Billing.\" But after consulting with developers, and reviewing feedback and available evidence, the CMA said it was not satisfied Google\u2019s proposed commitments addressed its competition concerns effectively -- hence taking the decision to reject it.\n\"Feedback from app developers suggested Google\u2019s proposals to allow app developers to use alternative payment methods for in-app payments did not go far enough and they would in practice remain tied to the Google payment system,\" it wrote. \"In particular, app developers referred to the level of commission they would still be paying to Google, and to the proposed \u2018pop-up screens\u2019 that might put users off completing a transaction.\"\nHow the CMA designs any future interventions on designated tech giants will be one to watch, as the DMCCA gives the regulator leeway to make bespoke interventions tailored to the specific platform and problems it identifies -- setting the U.K.'s approach apart from the more prescriptive competition reboot -- the Digital Markets Act, known as the DMA -- that's already up and running in the European Union.\nHowever, the DMA's fixed list of dos and don'ts have applied to Apple and Google since early March, when the EU regime came into force on designated gatekeepers. So the U.K. continues to lag far behind the bloc when it comes to tackling platform power.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/uks-competition-authority-ends-probes-of-apple-and-google-but-will-use-incoming-powers-to-resolve-app-store-concerns/\n"

        "Text": "Foxconn is hiring more shift workers with higher wages at the world's largest iPhone factory in the Henan provincial capital of Zhengzhou, ahead of the September launch of the 16th edition of Apple's iconic smartphone.\nThe assembler, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, recruited more than 50,000 workers in Zhengzhou over the past two weeks, according to Chinese media reports.\nThe hourly wage at the factory has risen to 26 yuan (US$3.63) in August from 25 yuan in July, while a bonus of up to 7,500 yuan is on offer for returning staff with working experience at the plant, the National Business Daily reported, citing labour agencies.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

During low seasons, the average wage can drop to between 3,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan, as overtime work becomes infrequent.\nFoxconn's officials did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday, outside normal business hours.\nApple's next smartphone launch is one of its most anticipated events as the Cupertino, California-based company is counting on an upgrade with artificial intelligence (AI) built in to boost sales. It set the goal of shipping at least 90 million iPhone 16 devices in the second half of this year, a 10 per cent growth compared to the previous generation.\nApple faces more competitions from local phone makers including Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo. As China's smartphone market accelerated its growth momentum in the second quarter, Apple was squeezed out of top five vendors, with a 3.1 per cent year-on-year decline in shipment despite cutting prices to promote demand, according to data from IDC.\nGreater China, Apple's third-largest market comprising the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, was the only declining regional market for Apple. The tech giant's revenue in the region dropped 6.5 per cent to US$14.73 billion in the June quarter, compared with last year.\nThe uncertainty regarding the fate of much-anticipated Apple Intelligence in China's market could also weigh on iPhone sales in the country.\nDespite relocating some of its production bases out of China, Foxconn signed a deal in late July with the Henan provincial government for a new manufacturing project, for which it will invest 1 billion yuan to build new business headquarters and a research and development centre in Zhengzhou.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Title": "Will TSMC Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have enjoyed a fruitful relationship over the past decade. Back in 2014, Apple shifted its chip orders from Samsung to TSMC\u00a0and funded the Taiwanese chipmaker's initial purchases of ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems.\nTSMC's early adoption of those EUV systems, which optically etch circuit patterns onto the world's smallest chips, helped it pull ahead of Intel in the process race to manufacture more power-efficient chips. It also gained Apple as its top customer and attracted a lot more attention from fabless chipmakers like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Qualcomm.\nApple's shift to TSMC curbed its dependence on Samsung, which had rapidly evolved from its leading supplier into a major competitor in the smartphone market. It also supported its production of first-party chips and reduced its dependence on third-party components.\nOver the past 10 years, TSMC's stock has soared 716% and boosted its market cap to $885 billion. Apple's stock rallied 793% and lifted its valuation to $3.47 trillion. But could TSMC become the more valuable tech giant by 2030?\nFrom 2016 to 2023, TSMC's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13%, while its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 15%. Most of that growth was driven by the expanding smartphone market. It also thrived throughout the pandemic as more workers upgraded their PCs for remote work and online classes, while the growth of the artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0market spurred the market's demand for new data center chips.\nAs the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC's sales usually ebb and flow with the semiconductor sector's cyclical growth cycles. Its growth decelerated in 2018 and 2019 as the memory chip market cooled off, and its revenue declined in 2023 as the 5G upgrade cycle ended and global PC\u00a0shipments declined.\nBut this year, TSMC expects the growth of the AI market, rising smartphone sales, and the stabilizing PC market to lift its sales again. In the second quarter of 2024, it generated 52% of its revenue from the high-performance computing (HPC) market -- which includes Nvidia, AMD, and other AI chipmakers. That segment grew 28% sequentially, outpacing all its other end markets. Its smartphone revenue, which still accounted for 33% of its top line, dipped 1% sequentially.\nAnalysts expect TSMC's revenue to increase 30% in 2024, 24% in 2025, and 18% in 2026, and for its EPS to grow at a CAGR of 25% from 2023 to 2026. But to maintain that momentum, TSMC will need to successfully ramp up the production of its 3-nanometer (nm) chips and start manufacturing its newest 2nm chips by early 2025.\nIf TSMC sticks to that schedule, it should maintain its lead in the closely watched process race. It will also remain the linchpin and bellwether of the semiconductor sector for the foreseeable future. However, its growth could still be disrupted by a recession; a conflict between China, the U.S., and Taiwan; and Intel's loss-leading expansion of its first-party foundries.\nAssuming TSMC matches Wall Street's expectations, grows its EPS at a CAGR of 20% from 2026 to 2031, and still trades at 22 times forward earnings by the beginning of 2030, its stock could reach about $550 per share. That would represent a 220% gain from its current price, but it would only boost its market cap to about $2.85 trillion.\nThat would still make TSMC less valuable than today's Apple. Apple might face some headwinds through the end of the decade as its iPhone sales cool off and regulatory headwinds curb the growth of its services segment. However, I believe it could easily grow its EPS at a steady CAGR of at least 15% from fiscal 2023 (which ended last September) through fiscal 2031 as it ramps up its massive buybacks. If it merely clears that lowest bar and keeps trading at a reasonable 20 times forward earnings, its stock could rise to about $350 by 2030. That would boost its market cap by more than 50% to $5.35 trillion.\nSo, for now, it's unlikely that TSMC's market cap will eclipse Apple's by 2030. That said, TSMC might still outperform Apple as an investment as it benefits from the broader expansion of the broader semiconductor market. Apple still has plenty of irons in the fire, but it faces much tougher competitive and regulatory challenges than TSMC.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Apple Intelligence is the best reason yet to finally upgrade to an Apple Silicon Mac",
        "Author": "  Michael Grothaus ",
        "Text": "Back in 2020, Apple entered a new era. It released its first Apple Silicon chips and with them said goodbye to the Intel chips that had powered its Mac computers since the early 2000s. Apple Silicon chips, also known as the company\u2019s M-series chips, gave Macs a major boost over their Intel counterparts, not just in processing power but in energy efficiency, too.\nThe latest Apple Silicon MacBook Air with the M3 chip is a staggering 13 times faster than the most powerful Intel-base MacBook Air. The M3 chips\u2019 energy efficiency also gives the laptop up to a third more battery life (18 hours for the Apple Silicon MacBook Air versus 12 hours for the Intel MacBook Air).\nMost Read from Fast Company\nFall Foliage Map 2024: Best dates to enjoy the season\u2019s changing colors in your area\nDirecTV-Disney dispute update: Companies blame each other as ESPN and ABC go dark at the start of football season\nNordstrom Rack is opening almost two dozen new locations in 2024. Here\u2019s a full list and map\nBut Apple Silicon Macs don\u2019t just benefit from hardware advantages over their Intel counterparts. Ever since 2020, Apple has limited some software capabilities to its Apple Silicon Macs. And with the release of macOS Sequoia this fall, one of the latest Apple Silicon Mac software exclusives is also the best reason those who still have Intel-based Macs should upgrade.\nThis fall, Apple will bring its long-awaited AI platform, dubbed Apple Intelligence, to its iPhones, iPads, and Macs. However, when it comes to Macs, there\u2019s a big caveat: only Apple Silicon Macs will gain Apple Intelligence support. Even though many Intel-based Macs will be able to run macOS Sequoia, those Macs won\u2019t be able to run Apple Intelligence.\nNow, it\u2019s easy to be cynical about this and claim that Apple is placing artificial restrictions on which Macs can and cannot run Apple Intelligence in order to boost sales, but the truth is there are fundamental technical reasons Apple Intelligence won\u2019t run on Intel Macs. Most notably, Intel chips in Macs are all at least four years old and nowhere near powerful enough to reliably run artificial intelligence tasks. But Apple Silicon chips are.\nYou\u2019ll need a Mac with at least an M1 processor to run Apple Intelligence. Apple Silicon chips will be able to handle the processing power for the new, advanced Siri; the generative text tools that help you refine your emails and messages; and the generative art tools that can create custom images and even custom emojis on the fly.\nAs already mentioned, Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t the only exclusive software limited to Apple Silicon Macs. The Mac\u2019s next operating system, called macOS Sequoia, has another Apple Silicon-exclusive feature. The Notes app on Apple Silicon Macs gains live audio transcription, so your M-series Mac can automatically transcribe an audio recording you insert into the note\u2014a great productivity feature.\nAnd Apple Silicon-exclusive features aren\u2019t even limited to the upcoming macOS Sequoia. If you still have an Intel Mac, you are missing out on other existing macOS capabilities including the ability to use hand gestures to create augmented reality effects when on a FaceTime call and the ability to overlay yourself on top of content, such as slide decks, that you share while on a video call.\nDictation features built into macOS are vastly superior on Apple Silicon Macs. You can dictate text in any text field without an internet connection. Another great feature exclusive to Apple Silicon Macs is called Live Captions. This feature displays real-time subtitles on your Mac\u2019s screen across various apps including FaceTime when on a video call or when listening to podcasts in the Podcasts app. Real-time captioning makes it easier to follow along if you have trouble hearing someone or are in a place where you can\u2019t boost your Mac\u2019s volume up too loud.\nAnd if you\u2019re an Apple Maps fan, know that the Mac Apple Maps app displays a lot more details in its maps on Apple Silicon Macs than it does on Intel Macs. These include additional elements like trees, roads, landmarks, buildings, and elevation in select cities. Finally, Apple Maps on Apple Silicon Macs allows you to view the earth as an interactive 3D globe\u2014something Intel Macs miss out on entirely.\nOne of the main benefits of buying a Mac over a PC is its incredibly long lifespan. I\u2019ve had Macs that were completely usable even 10 years after purchasing them (even though the Macs could no longer receive software updates).\nBut in 2024, the technology landscape is changing and we are entering a new era of computing\u2014one driven by artificial intelligence. So even though your Intel Mac may still be able to run the upcoming macOS Sequoia, there\u2019s a good argument to be made that it\u2019s time to upgrade to a modern Apple Silicon Mac\u2014you\u2019ll need to if you want to use Apple Intelligence.\nOf course, the drawback of upgrading to a Mac, as opposed to a PC, is the price. An entry-level Apple Silicon M3 iMac starts at $1,299 and an M2 MacBook Air starts at $999\u2014not exactly cheap.\nBut there are deals to be had if you know where to look. Apple sells refurbished items on its online store, where you can often save hundreds of dollars on Apple Silicon Macs. And if you have an existing monitor and keyboard, the $599 entry-level M2 Mac mini is an affordable option to get into Apple Silicon (and it\u2019s only $499 with an education discount).\nFinally, perhaps the best Apple Silicon laptop deal you can get comes not from Apple, but from Walmart. The retail giant currently exclusively sells the M1 MacBook Air for just $699, and often has it on sale for even less than that.\nmacOS Seqoia will be released to the public next month. An update to macOS Sequoia with Apple Intelligence included is expected to be released in October.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

But the economy is going down,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer said that the Monday selloff was \u201cvicious enough\u201d to make any investor think why they should stay in the market, but that\u2019s exactly \u201cwhat you have to do.\u201d He thinks the latest decline is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\nJim Cramer said that the selloff started because money managers who were borrowing money from Japan to invest in US stocks were caught with their \u201cpants down\u201d when Japan increased interest rates. As a result, these funds were forced to sell their stocks. He thinks it\u2019s not possible to call a bottom on this decline yet \u201cuntil we know these sellers are done unwinding their trades.\u201d\nCramer said that another key reason why investors were selling on Monday was the notion that the Fed is late on cutting rates. But Cramer said a 25 bps rate cut wouldn\u2019t have mattered a lot and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees there is a need for an urgent rate cut, he\u2019d do it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got horse sense,\u201d Cramer said.\nJim Cramer said there are no \u201csafe havens\u201d in tech and while he reiterated his bullish view on some notable tech stocks, he advised investors to be ready for \u201cpain\u201d in the near term if they want to invest in technology.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t take the pain, then get the heck out of it.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nJim Cramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0 posted a \u201cthin\u201d top and bottom line beat despite \u201csevere\u201d in China.\n\u201cMarket is so negative on tech, they are not gonna give they benefit of the doubt, they never do,\u201d Cramer said.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the limelight after the company posted decent quarterly results, where declines in iPhone sales were more than offset by services revenue and Mac sales gains. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock and increased his price target to $285 from $275.\n\u201cApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence rollout has already begun with developers who will significantly enhance app capabilities as the company staggers the launch of its new AI feature along with its OpenAI partnership which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0 expects ChatGPT and all other features to be integrated into the iPhone and other devices by the end of the year. We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front and adds $30 to $40 per share.\u201d Ives said.\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at \u201csome point\u201d to take advantage of Apple Intelligence. \u00a0The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u00a0is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s \u2018Ignore the Chatter\u2019 Guide: 10 Stocks to Buy Today.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Jim Cramer-approved stocks.\nOn his Friday show, Jim Cramer discussed the \"tyranny of larger macro forces,\" lamenting how the market has become overly fixated on broad economic indicators like interest rates and the Fed's actions instead of keeping their eyes on the prize\u2014great stocks with great stories.\nThe \u201cshort-term guessing game based on the data point of the day\u201d can blindside investors to the long-term glory of what is in front of them, according to Cramer, who also expressed his disdain for ETFs by stating:\n\u201c..there could be a pickup in semiconductors if the economy accelerates so we buy an ETF that has semis rather than just going after Nvidia for AI or Texas Instruments for the Internet of Things.\u201d\nThe backdrop to these comments was the U.S. stock market experiencing a significant rally following the release of encouraging jobless claims data. The S&P 500 jumped by 2.3%, reflecting widespread gains across multiple sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by 683 points, highlighting strong performance among blue-chip stocks, while the NASDAQ Composite climbed 2.87%, driven by a rebound in technology and growth stocks.\nThis rebound helped the S&P 500 recover nearly all losses from earlier in the week, when recession fears and the unwinding of a global yen-funded carry trade led to a sharp decline.\nAnalyzing Jim Cramer\u2019s recent \u201cMad Money\u201d episodes, we made a list of 10 stocks that the veteran CNBC host is bullish on. These are companies that are well-poised for long-term growth, given that investors are able to hold their ground and \u201cignore the chatter.\u201d\nThe reason we track what hedge funds are doing and their favorite stocks is simple. Our\u00a0research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nCramer called the iPhone-maker \u201cthe usual suspect of the Magnificent 7\u201d, explaining how blue-chip tech led the session after news of encouraging jobless claims hit the market on Friday morning.\nMorgan Stanley recently maintained its \"Buy\" rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $273, highlighting the stock's potential for a 28.4% upside. This optimistic outlook is driven by expectations of an \"iPhone supercycle\" and the anticipated impact of Apple's upcoming innovations, including the iPhone 16 and the Apple Vision Pro.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) in the second quarter, including a substantial reduction in its Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) holdings.\nWhat Happened: Buffett's company sold over 389 million Apple shares in the second quarter, according to the company's latest U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday. Despite the sale, Berkshire Hathaway still holds 400 million Apple shares.\nThe news that Buffett had sold a significant portion of Apple shares was revealed in Berkshire's earnings report earlier this month, but the precise number of shares sold only became clear on Wednesday.\nTrending:\nDon\u2019t miss out on the next NVIDIA \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement.

Discover the potential of this market before other investors.\nWhy It Matters: Buffett's investment decisions have always been closely watched due to his remarkable track record. This recent move comes at a time when Berkshire Hathaway's stock is up over 20% year-to-date, despite trailing the broader stock markets for much of the year due to its large holding in Apple.\nEarlier in August, Buffett's decision to sell nearly half of Berkshire's Apple stock was seen by Elon Musk as an indication of an impending market correction.\nGlobal market volatility has also tested Buffett's investments. Despite a significant initial plunge, Berkshire's $20 billion investment in Japanese trading giants recovered most of its losses. The global market turmoil triggered by Japan's rate hike had a limited impact on these investments.\nBuffett's recent stock sales have also contributed to Berkshire's cash reserves swelling to a record $277 billion. This increase in cash reserves comes despite a 15.5% year-over-year fall in the company's second-quarter net earnings, largely due to a decline in investment gains amid volatile market conditions.\nPrice Action: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Class A stock closed at $657,122.00 on Wednesday, marking a gain of 1.24%. Year-to-date, it has risen by 19.52%. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Class B stock finished at $438.47 on the same day, up by 1.40%. In after-hours trading, it increased 0.14%. Year-to-date, the stock has appreciated 20.97%, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "Title": "Forget Apple, the biggest loser in the Google search ruling could be Mozilla and its Firefox web browser",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "\u201cGoogle is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\nWith those words from United States District judge Amit Mehta on Monday, Google suffered a historic antitrust case loss at the hands of the U.S. Department of Justice. Mehta, the judge presiding over the trial, ruled that the tech giant has illegally maintained a monopoly through the billions of dollars in annual payments it makes to partners to secure the default search engine position on popular web browsers and mobile phones. With those dominant positions locked in, the argument goes, other competitors in the search and search advertising businesses have no chance of competing effectively.\nThe ruling immediately prompted speculation about the impact to Apple, which receives as much as $20 billion from Google every year in exchange for putting the search engine front-and-center on its iPhones via the Apple Safari web browser.\nBut while Apple would certainly take a big hit if the ruling is upheld, Apple is a large, diversified company with many sources of revenue. That's not the case for another partner of Google's located in the fallout zone of Monday's ruling: Mozilla, the non-profit tech org that makes the Firefox web browser.\nWhen users of Firefox type a search term into the browser, the query is automatically routed to Google's search engine. The arrangement is vital for Mozilla. According to the Mozilla Foundation's 2021-2022 financial statement, which is the most recent published, $510 million out of its $593 million in revenue came courtesy of Google's search payments.\nIf that number $510 million were to go away entirely, Mozilla will have a serious problem on its hands.\nMozilla is putting on a brave face for now, and not directly addressing the existential threat that the ruling appears to pose.\n\"Mozilla has always championed competition and choice online, particularly in search,\" a spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune on Monday. \"We're closely reviewing the court's decision, considering its potential impact on Mozilla and how we can positively influence the next steps...Firefox continues to offer a range of search options, and we remain committed to serving our users' preferences while fostering a competitive market.\"\nFor Mozilla, which first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as a community-driven project to challenge Microsoft's stranglehold on the web browser market via Internet Explorer, Monday's ruling is the latest setback in a quest to find relevance in a market dominated by Big Tech companies. Mozilla laid off about 60 staffers earlier this year and saw its CEO step down.\nYou can be sure that critics of the judge's ruling will highlight the potentially devastating impact on Mozilla to make the case that the antitrust ruling will have unintended consequences on smaller tech industry players. Others might argue that Mozilla hasn't done enough with those spoils to differentiate its Firefox browser, or that it could cut a deal with another search engine like Bing if its Google deal goes away completely.\nEither way, Google will appeal the suit so a long battle may ensue. And there's another big domino to fall: the judge will rule on the remedy or remedies \u2014 essentially, the business-model penalties \u2014 that Google will face.\nEvercore ISI research analyst Mark Mahoney tacked them off in a research note on Monday evening:\n\"The\u00a0exact remedy is key, and so far, it\u2019s hard to pick a winning horse\u00a0among a range of outcomes,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"\u00a0i) forbidding payment from Google altogether, ii) a cap on the amount of distribution agreement fees,\u00a0iii) pushing Apple to implement a \u201cchoice screen\u201d, or iv) something\u00a0else? In any case, we expect at least another 6 months to a year before we would know the exact remedies (or longer if the judge\u00a0decides to stay the remedies phase pending GOOG\u2019s appeal).\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Why Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Dividend Stock According to Warren Buffett?",
        "Author": "  Vardah Gill ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Warren Buffet-approved dividend stocks.\nWarren Buffett is a well-known figure in the investment community, and his reputation requires no introduction. He is one of those rare investors whose strategies are closely emulated by countless newcomers to the field. This widespread admiration stems from the fact that Buffett operates in a class of his own. He remains committed to the investment principles he has relied on throughout his career, particularly value investing. The Oracle of Omaha\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the current AI trend highlights his steadfast dedication to the strategies that have guided his investment approach for decades.\nAt the Berkshire annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett was asked about AI's potential impact on traditional industries. He responded by acknowledging that he was not knowledgeable about the technology but emphasized that this lack of understanding did not imply he dismissed its existence, importance, or significance in any way. That said, Buffett is also enthusiastic about several other strategies beyond value investing.\nAlso read: Warren Buffett Disciple Guy Spier\u2019s 10 High Conviction Stock Picks\nDividend stocks have been a staple in Berkshire's portfolio for a long time, with nearly 93% of the holdings focused on them. The media has often highlighted Buffett's affinity for dividend stocks, particularly because Berkshire Hathaway, his own company, does not pay a dividend. His approach has proven successful, as the investment portfolio managed by Buffett and his team is projected to generate around $6 billion in annual dividend income. Remarkably, $4.36 billion of that income from common and preferred stock dividends comes from just five companies.\nBuffett\u2019s approach to dividend investing isn\u2019t driven by chasing the highest yield. Instead, he prioritizes identifying outstanding companies that can maintain and grow their dividends over the long term. He prefers a moderate yield from a stable, successful company over a higher yield from a less reliable and weaker one. If Warren Buffett has a preference for dividends, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s on the right track, given how significantly these stocks have contributed to overall market returns. His love for dividend stocks reflects the significant role these equities have played in contributing to the market's overall returns over the years. Between 1993 and the end of 2022, the S&P 500 grew by 777%. However, when dividends were factored in, the S&P 500 saw an increase of over 1,400% during the same period. This indicates that dividends accounted for more than 20% of the market\u2019s total return during those years.\nBuffett carefully monitors the sectors and industries he invests in, which is a core aspect of his investment strategy. By the end of Q2 2024, the finance sector was the largest portion of his portfolio, followed closely by technology, with substantial investments also in basic materials and consumer goods. This article will explore some of the best Warren Buffett dividend stock selections across these different sectors and industries.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this article, we analyzed Berkshire Hathaway's 13F portfolio as of the second quarter of 2024 and picked dividend stocks from the portfolio. We mentioned the sectors and industries these stocks belong to and ranked them in ascending order of the hedge fund's stake in them during Q2 2024.\nWe also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s Stake Value: $84,248,000,000\nSector: Information Technology\nIndustry: Consumer Electronics\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tops our list of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks. The hedge fund reduced its massive stake in the tech giant during the second quarter of 2024, which was unexpected given Buffett\u2019s reputation for long-term investing. The fund's AAPL stake was valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, indicating that Buffett had sold just over 49% of the tech investment. Despite this reduction, the company remained by far Berkshire's largest stock holding. Buffett had already cut the Apple stake by 13% in the first quarter and mentioned at the Berkshire annual meeting in May that the sales were partly for tax reasons. He suggested that selling \"a little Apple\" this year could benefit Berkshire shareholders in the long run if future US tax policy increases capital gains taxes to address a growing fiscal deficit. The company represented over 30% of the firm's 13F portfolio.\nWhere Berkshire slashed its AAPL stake, Baron Funds reinitiated its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) during the second quarter of 2024. The firm highlighted the strengths in the company's business in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company\u2019s attached services \u2013 including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2013 provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company\u2019s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2013 the AI strategy unveiled at Apple\u2019s recent Worldwide Developer Conference \u2013 leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem.

We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported strong earnings in its fiscal Q3 2024. The company's revenue for the quarter came in at $85.7 billion, which saw a 4.8% growth from the same period last year. In addition, its cash position was also stable, generating $29 billion in operating cash flow. The company returned $32 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.44%, as of August 21. In May this year, the company raised its dividend for the 12th consecutive year.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a popular stock among elite funds during Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database. The hedge fund positions in the company jumped to 184 in Q2, from 150 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a collective value of more than $124 billion.\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It also claimed that many AI use cases are \u201cnever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\u201d The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver \u201cvalue commensurate with the hype\u201d.\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are \u201cfew real uses\u201d of AI other than \u201csummarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding\u201d.\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from \u201cbubble\u201d stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it\u2019s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\nHere is what Insider Monkey\u2019s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management\u2019s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\u201cI have been saying that NVDA\u2019s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don\u2019t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That\u2019s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn\u2019t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That\u2019s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.\u201d\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer\u2019s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple is an important part of the Mag. 7 group which Elliott Management is bearish on.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI initiative Apple Intelligence has started to make sense to Wall Street analysts. Recently, Baird raised its price target on the stock to $240 from $200, citing a potential upgrade cycle in iPhone because of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence.\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at \u201csome point\u201d to take advantage of Apple Intelligence. \u00a0The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u00a0is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He\u2019s Buying.

        "Title": "Apple Just Exposed a Massive Risk for Nvidia Stock",
        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) nearly $3 trillion valuation hinges on a critical assumption: The company's utter dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market is sustainable. Nvidia's market share has been estimated as high as 95%, and while competitors including AMD and Intel offer AI chips of their own, they've made little headway against the Nvidia juggernaut.\nHere's the problem: That assumption is probably not going to hold up in the long run. Nvidia has some important advantages, including a mature software ecosystem and best-in-class hardware, but cracks are starting to form. The biggest crack so far is Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) decision to avoid Nvidia's GPUs entirely while training its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence platform.\nApple is late to the generative AI party, but it's now full steam ahead bringing AI features to its iPhones, Macs, and other devices. Apple Intelligence, which will go into beta later this year, includes AI-powered writing tools, image creation capabilities, a version of Siri that isn't embarrassing, and other useful features. None of this is groundbreaking, but these features will be deeply integrated into Apple's ecosystem and available to the company's massive user base.\nApple has trained multiple AI models, including powerful server-based models that will run in the cloud and more compact models that will run directly on Apple devices. Training an AI model is computationally intensive, and Nvidia's GPUs have been the standard choice since the AI boom began. Apple notably took a different route.\nApple detailed the AI models that power Apple Intelligence in a recent research paper, and the big surprise is that the tech giant shunned Nvidia's GPUs entirely. The server-based models were trained on 8,192 TPUv4 AI chips from Alphabet's Google, while the on-device models were trained on a smaller number of TPUv5 AI chips.\nGoogle has been designing custom AI chips for years. The company's sixth-generation TPU, called Trillium, was announced in May. Google uses its custom chips to train its own AI models, and now Apple has chosen to do the same.\nApple's decision kills the argument that Nvidia's GPUs are the only game in town for AI training.\nThe AI chip market could grow fast enough for Nvidia's revenue to continue to rise at a healthy pace even if it loses market share. However, it's hard to imagine that Nvidia will be able to maintain its sky-high profit margins as competition chips away at its dominance.\nNvidia reported a net income of $14.9 billion on $26 billion in revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, ended April 28. It is highly unlikely that Nvidia will be able to maintain a net income margin above 50% in the long run. Competition will inevitably bring the company's profitability back down to earth.\nAI inference, the act of using trained AI models, doesn't necessarily require powerful GPUs at all. Intel's latest Xeon server CPUs, for example, can run some inference workloads, and PCs with dedicated AI chips are set to become the norm. AI training does require powerful accelerators, but Apple's choice to avoid Nvidia's GPUs is a strong sign that Nvidia's dominance of the AI training market is coming to an end.\nNvidia's AI growth story has been incredible, but Apple just delivered a serious blow to the AI king.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $669,193!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future. Munster referred to a latest interview of Mark Zuckerberg in which he said if his company does not keep spending on AI it may miss the biggest opportunity in the next 10-15 years. Munster said Zuckerberg believes this AI spending \u201ccannot slow down.\u201d\n\u201cI am most optimistic because that CapEX number, if you\u2019re gonna boil it down to one point, it\u2019s gonna be higher for longer and it\u2019s good for AI.\u201d\nAsked whether investors should stick with mega-cap AI stocks or move on to smaller companies that could benefit from this AI spending, Munster said that depends on to what degree you believe in the transformative power of AI.\n\u201cIf you are in my camp.. which I think it (AI) will be more transformative than the internet, then small companies and the big companies are going to participate.\u201d\nMunster thinks the AI-led bull market could last for 3-5 years before ending in what he called a \u201cspectacular bubble burst.\u201d\nFor this article we picked the AI stocks Gene Munster and his firm Deepwater Asset Management hold, according to the disclosures on CNBC.

Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it\u2019s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a significant share price rise of 22% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at Apple\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n See our latest analysis for Apple \nAccording to our valuation model, Apple seems to be fairly priced at around 7.7% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $239.78, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Apple\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 36% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in AAPL\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AAPL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIf you want to dive deeper into Apple, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Apple and we think they deserve your attention.\nIf you are no longer interested in Apple, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Warren Buffett and hedge funds.\nWarren Buffett will go down in history as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, a feat achieved through integrity, wisdom and wit. He is dubbed the Oracle of Omaha on his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, delivering a compounded annual gain of 19.8% since 1958, more than double an increase of 9.9% for the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway stock has gained over 3,787,464% since 1965 compared to a 24,708% gain for the S&P 500, underlining Buffett's stock-picking skills.\nBuffett is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street having amassed a wealth of $138 billion, as reported by Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. His net worth could have been much more had he not made generous contributions to various charitable organizations. In contrast to many other billionaires who prefer lavish lifestyles in large homes and luxury vehicles, Buffett is often seen as one of the most humble billionaires globally.\nThe significant investment gains over the years stem from Buffett buying stocks in various sectors and holding them for years and even decades. Buffett's secret to prosperity mainly lies in investing in well-established, reputable companies with clear competitive edges. Although this approach focuses heavily on undervalued stocks, it also occasionally includes investments in high-growth companies.\nThe investment strategy is often backed by the massive cash haul that Berkshire Hathaway holds on generating earnings per share on most of its investments and through dividend payments. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about a particular clique of stocks.\nHigh-growth companies and market leaders in respective fields are some of the factors that Buffett and most hedge funds closely watch while selecting stocks.\u00a0 Technology stocks which consist of some of the biggest companies account for 41% of Buffett's 13F portfolio at the end of March, an edge that has always allowed him to outperform the overall market.\nDiversification is another important factor in the top stocks that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. While technology stocks account for the biggest share, the billionaire investor is also heavily invested in Financials at 21% and Basic Material at 10.7%. Diversifying aligns with the billionaire investor value investing principles that involve pursuing undervalued investments in various sectors.\nOver the years, Buffett has always sought securities whose prices are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Rather than focusing on short-term gains in the market, the Berkshire Hathaway chief selects stocks based on their long-term potential. It was one of the reasons that Berkshire Hathaway shares ended 2023 with a 15.8% gain, representing an eighth straight year of advances. Its biggest increase of 29.6% came in 2021 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway had $189 billion in cash as of the end of the first quarter, the cash haul is expected to surge to $300 billion by the end of the third quarter. While most people might wonder why Buffett is not putting much of the cash to work, the billionaire investor is always cautious focusing on value investments rather than just investing for the sake.\nThe billionaire investor is always driven by the mantra: never invest in overvalued equities. Therefore he always takes time scanning for value investments trading at discounted valuations. Additionally, the sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means it can only put its money into a select few companies that will significantly impact its returns. This is further compounded by the fact that investments in cash equivalents, such as short-term government bonds, are currently offering returns above 5% which is quite high at current levels. As a result, Warren Buffett and his firm are deliberately seeking the perfect investment at the perfect price, and this opportunity could arise at any moment.\nIn the recent past, Buffett has also gone against the wave amid a shift of focus from oil and gas investment plays amid the transition to clean energy. Buffett remains bullish about investment opportunities in the energy sector amid the carbon care initiatives even as the biggest players continue generating significant returns from the lucrative fossil fuel business. Buffett and hedge funds have also taken keen interest in stocks offering exposure to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence that are driving valuations higher in the market.\nIn this article, we take a look at some of the top stocks in which Buffett and other hedge funds are heavily invested. Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about these 10 stocks partly because of their growth metrics and long-term prospects. While some of the stocks are trading at a premium valuation, they are market leaders in their respective fields and, therefore, well-positioned to generate long-term value. We have ranked the stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio based on the number of hedge funds invested and selected the top 10.\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market capitalization and is one stock that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. The company stands out owing to its leading iPhone product line, which has always been the key driver of revenues. Likewise, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is increasingly reducing its reliance on hardware sales, focusing on services led by Apple Music, cloud computing and App Store.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) confirmed that the integration of a slew of artificial intelligence features into its hardware is one factor expected to reinvigorate demand for its iPhones, which has slowed in the recent past. With AI expected to inject new life into Apple products, it remains one of the stocks worth paying attention to.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains Buffett's biggest holding, with stakes worth $135.36 billion despite trimming stakes by 13% in the first quarter. A total of 150 hedge funds held stakes in the company as of the end of the first quarter, an improvement from 131 as of the aid of 2023.\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett and hedge funds. You can visit Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks\u00a0to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's hard to overstate the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) has altered the technology landscape since early last year, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the ranks of the world's most valuable businesses.\nWhile the No. 1 position has changed hands several times over the past 12 months, it's currently occupied by Apple. The company's recent AI announcements have energized the Apple faithful, driving its market cap to $3.4 trillion.\nWith its full-court press into AI, Microsoft takes up the No. 2 spot at $3.1 trillion. Nvidia, with its industry-leading AI chip, has doubled over the past year to earn the No. 3 spot at $2.9 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with solid AI game plans of their own -- are also members of this exclusive fraternity, with market caps of $2.1 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively (as of market close on Wednesday).\nWith a market cap of just $41 billion, it might seem like an exaggeration to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might have a shot at joining the $1 trillion club. However, the strong, accelerating demand for servers designed to harness the power of AI -- and the company's years of experience in the field -- suggest Supermicro might have the qualities needed for membership.\nWhile Supermicro has only recently caught the attention of AI-centric investors, the company has been serving up custom-designed servers for more than three decades. This track record of experience served Supermicro well when those wanting to harness the power of generative AI came calling.\nThe company's claim to fame is its track record of developing power-miserly, rack-scale servers that boast a lower cost of ownership. Yet these cost-efficient systems are still able to provide the computational horsepower necessary to harness the power of AI and hyperscale data centers.\nFurthermore, Supermicro's building-block architecture ensures it can create a system to accommodate any budget or technology level. Finally, partnerships with the most important names in AI chips, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, ensure a steady supply of the most in-demand processors.\nThis successful strategy has helped generate meteoric growth. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.8 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.56 soared 329%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year revenue guidance to $14.9 billion, which would represent growth of 109%.\nManagement said Supermicro grew 5 times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is gaining market share. Analysts at Northland came to the same conclusion, noting the company has increased its market share from 8% to 11%, with \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nFinally, in a nod to Supermicro's importance within the broader market, the stock was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index on July 22.\nSupermicro has the inside track when compared to its rivals. When demand for AI servers ratcheted up last year, the company was nimble enough to adjust on the fly. Its strong relationships with all the top AI chipmakers gave Supermicro a steady supply of the processors needed to outfit its high-end servers. That said, it will be some time before Supermicro achieves the title of trillionaire.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is on track to deliver revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 2.75. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $363 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Still, those days are a long way off, as Supermicro is scrambling to increase its production capacity to support sales of $25 billion.\nIf the company can keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. However, even the bulls concede that maintaining growth of that magnitude is unlikely to happen. What's more likely is that the growth rate tapers off to a more manageable 50%, in which case Supermicro could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nSome on Wall Street believe the demand for AI-capable servers will continue for years. Bank of America analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya calculates the market will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the next three years, maintaining that Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\nThis helps underscore the massive opportunity. If Supermicro captures just a small part of that windfall, the company will be a member of the $1 trillion club in short order.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Morgan Stanley's Highest Conviction Stocks: Top 20 Stocks To Buy.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Morgan Stanley's other high conviction stocks.\nWith the second half of 2024 having settled in, the broader economic environment that will determine the future course of the stock market is becoming clearer. While the surge in investor interest surrounding artificial intelligence stocks placed the macroeconomic picture in the background for a while, now, as the second quarter earnings season is nearly over, macroeconomics is coming back into play. Investors are eager to read the mind of Fed chairman Jerome Powell for future interest rate cut decisions and the crystal ball to see what way the economy is heading.\nOn this front, investment bank Morgan Stanley has been churning out quite a lot of reports to guide investors. One such report came out in July and shared the bank's key themes to focus on during the month. While July is over, this report contains key details that can provide information about what to expect for the rest of the year too. Two of the biggest takeaways from this report cover an economic soft landing and the potential for equities performance to widen.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nOn the former front, the bank shared that July \"bolstered the case for a soft landing as inflation has declined and a few major central banks cut rates.\" It believes that forward looking data suggests that \"wage growth should continue to slow in the U.S. and Eurozone\" which will eventually contribute to cooling inflation and eventually lower rates to increase the chances of a soft landing. In terms of data, the bank's estimates for 2025 suggest that year over year wage growth could sit at 3% in 2025 for a marked growth over the 2022 peak.\nBack then, wage growth percentages as indicated by Indeed postings and the Fed had stood at ~9.4% and ~6.5%, respectively. As an additional positive note, the bank also adds that the US is leading the EU and the UK because of its wage growth of 3% which is less than half of the UK's roughly 7%.\nOn the latter front, i.e., MS' belief that equities performance can widen, it shares that there \"is ample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery.\" What this means is that big tech has accounted for most of the market's returns this year due to the AI hype, and this can spread out to smaller firms but only if the broader economy recovers. Underlying this belief is data for the flagship S&P index's price to earnings ratio, as the bank shares that the 12 month forward P/E \"runs at 21x on a cap-weighted basis but only 16x equal- weighted.\" This suggests that the smaller companies have room to catch up with the larger companies, but their performance will only improve if consumer and business spending flourishes during a cyclical uptrend.\nThis potential has led the bank to lament that \"we turned neutral too soon\" as it also cites forward earnings data to support the hypothesis of the bifurcation in valuation. For the Magnificent Seven stocks, the 12 month forward earnings rebased to 100 as of December 2023 sit at a whopping 120 while the estimate for the remaining 493 firms on the S&P index is ~106. However, before you get too optimistic, MS also cautions against investing in small cap stocks. It shares that small cap \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates, which seems unlikely in the current inflation environment.\" Plotting the returns of small caps with bond yields to signify a relationship with interest rates, its data shows that when bond yields were at 1%, small cap relative returns to large caps were 100%. But when the yields soared to ~5.6%, these returns dropped to ~82%.\nMS' August report builds on the July themes. It builds on the bearishness surrounding small caps, shifts the focus on the labor market over inflation, and brings real estate into the mix. Reducing wage growth allows the Fed to shift its focus from inflation \"to potential cracks in the labor market,\" says the bank, but it cautions that recession \"indicators such as the Sahm Rule are creeping toward a recessionary threshold based on the rising national unemployment rate.\" Its data shows that the 3 month national unemployment average is 0.5% over the previous 12 month low, which rings a warning bell, to say the least. Still bearish on small caps, it adds that while \"recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.\"\nThere is some positivity in the August report, though. The bank shares that commercial real estate, which has been one of the hardest hit sectors from rising rates and shifting trends to remote working, now presents an \"emerging opportunity set.\" The analysts outline that commercial real estate valuations \"valuations have become more attractive in the face of higher interest rates and elevated supply,\" adding that they \"expect volumes to pick up this year due to upcoming debt maturities, reinforcing these lower entry points.\" Counterintuitively, this optimism is based on depressed valuations as it uses the commercial real estate cap rate. As per MS' data, this rate sat at 9% in March 2024, for nearly a two percentage point lead over retail real estate and a wider three point lead over residential real estate. The bank is also quite impressed with hedge fund performance in 2024 as it commented that the funds \"delivered attractive risk-adjusted performance in the first half of 2024 and their positioning suggests confidence in the opportunities for skill-based returns.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks, we used its latest 20 top conviction stock ideas and ranked them by the average percentage share price upside to the bank's own share price targets.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nShare Price Upside: 21%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's largest technology company in terms of revenue and market capitalization. Its $3.4 trillion valuation is driven by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s bread and butter product, the iPhone, its tight ecosystem that drives complementary and other product sales, and technological and design strengths that focus on aesthetics as well as hardcore engineering such as semiconductor design. For the nine months ending in June, $155 billion of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s $296 billion in revenue was from iPhone sales. This makes the iPhone upgrade cycle a key tenet of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis, as analysts and investors place their faith in strong product design and ecosystem capture making iPhone users stick with the lineup when they choose to upgrade. Another key pillar of the hypothesis is the Services business division which accounted for $72 billion of revenue during the nine month period. Apart from products such as the App Store, Services also include revenue from payments made by Google to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to offer Google's Search on its products, and anti trust action against Google or other legal actions could spell trouble.\nPolen Capital mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\"Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\"\nOverall AAPL ranks 8th on our list of Morgan Stanley's highest conviction stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It said on the call that ongoing talks with two traditional car makers in Japan would be finalised this year.\n\"Rub your eyes and wait,\" Wu said, without naming the companies.\nOn the full-year outlook for its smartphone business, Foxconn said it remained \"flattish\" due to a higher base in the first half of last year, adding that the outlook for the second half of this year is better than the corresponding period in 2023.\nThe company expected revenue for the third quarter to grow significantly from a year earlier, although revenue from smart consumer electronics including smartphones was likely to be flat.\nFormally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Foxconn has expected its operations to pick up gradually in the second half as many electronics vendors, including Apple, usually release new products ahead of the year-end holiday season.\nPrior to the earnings announcement, Taipei-based KGI Securities revised up its sales forecast for Foxconn this year, saying strong demand for new iPhones and AI servers could support a better-than-expected outlook in the second half.\nShares of Foxconn closed up 2.5% ahead of the results announcement.\n(Reporting By Yimou Lee and Faith Hung; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman, Kim Coghill and Bernadette Baum)\n"

        "Title": "Google antitrust ruling may pose $20 billion risk for Apple",
        "Author": "  Aditya Soni ",
        "Text": "By Aditya Soni\n(Reuters) - Apple's lucrative deal with Google could be under threat after a U.S. judge ruled that the Alphabet-owned search giant was operating an illegal monopoly.\nA potential remedy for Google to avoid antitrust actions could involve terminating the agreement, which makes its search engine a default on Apple devices, Wall Street analysts said on Tuesday.\nGoogle pays Apple $20 billion annually, or about 36% of what it earns from search advertising made through the Safari browser, for the privilege, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.\nIf the deal is undone, the iPhone maker could take a 4-6% hit to its profit, the analysts estimated.\nThe pact runs until at least September 2026 and Apple has the right to unilaterally extend it for another two years, according to media reports in May that cited a document filed by the Department of Justice in the antitrust case.\n\"The most likely outcome now is the judge rules Google must no longer pay for default placement or that companies like Apple must proactively prompt users to select their search engine rather than setting a default and allowing consumers to make changes in settings if they wish,\" Evercore ISI analysts said.\nApple's shares were trading flat on Tuesday, underperforming a recovery in the broader market after Monday's global selloff. Alphabet was little changed, after falling 4.5% in the previous session.\n\"The message here is that if you've got a dominant market position with a product, you'd better avoid the use of exclusive agreements and make sure any agreement you make gives the buyer free choice to substitute away,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania.\nTo be sure, the \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into 2026.\nAI TILT\nStill, if the tie-up is scrapped, Apple will have several options including offering customers alternatives such as Microsoft Bing to customers, or potentially a new search product powered by OpenAI.\nAnalysts agree that the ruling will speed up Apple's move towards AI-powered search services. It recently announced that it would bring OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot to its devices.\nIn a shift away from exclusive deals that would help Apple ward off regulatory scrutiny, the company has said it is also in talks with Google to add the Gemini chatbot and plans to add other AI models as well.\nApple is also revamping Siri with AI technology, giving it more control to handle tasks that had proven tricky in the past such as writing emails and interacting with messages.\nWhile those efforts are expected to make little money in the coming years, they could help capitalize on the new technology.\n\"Apple could see this as a temporary setback, especially since it earns a lot from the Google search deal, but it is also an opportunity for them to pivot to AI solutions for search,\" said Gadjo Sevilla, analyst at Emarketer.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Priyanka G in Bengaluru and Kenrick Cai in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett offered more details Wednesday about the stocks he has been selling lately, including confirming that he sold more than 389 million Apple shares during the second quarter.\nBerkshire Hathaway still owns 400 million shares of the iPhone maker, so it remains the biggest position in the conglomerate's stock portfolio, according to the company's latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The news that Buffett had unloaded a huge chunk of Apple came out in Berkshire's earnings report earlier this month, but the exact number of shares he sold wasn't clear until Wednesday.\nIn addition to the big Apple sale, Berkshire has also been trimming its investments in Bank of America, Chevron, Capital One, Floor & Decor Holdings, T-Mobile and Louisiana Pacific recently. Berkshire also unloaded its nearly $1 billion Snowflake investment.\nAs a result of all the selling, Berkshire's already massive cash pile has ballooned to the record level of $277 billion.\nBut Berkshire did sink more money into the insurer Chubb and oil producer Occidental Petroleum, while revealing smaller new investments in aerospace parts maker Heico Corp. and cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty.\nThe quarterly filings don't spell out which moves Buffett made and which actions were taken by one of the two other investment managers at Berkshire, but Buffett typically handles all the biggest investments worth more than $1 billion.\nAnd many investors watch Buffett's actions closely because he has such a remarkably successful track record over the decades.\nIn addition to the nearly $300 billion stock portfolio, Berkshire owns several major insurers, including Geico, one of the nation's largest railroads in BNSF, a collection of big utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies. Its holdings include well-known brands like Dairy Queen, Helzberg Diamonds and NetJets.\n"

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been tech archrivals for roughly 40 years, since the dawn of the personal computer.\nThe two companies have different routes to dominance of the tech industry. Microsoft has largely climbed the ladder through its ubiquitous Windows operating system, dominance of enterprise software, and, more recently, its strength in cloud infrastructure. Apple, meanwhile, has reached a market cap of $3 trillion, largely through the popularity of its consumer electronics devices such as the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and others.\nIn 2024, the two tech titans are set to butt heads again. Let's take a look at how each company is positioning itself as the next transformative technology, generative AI, takes hold.\nMicrosoft emerged as an early leader in artificial intelligence largely because of its partnership of OpenAI, the AI start-up behind ChatGPT. Microsoft has invested an estimated $13 billion in OpenAI, and that has enabled it to leverage OpenAI's technology across a wide range of products, including Azure OpenAi, its CoPilot AI assistant, and its GitHub code repository.\nMicrosoft is already gaining traction with AI-infused products in a way that few other companies are. For example, Microsoft now has 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year, and spend per customer continues to grow as well. Azure AI also seems to be a key reason it's gaining market share on Amazon Web Services, generally considered the leader in cloud infrastructure.\nAI is also contributing to products like Microsoft, its next-generation data platform, which has more than 14,000 paid customers.\nLooking ahead, Microsoft also has a broader reach than any of its tech rivals in the \"Magnificent Seven\" with AI and with an assistant like Copilot. That's because it can extend Copilot to a wide range of products, including Microsoft Office, other consumer-facing products like Linkedin, and the Github code repository. It also has more direct relationships with enterprise customers than its peers, giving it a ready market for AI tools.\nThus far, Microsoft has played its hand its well, and CEO Satya Nadella is clearly willing to do what it takes to make Microsoft an AI leader.\nApple has taken a much slower approach to AI than Microsoft, and for a long time Apple was criticized for a seeming lack of AI strategy. However, the tech giant flipped the script when it unveiled Apple Intelligence in June, showing off a suite of tech tools like writing assistants and image generation that will soon be embedded in iPhones and other Apple devices.\nWith that move, Apple's hammered home the underlying strength of its business, which is that it's much easier to deploy new technology or new software to consumers when you own the hardware, and one of its greatest competitive advantages is its installed base of more than 2 billion devices.\nIn other words, if you own an iPhone or another Apple device, you'll be likely to use Apple Intelligence because you'll be directly exposed to it and it will be free on your phone. In this sense, Apple has a much different business model, and arguably a better one, than any other tech giant in AI because it can use the technology to drive sales and higher prices of its iPhones, which are already overwhelmingly popular.\nApple Intelligence isn't widely available yet, and its next iteration of phones, the iPhone 16, will go on sale next month. Sales of those devices will be the best early indication of Apple's potential in AI.\nThese two companies could end up dominating AI, the way they have the last generation of technology from two different angles, but for now Microsoft seems to have the upper hand.\nIts partnership with OpenAI looks like a coup at this point as that $13 billion investment has paid off enormously in the company's surge in market cap and its head start over rivals. OpenAI also appears to be the technological leader in generative AI as it set the tone for the new era by launching ChatGPT.\nApple could emerge as a force as well with Apple Intelligence, but for now, Microsoft is the safer AI stock to own and the better of the two.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Spotify will update its app on Apple devices in the European Union on Wednesday to include prices of its various plans and services, more than three months after the iPhone maker rejected such a move.\nThat rejection was due to Spotify not accepting Apple's Music Streaming Services Entitlement, newly introduced terms governing how music streaming apps in the European Economic Area inform users of other ways to make purchases.\nThe Swedish audio streaming company said while it is now accepting those terms, its iOS app will not give users an external link to make purchases as it does not want to pay Apple a commission on such transactions.\nApple had said that accepting its music streaming terms did not require an external link for payments.\n\"While this is progress, it's only a small step in the long march towards giving iPhone consumers basic product experiences they expect and deserve in their apps,\" Spotify said in a statement.\nApple made it easier for music streaming apps to communicate with users on iOS devices in the EU in early April, a month after Brussels fined it 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.\nApple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza)\n"

        "Text": "While the current buzzword for the hottest tech stocks might be the \"Magnificent Seven,\" that could soon turn into the Terrific Three.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have put a considerable amount of daylight between themselves and the remainder of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.\nNvidia, Microsoft, and Apple all have market caps in the range of $3 trillion, and all are among the leaders in the AI revolution in different ways.\nNvidia is the leading chipmaker, building the AI infrastructure that is powering new large language models and applications like ChatGPT. More than any other company, Nvidia has defined the current AI era, and its stock has been the biggest gainer based on market cap.\nMicrosoft has established itself as a leader in AI applications thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft has invested an estimated $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker, and it has forged a close partnership with OpenAI, which has allowed it to deploy ChatGPT across a wide range of products, including Azure, its Office suite, GitHub, and Bing, and the AI-based Copilot, as well as other AI tools already driving meaningful growth for Microsoft.\nFinally, Apple has been somewhat late to the AI party, but the iPhone maker can't be ignored when it comes to a new technology like AI. That's because Apple has an installed base of active devices of 2.2 billion, meaning that it controls the connectivity to AI for billions of users. Apple is also releasing Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools like a writing assistant, which is expected to be available to consumers shortly.\nAs the descriptions show, all three of these companies have their own strengths in AI, and all three stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in the AI era. However, Nvidia has been the clear winner during that time, as the chart below shows.\nNvidia is also the most expensive stock of the three based on its trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which is currently 65, compared to Microsoft at 37 and Apple at 33.\nHowever, Nvidia is also the fastest-growing of the three stocks and is expected to grow revenue by 98% this year, compared to Microsoft at 16% and Apple at 8%.\nBecause of that, Nvidia' forward P/E is much lower, at just 40, bringing it more in line with that of Microsoft and Apple.\nOf the three stocks, Nvidia's future is the most closely tied to AI. Its revenue more than tripled over its last four quarters as it's become the de facto supplier of GPUs and other components needed for AI infrastructure.\nNvidia's also moving fast to release new products and stay on the cutting edge of AI and ahead of the competition. The company just announced a suite of services and computing platforms to help build the next generation of humanoid robots.\nAdditionally, the company recently launched its new Blackwell platform, which can process trillion-parameter large language models at as much as 25 times less cost and energy than Nvidia's previous Hopper architecture.\nNvidia has executed nearly perfectly since the beginning of the generative AI era, and the company looks like a good bet to continue to dominate the market for AI hardware.\nWhile Microsoft and Apple both have their own strengths in AI, they don't have the same level of exposure to AI that Nvidia does, and they haven't demonstrated the same ability to develop new AI technology.\nIf you're bullish on AI, Nvidia looks like the best stock of the three to own today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Willow Roberts ",
        "Text": "Apple held its third-quater earnings call this week, and it looks like things went pretty well overall. Total revenue was $85 billion, up around 5% year-over-year, and the Mac managed to go up 2% year-over-year as well, bringing in just over $7 billion. But a comment from the Q&A section of the call suggests that the company isn\u2019t expecting any bumps in Mac revenue for the rest of the year and, as MacRumors suggests, this could be code for \u201cno new MacBook.\u201d\nAfter being pressed for clarification on product revenue expectations for the September quarter, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri commented:\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going into other categories \u2026 Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging [quarter compared] from a year ago, given the fact that we launched, and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch.\u201d\nPut a little more simply, this means the Mac revenue for the later quarters of last year was particularly high because Apple had just launched the new MacBook Air M3 \u2014 and this year might look a little disappointing in comparison. It\u2019s possible that Maestri is making the point that Apple saw a larger bump in revenue from the 15-inch MacBook Air than it expects from the upcoming M4 MacBook Pro.\nOn the other hand, this comment could easily be interpreted that the M4 MacBook Pro has been pushed to 2025. This would be odd, especially since that would mean the iPad Pro would be the only M4 device released this year.\nHowever, it\u2019s clear in the call that the questioner was asking for more information than Maestri was willing to provide. Apple obviously doesn\u2019t want to simply leak its plans for the rest of the year, so although the comments imply there won\u2019t be a new MacBook Pro\u00a0this year, nothing is set in stone.\n"

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffet was born in 1930, and he bought his first stock at age 11. By 1965, he was running his very own investment company called Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), where he continues to cement his legacy as one of the world's greatest investors.\nBerkshire has become a conglomerate with several wholly owned companies under its umbrella, in addition to a portfolio of 47 publicly traded stocks and securities.\nBerkshire's largest holding is Apple, which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. Since then, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have also achieved that milestone.\nBerkshire could soon be the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join them. Its stock has delivered an incredible compound annual return of 19.8% since 1965, carrying the company to a valuation of $922 billion. Here's why it could surpass the $1 trillion milestone within the next year.\nBuffett is a value investor, which means he likes to buy great companies at an attractive price with the intention of holding on to them for the long term. Robust profitability, reliable growth, strong management teams, and shareholder-friendly programs like stock buybacks and dividend schemes are just some of the attributes he looks for when deciding to invest.\nTime is Buffett's greatest ally, because he relies on the magic of compounding to build his wealth for him. There is no better example than Berkshire's investment in Coca-Cola. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion acquiring shares of the beverage giant between 1988 and 1994, and it still holds all of them today. That position is now worth a whopping $27.5 billion.\nAside from the enormous capital gain, Berkshire received $736 million in dividend payments from Coca-Cola in 2023, and it's set to earn an even bigger amount this year!\nBerkshire's other long-term investments in American Express, Moody's Corp, and Apple (to name a few) are similar success stories.\nBerkshire Hathaway was originally a textiles company. It was on the cusp of failure before Buffett stepped in to buy it in 1965, but he quickly realized he couldn't rescue its legacy business, so he converted it into a holding company for his various investments.\nOver the years, Berkshire has acquired entire businesses like Duracell, GEICO Insurance, and Dairy Queen. In addition, the conglomerate's portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities is worth $302.4 billion. As I mentioned above, Apple is the largest holding in that portfolio.\nBerkshire spent around $38 billion accumulating Apple shares since 2016, and despite selling more than half of its position this year, its remaining holding is still worth over $86 billion.\nBank of America and American Express are Berkshire's second and third-largest holdings. It also holds sizable positions in energy companies Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, worth $17.8 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively.\nSome of Berkshire's smaller positions include Visa ($2.1 billion), Mastercard ($1.8 billion), and even Amazon ($1.6 billion). Berkshire first bought Amazon stock in 2019, and Buffett has expressed regret for not identifying the opportunity sooner. Even the world's best investors make mistakes!\nBerkshire stock surged by 4,384,748% between 1965 and 2023, which translated to a compound annual return of 19.8%. That crushed the 31,223% gain (10.2% compounded annually) in the S&P 500 over the same period.\nIn dollar terms, an investment of just $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth a whopping $43.8 million by the end of 2023. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $313,230. Berkshire continues to outperform the S&P 500, with a 19.1% gain this year versus just 12.7% for the index.\nBerkshire generated $183.5 billion in revenue during the first half of 2024 (ended June 30), representing a 3.1% increase from the year-ago period. Over $76.3 billion came from sales and services from the conglomerate's various business interests, and a further $43.4 billion came from insurance premiums. Its energy and utilities businesses also contributed $35.7 billion.\nBerkshire also reported $43.3 billion in net earnings during the first half, so the conglomerate is also very profitable.\nWhile Berkshire's top-line growth has been fairly modest in 2024 so far, investors should focus on its long-term record. The conglomerate delivered $49.3 million in revenue during 1965, and according to Wall Street's consensus estimate, that figure is on track to top $368.6 billion in 2024!\nBerkshire has a market cap of $922 billion as of this writing, so its stock only needs to gain a further 8.5% to push the conglomerate into the $1 trillion club. Given its 58-year track record of 19.8% annual growth \u2014 and its 19.1% gain in 2024 so far \u2014 it appears likely to happen within the next year. Mathematically speaking, it could cross the milestone within the next six months.\nWith that said, Berkshire is now sitting on a record $277 billion in cash thanks in part to its recent sales of Apple stock. Cash typically yields a lesser return than growth assets like stocks, so that could be a short-term headwind to reaching the $1 trillion club. On the plus side, it positions Berkshire perfectly to pounce on new opportunities that could fuel its long-term growth.\nFurthermore, Berkshire is on track to earn record dividends from its top holdings this year, as Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola have each increased their payouts so far. On top of that, the U.S. Federal Reserve could cut interest rates up to three times by the end of 2024, which will be a tailwind for Berkshire's consumer, transport, and logistics businesses, because they are sensitive to swings in economic growth.\nFinally, Buffett authorized the repurchased of $2.9 billion worth of Berkshire stock in the first half of 2024 as a way to return money to shareholders, which is a clear sign he still believes the conglomerate represents a good value. As my colleague Sean Williams points out, it takes Berkshire's total repurchases to almost $78 billion in just the last six years, which is more than Buffett has deployed into any other stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

Average share price is calculated as one class A share equals 1,500 class B shares.\nFirst, Berkshire's buyback plan has two main conditions that must be met before any share repurchases can take place.\nThe company cannot be left with less than $30 billion in cash and short-term investments after the buybacks occur. Berkshire has $277 billion on its balance sheet, and has had a 12-figure sum for a long time, so this has yet to be an obstacle.\nWarren Buffett must believe that Berkshire trades for less than its intrinsic value, using a conservative analysis. It used to require him and vice chairman Charlie Munger, who passed away last year, to agree.\nSo, to be perfectly clear, if Berkshire is buying back any stock at all, it means that Buffett thinks it's still cheap. With the exception of June, when no buybacks occurred whatsoever, Buffett clearly believed Berkshire was trading for less than the true value of the company.\nInterestingly, for much of June, Berkshire's stock price was lower than the average price it paid to buy back shares in May, and even in February, which was by far the most active month of the year for buybacks. But if Berkshire's other stock market moves, such as the massive Apple sale, are any indication, Buffett may be taking a more cautious approach to capital allocation for the time being.\nHowever, as of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway trades for about $444 per share, which is significantly higher than any price Buffett and his team have paid to buy back shares throughout its history. In other words, Berkshire has never traded at a price this high, other than in the past few weeks, so we won't know if Buffett thinks the current price is a good value until we see Berkshire's buyback activity, or lack thereof, for the third quarter.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Here's Why Apple (AAPL) is a Bullish Stock in a Tough August",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL have come a long way over the past three years to around $222 from $130 at the beginning of January 2021. However, the uptick in the Apple stock has been erratic at times. While the stock gains were 35% and 49% in 2021 and 2023, respectively, shares tanked 26% in 2022 when the company\u2019s product sales hit a roadblock due to the outburst of the pandemic.\nTherefore, investors may be rightfully skeptical about Apple\u2019s performance in the notoriously challenging month of August when several stocks post lackluster performances. However, Apple is experiencing a bullish trend this year, with its shares gaining 15.5% year to date.\nMoreover, Apple\u2019s short-term moving average (50-day) went above the long-term average (200-day) on Jun 13, and the tech behemoth\u2019s shares have advanced almost 4% since then. After all, this phenomenon is a golden cross in technical terms, which is considered a potential indicator of a long-term uptrend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAstute investors should have considered buying Apple stock during the bullish crossover period. However, it\u2019s not too late to place a bet on the iPhone maker. This is because the company has the wherewithal to go far in artificial intelligence (AI) and boost iPhone sales through planned discounts in China. Apple\u2019s stock is also trading at a reasonable price point compared to other tech bigwigs.\n\u00a0\nCompanies such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, to name a few, have gained substantially over the past year, banking on the spectacular growth in AI. However, Apple is slightly late in joining the AI bandwagon.\nBut this is Apple\u2019s trend, the company always gambles with new technology after doing proper research, which helps it to introduce market-leading products. The company didn\u2019t enter the smartphone and smartwatches market in the first place, yet it is now leading such markets.\nApple is introducing a generative AI platform where a series of new products, including language and image generation tools, are lined up. Apple\u2019s brand loyalty will certainly boost sales of such products, and with $162.34 billion in cash and marketable securities (as of Mar 30, 2024), Apple is further poised to invest more in AI.\n\u00a0\nRising trade tensions between the United States and China, coupled with stiff competition from Huawei, have impacted Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China for quite some time. However, Apple seems to have successfully lured Chinese customers in the fiscal third quarter with attractive iPhone discounts and improved iPad margin by refreshing its design.\nThis encouraging development will surely lift Apple\u2019s revenues in the fiscal third quarter. According to market intelligence firm IDC, Apple offered discounts of up to $317 on select iPhone products in China, which is expected to narrow down iPhone sales decline by 3.1% in the fiscal third quarter.\nApple is slated to report earnings for the Apr-Jun quarter on Aug 1, and an improvement in revenues is expected to boost the company\u2019s bottom line. Apple is projected to notch earnings per share of $1.34 for the fiscal third quarter, more than $1.26 a year ago, indicating an increase of 6.4%.\nMoreover, Apple has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 4.1%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has a good chance to exhibit solid earnings growth in the upcoming earnings release, leading to an uptick in share price.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBut it\u2019s just not all about the fiscal third-quarter results, Apple is expected to introduce its iPhone 16 with advanced AI features in September, which could very well propel the iPhone maker to a $4 trillion market capitalization.\n\u00a0\nApple\u2019s modest stock gains compared to its AI rivals like NVIDIA and Amazon so far this year have made it a bargain in a dull August when investors are frantically searching for a better value stock.\nBy looking at the Price/Earnings ratio, the Apple stock presently trades at 33.6X forward earnings. On the other hand, rivals NVIDIA and Amazon\u2019s forward earnings multiples are 43.5X and 40.7X, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThus, investors must pick Apple shares like there\u2019s no tomorrow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 0.5% over the past 60 days, while the company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.8%. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Warren Buffett surprises by slashing Berkshire Hathaway's longtime Apple stake in second quarter",
        "Author": "  JOSH FUNK ",
        "Text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Billionaire Warren Buffett slashed Berkshire Hathaway's massive Apple stake in a move that could prove unsettling for the broader stock market \u2014 both because the investor is so revered and because there had been little positive financial news lately.\nJust two years ago Buffett called the stock one of the four giants of his conglomerate's business alongside Berkshire insurance, utility and BNSF railroad businesses that it owns outright. That gave investors the impression that Buffett might hold onto Apple indefinitely as he has with the Coca-Cola and American Express shares he bought decades ago.\nHowever, he has trimmed the Apple stake over the past year and has recently also sold off some of his stock in Bank of America and Chinese EV maker BYD while doing very little buying.\nAs a result, Buffett is now sitting on nearly $277 billion in cash, up from what was already a record $189 billion just three months earlier.\n\u201cThis could could alarm the markets especially given the news from last week\u201d with weak tech earnings, a disappointing jobs report and uncertainty about the future of interest rates, Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said.\nBuffett has consistently lavished praise on Apple CEO Tim Cook, who attended Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha in May, and talked about the way consumers are feverishly devoted to their iPhones and don't like to switch. He did trim more than 10% of Berkshire's Apple stake in the first three months of this year when he sold off more than 116 million shares, but the sale disclosed Saturday was a much bigger move.\nWedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note that he thinks \u201cBuffett is a core believer in Apple and we do not view this as a smoke signal for bad news ahead.\u201d Apple remains the largest investment in Berkshire's portfolio by far \u2014 more than double its Bank of America stake.\nIves said he thinks the recent tech sell-off is only a temporary distraction from the industry's long-term boom.\nBerkshire didn\u2019t give an exact count of its Apple shares in Saturday\u2019s report, but it estimated the investment was worth $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter even though shares soared over the summer as high as $237.23. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s Apple stake was worth $135.4 billion.\nShanahan estimates that Berkshire still holds about 400 million Apple shares.\nStill, while CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she looks at the Apple sale more as responsible portfolio management because the tech giant had become such a large portion of Berkshire's holdings, it does look like Buffett may be preparing for a downturn.\n\u201cThis is a company girding itself for a weaker economic climate,\u201d Seifert said.\nBerkshire reported a small drop in its bottom-line earnings because of a drop in the paper value of its investments. The company said it earned $30.348 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That\u2019s down from $35.912 billion, or $24,775 per A share, a year ago.\nBuffett has long cautioned investors that it's better to look at Berkshire's operating earnings when judging its performance because those figures exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely from quarter to quarter.\nBy that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings grew more than 15% to $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, from $10.043 billion, or $6,928.40 per Class A share, a year ago. Geico led the improvement of Berkshire's businesses while many of its other companies that are more sensitive to the economy reported lackluster results.\nThe results easily topped the $6,530.25 earnings per share that four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.\nBerkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.\n"

        "Title": "Was Warren Buffett's Big Sale of Apple Stock a Bet on Kamala Harris Beating Donald Trump?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The big story with Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter update was that Warren Buffett slashed his company's stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). At the end of 2023, Berkshire owned more than 905 million shares of the iPhone maker worth over $174 billion. Today, it has 400 million shares of Apple worth roughly $90.7 billion.\nMany investors could still be scratching their heads about why Buffett sold so much of Berkshire's position in Apple. There's one theory we can safely put to rest, though. Was Buffett's big sale of Apple a bet on Kamala Harris beating Donald Trump? Nope.\nAt Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett talked about Berkshire's first-quarter sales of Apple stock. He hinted that taxes were part of the motivation behind selling. Speaking about paying taxes, the legendary investor said:\nIt doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it. And if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\nVice President Harris wants to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Did Buffett's sale of Apple stock reflect this proposal from the Harris campaign? Not at all.\nPresident Joe Biden didn't drop out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination until July 21, 2024, after the end of the second quarter. Also, Harris didn't announce her plan to increase corporate tax rates until August. Buffett had already completed his Q1 and Q2 sales of Apple before either development. Even the presidential debate that led to pressure on Biden to discontinue his pursuit of the 2024 nomination didn't happen until June 27, and Buffett had likely already done most of his Q2 selling of Apple stock by then.\nSure, Buffett's nickname is \"the Oracle of Omaha.\" Even his oracular powers, though, wouldn't be able to predict the wild turn of events we've seen over the last six weeks on the U.S. political front.\nHowever, it's possible that Buffett thought that Biden would beat Trump and was worried about rising taxes if that happened. Most polls were close between the two men during the first half of the year. Biden's proposed budget for fiscal year 2025 called for corporate tax rates to increase to 28% -- the same level as Harris later proposed.\nWhatever Buffett's views about the 2024 presidential race, he clearly anticipates that U.S. corporate tax rates will increase in the future. Why? He's an expert at analyzing financial statements, and the financial statements of the U.S. government don't look very good.\nThe U.S. hasn't had a budget surplus since 2001. Its deficit in fiscal year 2023 was $1.7 trillion. The national debt totals more than $35 trillion. Buffett probably looks at these numbers and knows that taxes -- including corporate taxes -- almost certainly will go up at some point.\nAnd yet I still think Buffett could regret selling so much of Berkshire's stake in Apple. The timing of his big sale might not have been the best.\nApple is on the cusp of launching its first generative AI functionality. Some Wall Street analysts believe this will ignite an iPhone upgrade supercycle as consumers trade in their old iPhones for new ones that support the genAI features. If they're right, Apple stock could deliver impressive gains over the next few years -- regardless of who wins the presidency this November.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 7, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETF featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, Apple Inc. AAPL and Micron Technology, Inc. MU.\nWall Street has suffered a setback over the past few trading sessions as a weakening labor market and contraction in manufacturing activity raised apprehensions about a looming recession. Also, the surging Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar caused a \u201ccarry trade\u201d and a market meltdown.\nThe S&P 500 slipped 3% on Monday and registered the largest percentage drop since Sep 13, 2022, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF also declined 2.9% in yesterday\u2019s trading session. The broader index, in reality, declined 6.1% over the past three trading days, its largest three-day percentage drop since June 14, 2022.\nOn the other hand, Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, closed at 38.57 on Monday, which is much above its long-term average of 20. However, astute investors shouldn\u2019t shun equities completely amid the market mayhem. Instead, they should place bets on fundamentally sound stocks to meet their short-term and long-term obligations. After all, this is a temporary blip, and the market is all set to bounce back.\nNotably, the S&P 500 historically has rebounded a month, three months, and one year later following three successive falls of 1% or more, which it did in the last three trading sessions, per Dow Jones Market Data.\nJanus Henderson Investors research shows that during presidential election years the S&P 500 has posted an average annual return of 9.9%\u00a0 (read more: 5 Growth Stocks to Buy for an Imposing Election Year Rally).\nMoreover, the service side of the economy is humming, and the Federal Reserve is widely expected to trim interest rates as early as fall, which bodes well for the stock market.\nImprovements in new orders helped the service side of the economy to expand in July. The ISM\u2019s non-manufacturing PMI increased to 51.4% in July from June\u2019s reading of 48.8%, the lowest since May 2020.\nThe PMI\u2019s reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, which could easily nullify recession anxieties. This is because the service sector accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell recently assured that the central bank will dial back on its aggressive monetary policy since monthly price pressures from year-ago levels have begun to subside and could decline further toward the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\nMost market participants expect a greater likelihood of a 50-basis-point (bps) reduction in interest rates in September instead of an earlier projection of a cut of 25 bps. Needless to say, interest rate cuts increase consumer outlays, reduce borrowing costs and boost economic growth (read more: Fed's September Rate Cut Bets Rise: NVDA, GOLD, PHM to Gain).\nSince activity in the service sector is growing despite Wall Street turbulence, things are looking good for tech behemoths such as Apple Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc. in the long run. Interest rate cuts are a good omen for such tech players as their cash inflows aren\u2019t hampered and can be utilized for research and development.\nSpectacular gowth in artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year has been a blessing in disguise for Micron Technology, while Apple too recently joined the AI bandwagon (read more: Here's Why Apple is a Bullish Stock in a Tough August).\nWhile Apple is expected to benefit from planned iPhone sales discounts in China, Micron Technology is expected to do well due to the revival in DRAM demand. Also, let\u2019s admit that these stocks were pretty pricey, but thanks to the dramatic fall in their prices recently, investors should essentially buy the stocks at a discount.\nShares of the iPhone maker slumped 4.8% and 4.1%, respectively, on Monday and in the last five trading sessions. However, AAPL\u2019s expected earnings growth for the current quarter and year is 8.2% and 8.3%, respectively.\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company presently has a Growth Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThe average short-term price target of AAPL by brokerage firms increased 6.4% from the company\u2019s last closing price of $219.86.\nShares of the provider of semiconductor memory solutions fell 2.5% and 16.2%, respectively, on Monday and over the past five trading sessions. However, MU\u2019s expected earnings growth for the current quarter and year is 200.9% and 126.1%, respectively.\nThe Zacks Rank #2 company currently has a Growth Score of A. The average short-term price target of MU by brokerage firms surged 77.2% from the company\u2019s last closing price of $92.70.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Google monopoly ruling could help Apple defense in antitrust case",
        "Author": "  Jody Godoy ",
        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) - Apple could be the winner after Alphabet's Google lost its fight with the U.S. antitrust enforcers earlier this week, with a ruling that supports the iPhone maker's defense in its own antitrust court battle with U.S. prosecutors, legal experts said.\nA federal judge mostly sided with state and federal antitrust enforcers in the blockbuster case on Monday that ruled Google's search business was an illegal monopoly, but threw out a claim by several U.S. states that one of Google's ad tools was designed to give the company an advantage over Microsoft's Bing.\nThat piece could help Apple's defense in its own anti-monopoly case, experts said.\nThe ruling underscored Supreme Court precedent that companies almost never have a \"duty to deal\" with their rivals, said Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.\n\"Any case, including Apple, in which a duty to deal is a major portion, is going to get a close look,\" he said.\nThe states had claimed Google thwarted competition by failing to offer key features for rivals' ads through Search Ads 360, a tool for managing marketing campaigns across multiple search engines.\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta agreed with Google that it was not required to spur competition by accommodating its rival.\n\"Their claim requires grappling with a host of questions that the court is ill-equipped to handle,\" the judge said.\nThat part of the ruling is good for defendants, said William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University Law School and former commissioner of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\"It also is a reminder that the case is hardly finished,\" he said, adding that the case and appeals could take years.\nTo be sure, Apple could ultimately lose billions of dollars because of the Google case if the judge bans the search juggernaut from paying the iPhone maker and others to be the default search engine on their devices.\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\nBut the Google ruling could give Apple a boost in its case where the Justice Department says it hampered the development of third-party apps and devices.\nThe company last week asked for the case to be dismissed, arguing that putting reasonable limitations on third-party developers' access to its technology did not amount to anti-competitive behavior, and that forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation.\nThe judge in Apple's case need not follow Mehta's ruling, though Apple may try to use it to persuade him.\nThe Justice Department will have to show Apple's interactions with developers were more like Google's payments to device makers, Hovenkamp said.\n\"In order to win, the government is going to have to point to some kind of agreement, because then the standard becomes more aggressive,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Title": "Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Apple Inc",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-08-05, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $170.81. It's currently trading at a price of $219.81. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -28.69%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.43\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.74%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n88.02\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n82.79\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n170.81\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $150.27. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -46.28%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM, Intel Corp. INTC, Apple Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Arm Holdings plc ARM.\nThe semiconductor industry has witnessed stupendous growth over the past four decades, with chips becoming an integral part of electronic devices like computers and smartphones, to name a few. An increase in acceptance of emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to fuel demand for semiconductors.\nManufacturing, healthcare, and retail sectors have already integrated digital technologies that require robust semiconductor solutions. Thus, the global semiconductor industry is likely to witness a CAGR of 14.9% from 2024 to 2032, hitting $2062.59 billion by 2032, per Fortune Business Insights.\nHowever, despite the positive trend, picking the top semiconductor stocks is challenging since their sales fluctuate incessantly. So, here is one chip stock to buy right away \u2014 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. \u2014 and one industry bigwig to shun \u2014 Intel Corp.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing expects healthy demand for its chips as more companies begin to implement AI features in smartphones. Apple Inc.\u2019s initiative to launch the iPhone 16 this fall should boost demand for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s chips. The new \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d system has already benefited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Apple is one of the biggest clients of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and accounts for around one-fourth of TSM\u2019s revenues.\nDemand for AI applications like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gemini and Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT has increased noticeably. But such applications require huge data, kept in data centers, which rely on graphic processing units (GPUs) that NVIDIA Corporation manufactures. And without TSM\u2019s manufacturing prowess, the GPUs can\u2019t be operative. So, in a way, the surging demand for AI applications would continue to boost Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s sales over the next several years and help its shares soar.\nNo doubt, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s earnings outlook for the current year remains promising, with the $6.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share up 11.4% from a year ago.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s shares have already outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF this year (+64.6% vs. +22.6%).\nIntel, regrettably, is losing its competitive edge over its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Intel is in a fix after failing to make much progress in its foundry business. AMD has progressed significantly in producing high-performance processing machinery. Intel\u2019s failure to take advantage of the ever-growing AI applications industry is alarming against the strong growth posted by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is currently the industry standard.\nOn the other hand, Arm Holdings plc is disrupting Intel\u2019s server, storage, and networking space. ARM\u2019s designs in the micro server segment have witnessed espousal by quite a lot of Intel\u2019s competitors. As a result, Intel\u2019s earnings outlook for the current year remains bleak, with the $0.38 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share down a massive 77.5% from a year ago.\nIntel\u2019s shares have underperformed SOXX year to date, down 57.4%. Notably, both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel are listed in SOXX.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, by the way, has generated profits more competently than Intel. This is because TSM has a return on equity (ROE) of 25.5%, while Intel\u2019s is around 4.4%. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is primarily considered very strong.\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a stable business model. Its dividend payout ratio sits at 31% of earnings, a low payout that indicates the company is reinvesting the bulk of its earnings in research and development, a must for growth. Whereas, Intel\u2019s dividend payout ratio is 109% of earnings, which is unsustainable.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s shares are less expensive than Intel\u2019s, which has given the integrated circuit foundry an edge over the world\u2019s largest semiconductor company. After all, buying INTC\u2019s shares will burn a larger hole in your wallet than the TSM stock.\nThis is because, per the Price/Earnings ratio, TSM stock presently trades at 26.5X forward earnings. However, INTC\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 56.6X.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, rightfully, is a better buy than Intel as it is well-positioned to make the most of the growth in AI, can generate profit consistently, and has a lower valuation.\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of TSM by almost 19% from the company\u2019s last closing price of $172.04. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is at $250.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired stakes in cosmetics store chain Ulta Beauty and aircraft parts maker Heico during the second quarter, when it also nearly halved its huge stake in Apple.\nBerkshire owned about 690,000 Ulta Beauty shares worth $266.3 million and 1.04 million Heico shares worth $185.4 million as of June 30, according to a Wednesday regulatory filing containing its U.S.-listed holdings as of that date.\nUlta Beauty shares soared 14% and Heico shares rose 3% in after-hours trading, reflecting a belief that the companies won Berkshire's and perhaps Buffett's stamp of approval.\nWednesday's filing did not say whether Buffett did the buying, though his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler normally oversee Berkshire's smaller stock investments.\nUlta Beauty did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nHeico Co-President Eric Mendelson said he was honored to have Berkshire invest, citing both companies' decentralized business models. Shares of Hollywood, Florida-based Heico are up 32% this year through Wednesday's close.\n\"I assume that Berkshire is bullish on the aerospace industry as we are,\" Mendelson said in a phone interview.\nWhile better known for owning Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Apple stock, Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has stakes in many consumer and retail businesses.\nIts business portfolio includes brands such as Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, Duracell and Fruit of the Loom, and about $2.5 billion of stock in grocery chain Kroger.\nUlta Beauty, based in Bolingbrook, Illinois, has about 1,395 stores in all 50 U.S. states.\nBerkshire is also familiar with the aerospace sector, having paid $32.1 billion in 2016 for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, still its largest purchase of an entire company.\nBuffett later admitted he overpaid for Precision, which struggled with falling air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets.\nSNOWFLAKE EXIT\nUlta Beauty and Heico were among Berkshire's few purchases in a quarter marked by a hasty retreat from stocks.\nBerkshire sold $77.2 billion of stocks during the period, including about 390 million shares of Apple, and bought just $1.6 billion.\nSales included a nearly $1 billion investment in cloud computing company Snowflake and Berkshire's remaining stake in media company Paramount Global.\nThe selling left Berkshire with $276.9 billion of cash and equivalents, up from $189 billion at the end of March.\nBuffett's company has not said if it has since sold more Apple, though Buffett said in May he expected the iPhone maker to remain Berkshire's biggest stock holding by year-end.\nBerkshire has sold more than $3.8 billion of stock in Bank of America, its second-largest stock holding, in the third quarter. It stopped selling at least temporarily after the bank's share price fell 12% from mid-July.\nDuring the second quarter, Berkshire also reduced its stakes in Capital One, Floor & Decor Holdings, Louisiana-Pacific and T-Mobile, and added to stakes in Chubb and Sirius XM.\nBuffett turns 94 on Aug. 30. He has run Berkshire since 1965.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jamie Freed)\n"

        "Title": "New Spindrift\u00ae Fuji Apple celebrates the unmatched taste of real apples - never from concentrate",
        "Author": "PR Newswire ",
        "Text": "NEWTON, Mass., Aug. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Spindrift Beverage Co. Inc., the first sparkling water brand to use not-from-concentrate juice, announced a new flavor just in time for fall, Spindrift\u00ae Fuji Apple, and the return of seasonal fan-favorite Cranberry Raspberry. True to the brand's ethos, each product is proudly made the hard way with real squeezed fruit.\nFounded on the belief that the best tastes come from nature, Spindrift is proudly made the hard way with real squeezed fruit. When Spindrift set out to create a new apple flavor, the team tasted 18 unique blends of apple juice before agreeing that Fuji Apple hit all the right notes: aromatic, floral, juicy, with the right amount of sweetness.\n\"At Spindrift, we believe taste is everything,\" said Bill Creelman, Founder and CEO. \"This is why using real squeezed fruit is crucial to our process. Fuji apple juice has the most incredible flavor, aroma, and complexity. To honor the fresh taste of the fruit in every batch, we developed a cold chain network that ensures the freshness you enjoy from the tree lasts all the way through the process until it ends up in your can.\"\nSpindrift\u00ae Fuji Apple, like all of Spindrift's products, is made with real squeezed fruit, not-from-concentrate, and has 0g added sugar. To capture the unique character in Fuji Apple, the team sourced a blend of apple varietals grown in US orchards to complement and balance the bright, ripe flavor of Fuji Apple.\n\"Most apple-flavored beverages in the market use apple juice from concentrate,\" said Jon Silverman, SVP of Innovation. \"With concentrates, you're boiling apples down to a sugary syrup so you can store them for months or years at a time, and in the process, losing the flavor and aroma. Our process for making Spindrift Fuji Apple honors the fruit. These apples are made into juice within weeks of being picked. The difference in taste is remarkable. Each sip is like the first bite of a really good apple: that juicy, crisp snap of sweetness. Fuji is such an enjoyable and refreshing flavor; this will be an everyday Spindrift you'll keep coming back to.\"\nSpindrift is also releasing Cranberry Raspberry out of the vault for fall. The flavor has returned in the past few seasons, but this year, it will be more widely available online and in retail nationwide. \"We're also excited to 'bring back CranRas' as our consumers say. This flavor is an enduring favorite, and we love that it's become a seasonal tradition. Consumers look forward to stocking up and sharing Cranberry Raspberry while hosting or gathering with loved ones at occasions that make the last few months of the year so special,\" said Silverman.\nSpindrift\u00ae Fuji Apple and Cranberry Raspberry will be available at the end of August in select retailers and on the company's website August 19th. Prices and availability may vary.

        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAI stocks have pulled back considerably over the past few weeks and analysts believe this is exactly the healthy correction long-term investors were looking for. According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.\n\u201cNow that positions have been unwound, there\u2019s an opportunity for traders to take positions,\u201d Sluymer reportedly said.\nMany others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC.\n\u201cIf you look at what we\u2019ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it\u2019s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it\u2019s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,\u201d Ives said.\nFor this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in the spotlight after the company revealed Pixel 9 phones which have an on-device artificial intelligent assistant Gemini Nano. However, the shares are under pressure amid reports the US Justice Department is considering breaking up Google. Jefferies said in a fresh note that the market is assigning zero value to Google\u2019s Cloud and Hardware divisions. Jeffries analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) smartphone and device market share remains minimal, making it tough to gain traction. However, they see generative AI as a potential equalizer. Jefferies maintained its Buy rating on Google, citing Gemini as the most personalized generative AI assistant on the market.\nJefferies also emphasized that Google and Meta Platforms (META) are well-positioned to capitalize on the consumer AI boom.\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Before that, the stock fell following earnings despite posting strong numbers. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% year over year driven by search and Cloud. At a forward P/E of 22, analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0continues to be one of the cheapest AI stocks in the market as its valuation remains depressed amid fears caused by an overreaction.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cUnsurprisingly the portfolio\u2019s best performers in the very short term reflect this pattern, having narrowed to those most obviously exposed to the AI story \u2013 TSMC and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). While the portfolio has owned semiconductor companies for years it remains diversified and is underweight the group from an active risk perspective, dragging on relative performance in the last six months. The portfolio is currently positioned to take advantage of the Value Latency we see in smaller sized companies, and the performance of the quarter has been more aligned with those factors.\nWhile this positioning is painful in the short-term, we see considerable embedded value in our portfolio. We also see considerable risks and uncertainties existing in the AI theme that are not reflected in the Value Latency on offer in many stocks that have surged.\nReturning to the AI story, today the portfolio has around 10% of capital invested across TSMC and Alphabet. Meantime, Alphabet has multiple value levers to \u00a0pull across AI-augmented search, YouTube (now the \u2018must-have\u2019 streaming platform for young people) and Google Cloud.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the most notable transitions in recent decades has been the ascent of technology purveyors among the world's most valuable companies. It was just two decades ago that industrial and energy stalwarts General Electric and ExxonMobil\u00a0topped the list in terms of market cap, valued at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just 20 years later, it's technology that dominates the list.\nLeading the way are three of the most recognizable tech companies in the world. Apple currently tops the list at $3.4 trillion. Microsoft and Nvidia are close behind, each valued of $3 trillion.\nWith a market cap of just $1.3 trillion, it might seem premature to suggest that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is on track to join the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 163% over the past year and 495% over the past five years (as of this writing), driven by strong operating results that should continue.\nMeta has several distinct advantages, and its ever-expanding social media empire, market dominance, and strategic adoption of AI could drive its membership in this elite fraternity.\nWhile Meta Platforms was punished during the economic downturn, the stock has come roaring back, propelled higher by impressive financial results. In the second quarter, revenue of $39 billion climbed 22% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 jumped 73%.\nThe financial results were driven by solid user metrics. The number of people who paid daily visits one of Meta's family of social media sites -- which includes Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp -- grew to 3.27 billion, up 7% year over year.\nHelping fuel the robust results was the ongoing rebound in online marketing, which is improving thanks to gains in the overall economy. Meta's social media ecosystem plays host to the company's digital advertising.\nThe online ad arena is dominated by the industry's two leading players. In 2023, Alphabet's Google controlled an estimated 39% of the worldwide digital ad revenue, followed by Meta with 18%, according to data compiled by business intelligence platform Statista.\nAs the world's second-largest digital advertiser, Meta Platforms is well positioned to reap the benefits of the rebound, which could be substantial.\nWorldwide ad spending is expected to rise by 8% to more than $1 trillion in 2024, according to ad industry researcher WARC Media. Social media is expected to be the fastest-growing medium in digital advertising, capturing nearly 22% of total ad spending, according to the report. It goes on to say that Meta is \"on course to record oversized gains in the coming months.\"\nBeyond advertising, however, is Meta's strategy to profit from the windfall of artificial intelligence (AI). The company has leveraged the data it captures from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its own state-of-the-art large language models, which forms the foundation of generative AI.\nThe result is Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI), which feeds its flagship Meta AI chatbot. Earlier this year, the company unveiled Llama 3, declaring Meta AI as \"one of the world's leading AI assistants.\" The company made this system free to individual users (collecting even more data) while it charges the largest cloud infrastructure providers for the privilege of including it in their offerings.\nWhile there's a great deal of emphasis on AI, it isn't the only growth driver that could push Meta higher. Meta's Reality Labs -- home of its Oculus virtual reality (VR) business, Quest VR headsets, and its ever-changing metaverse blueprint -- has had little to show for its efforts thus far. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is convinced these investments will bear fruit, ultimately boosting Meta's profits.\nGiven the rebounding ad market, multiple growth drivers, and the tailwinds driving generative AI, it shouldn't take long for Meta Platforms to earn its membership in the $3 trillion club.\nMeta currently boasts a market cap of roughly $1.35 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 123% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Meta is expected to generate revenue of $161.6 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Meta would have to grow its revenue to roughly $360 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Meta of 14% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2031. It's worth noting that Meta has grown its annual revenue by nearly 1,000% over the past decade, so those expectations could well be conservative.\nFurthermore, at 27 times earnings, Meta is selling for a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500. That's an attractive price to pay for a company with a dominant market share, strong momentum, and multiple ways to win.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Vardah Gill ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks that Pay Dividends Monthly.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) stands against the other stocks that pay dividends monthly.\nOver the years, dividend stocks have consistently demonstrated resilience in challenging market conditions. While the recent focus on AI might suggest otherwise, the long-term attractiveness of these stocks has increased. Income investors have taken note of this trend, which is reflected in the growing role of dividends as a portion of personal income. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the share of dividend income has risen from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024, highlighting dividends as a significant source of income. The report also mentioned that since 1936, dividends have contributed to over one-third of the broader market's total equity returns, with the remaining two-thirds coming from capital appreciation.\nThis highlights how dividends have become increasingly important over the years. When considering inflation, dividends have outpaced it, suggesting that investors should focus on these stocks. A report by Wisdom Tree noted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends grew by an average of 5.7% annually, which is more than 2% higher than the inflation rate. The report also pointed out that in the last 64 years, dividends only declined in six years, and only once by more than 5%. In contrast, stock prices fell in 18 of those years, with the worst annual decline exceeding 40% and an average drop of over 11%. Stock prices were more than twice as volatile as the dividend cash flows, as short-term prices are more influenced by market sentiment, while long-term value is driven by cash flow stability.\nAlso read:\n10 Highest Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks\nWhen investing in dividend stocks, receiving payments more often is definitely a plus. Although most dividend stocks distribute payments to shareholders on a quarterly basis, there are a few hundred publicly traded companies that opt to pay dividends monthly instead. However, monthly dividend stocks have their downsides. While they offer appealing investment opportunities, their high yields can be misleading, often accompanied by multiple dividend cuts. The high yields are primarily due to the nature of the companies that opt for monthly payments, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), closed-end funds, business development companies (BDCs), and royalty trusts, which are common among monthly dividend payers. That said, many monthly dividend companies have not only kept up their payouts over the years but have also increased them, all while maintaining high yields.\nOnce the risks associated with high yields are addressed, investors can concentrate on the benefits of compounding. Monthly dividend stocks provide cash to investors more frequently than other stocks, allowing them to reinvest it sooner and take advantage of faster compounding. Since 1960, 85% of the cumulative total return of the broader market Index can be traced back to reinvested dividends and the effects of compounding, as reported by Hartford Funds. With this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that offer monthly payouts.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this list, we reviewed a list of companies providing monthly dividends to their shareholders. Among these, we specifically chose businesses with robust dividend practices, consistently maintaining their payouts across multiple years. The majority of these selected companies operate within the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, as they are required to allocate 90% of their income towards dividends. From that list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database of 912 hedge funds and their holdings.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nLong exposure of a busy city skyline featuring tall roof tops of different hotel brands.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 19\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) is a Virginia-based real estate investment trust company that operates in hotel properties across the US. The company's portfolio includes 224 hotels with over 30,000 guest rooms, spread across 87 markets in 37 states and the District of Columbia. The portfolio is concentrated on leading industry brands, featuring 100 Marriott-branded hotels, 119 Hilton-branded hotels, and five Hyatt-branded hotels.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE)'s business fundamentals remained robust, supported by a slower rate of new supply growth compared to historical levels. Its comparable hotel occupancy reached 80%, which is more than a 2% increase from the same quarter in 2023. While the greatest potential for continued growth is expected from the ongoing improvement in midweek business travel demand, the company also achieved higher occupancy rates on both weekdays and weekends during the quarter. This reflects the resilience of leisure travel demand and the benefits being realized as business travel patterns return to normal. Comparable hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) for the second quarter rose by 2.5% compared to the previous year, accompanied by a slight increase in average daily rate (ADR).\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE), one of the best dividend stocks, has been making uninterrupted dividend payments to shareholders since 2008. The company offers a monthly dividend of $0.08 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.73%, as of August 29.\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) was a popular buy among elite funds during Q2 2024, with hedge fund positions growing to 19, from 13 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's database. These stakes have a total value of more than $116.5 million. With over 2.6 million shares, Balyasny Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q2.\nOverall APLE ranks 6th on our list of the stocks that pay dividends monthly. While we acknowledge the potential APLE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APLE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are on top of the world nowadays. They are the two most valuable stocks on the market, looking back at market-beating returns in the past five years. Apple's total returns delivered a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 36% in that period. Nvidia soared even higher with a 100% five-year CAGR. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been mighty kind to Nvidia's investors.\nThey achieved these massive gains in a strong era for the general market, but the S&P 500 index looks downright sleepy by comparison:\nIt would be cool if Nvidia and Apple were poised to continue their market-beating ways from here.

Unfortunately, I'm afraid that both stocks are a bit overvalued at today's massive market caps \u2014 $3.1 trillion for Nvidia and $3.4 trillion for Apple. I know it's like comparing mountains of cash to rivers of revenues, but these two market caps add up to about 23% of America's gross domestic product.\nI think that's too much. Apple and Nvidia may be overdue for a painful correction. At best, I don't expect them to rise much higher in the foreseeable future.\nAt the same time, good old International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) is gaining ground in the AI space, and its stock is undervalued today. I don't expect IBM's stock to pass the trillion-dollar mark in the next five years, but it should most certainly rise as Big Blue's enterprise-class AI tools add value to the stock. Most investors don't see this traditional computing giant as a promising AI investment yet. That's a big mistake.\nIBM's valuation ratios don't look terribly exciting at first glance. The stock is changing hands at 22 times trailing earnings and 2.9 times sales. Those are perfectly acceptable middle-of-the-road values for mature companies, just below the averages seen in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average market indices.\nThen your eye slides over to IBM's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio, and the stock suddenly looks different. When you calculate IBM's values based on its massive cash profit, the stock seems to belong in Wall Street's bargain bin instead. This ratio stops at 14 times free cash flows, just over half of the S&P 500's or Dow Jones' readings.\nCash is king, and IBM has plenty of it. The company's rich cash profits and relatively modest bottom-line earnings show that Big Blue's accountants are very good at lowering taxable profits while putting lots of real greenbacks in the bank. I see cash flow as a higher-quality measure of profitability, so it's easy to look away from IBM's moderate price-to-earnings ratio.\nRemember the five-year chart I showed you? IBM's chart for the same period is a different animal:\nThe stock has underperformed broad market indices for many years as it transformed a hardware-heavy business model into a more profitable software and services plan. In particular, you should know that the revamped Big Blue comes with a heavy focus on cloud computing, data security, and AI tools.\nYes, this company was a leading AI researcher long before ChatGPT's release opened the floodgates for AI investments. Many investors seem to have missed that connection since IBM's business results didn't immediately skyrocket in this soaring AI era. The big AI contracts are coming, just a bit late.\nYou see, IBM is happy to leave consumer-friendly ideas such as ChatGPT-style chatbots to other tech providers. This company will always go after large corporate contracts instead, adding extra layers of security, business-friendly data analytics, and lawsuit-repellant data tracking to the mix. Potential clients may take several quarters to test and approve the resulting AI recipe, but the end result is a lucrative long-term deal that won't be easy to replace.\nThe approvals are rolling in now, building a robust revenue stream for the long run. Market makers are still not paying attention, so IBM's stock keeps trading at incredibly low cash flow ratios. I can't wait to see what happens in a couple of years, when the AI contracts have become generous and highly profitable revenue streams.\nI'll admit that Nvidia and Apple are making solid cash profits, too. However, their sky-high stock prices already account for these high-quality profits. Apple's P/FCF ratio stands at 33 today, and Nvidia's is soaring at 79 times free cash flows.\nThanks, but no thanks. I'd much rather buy IBM's undervalued stock instead.\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Joey Pizzolato ",
        "Text": "This story has been updated with analyst comments and additional information from the company's earnings. \nPrepaid card firm and bank holding company Green Dot renewed its largest banking-as-a-service partnership in the second quarter despite regulatory pressure from the Federal Reserve.\nAustin, Texas-based Green Dot was able to secure a multi-year renewal with tech giant Apple's Apple Cash digital wallet, its largest BaaS partner by revenue, with \"improved financial terms,\" CEO George Gresham said on the company's second-quarter earnings call Thursday.\nThe renewal spells good news for Green Dot, especially in light of its $44 million settlement with the Federal Reserve in July, said Tim Switzer, vice president of equity research at Keefe, Buyette, and Woods (KBW).\n\"A main highlight this quarter\u2026 is they announced their renewal of their agreement with Apple, with Apple being their largest [BaaS] partner by revenue,\" Switzer said. \"The renewal of your biggest partner right after receiving a consent order I think is a positive, because it indicates that their partners are still confident that Green Dot will still be able sufficiently provide the services they want.\"\nGreen Dot's topline earnings per share missed analyst expectations, while revenue beat. Earnings per share came in at a 54-cent-per-share GAAP loss for the three months ended June 30. Wall Street analysts expected a 2-cent-per-share GAAP loss. Revenue was $407.1 million, an 11% year-over-year increase and 5.5% more than Wall Street's $382.5 million average revenue estimate. For net income, the company posted a $28.7 million loss, 27.7% below analyst estimates.\nIn addition to Apple, the company also provides BaaS services for Amazon Flex, Intuit Quickbooks and human resources software and services provider Dayforce, according to a February investor presentation.\n\"[Apple has] been the primary driver of growth in [Green Dot's] BaaS division,\" Switzer said, noting that the partnership accounts for 44% of Green Dot's total revenue. B2B Services revenue, which includes the bank's BaaS offering and its pay card business, came in at $252.1 million, an increase of 39.5% year over year, according to the company's earnings supplement.\nBy another measure, BaaS revenue landed at $231 million, up 44% year over year, and pay card revenue hit $21 million, up 4% over the second quarter of last year.\nNotably, KBW's Switzer said Q2 marked the first time \"in several quarters\" that Green Dot grew BaaS revenue on a year-over-year -basis without accounting for revenue from the Apple deal.\nThe company also signed \"a large merchant processor and an auto lender in our BaaS Group, and are expecting to launch these new partners in early 2025,\" Green Dot's Greshman said.\nMeanwhile, Green Dot's consumer segment, which includes its retail prepaid card business and digital bank offering, tallied a 25.1% decline in revenue to $96.7 million compared to last year's second quarter, according to the earnings supplement. Its retail prepaid card business logged a 31% decline to $60 million from last year's quarter, according to the earnings presentation.\nThe second quarter marks the fifth sequential quarterly decline in retail revenue for Green Dot, according to a research note from William Blair.\n\"After years of focusing on improving internal operations and the technology stack, we believe Green Dot is pivoting its focus to growth, but turning around the Retail division \u2013 23% of 2023 revenue, [down] 33% in the first half \u2013 could prove challenging,\" according to the note.\nDeclines in retail revenue were \"driven largely by secular headwinds and the deconversion of a retail program that created headwinds for both 1Q and 2Q24,\" according to the earnings presentation. Active retail accounts declined by 28% year over year to 1.23 million.\nGreen Dot reported total banking assets of $5.5 billion, up almost 15% from the beginning of the year, according to the earnings supplement.\nThe company tweaked its outlook for the full year, now expecting adjusted earnings at the low end of its guidance range of $1.45 to $1.59 a share.\nShares of Green Dot were trading up 13.6%, or $1.20, to $10.05 today at market close in New York following the company's earnings call Thursday. Green Dot has a market capitalization of $527.3 million.\n"

Shares of Hollywood, Florida-based Heico are up 32% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close.\n\u201cI assume that Berkshire is bullish on the aerospace industry as we are,\u201d Mendelson said in a phone interview.\nWhile better known for owning Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Apple stock, Buffett\u2019s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has stakes in many consumer and retail businesses.\nIts business portfolio includes brands such as Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, Duracell and Fruit of the Loom and about $2.5 billion of stock in grocery chain Kroger.\nUlta Beauty, based in Bolingbrook, Illinois, has about 1,395 stores in all 50 US states.\nBerkshire is also familiar with the aerospace sector, having paid $32.1 billion in 2016 for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, still its largest purchase of an entire company.\nBuffett later admitted he overpaid for Precision, which struggled with falling air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets.\nUlta Beauty and Heico were among Berkshire\u2019s few purchases in a quarter marked by a retreat from stocks.\nBerkshire sold $77.2 billion of stocks during the period, including about 390 million shares of Apple, and bought just $1.6 billion.\nSales included a nearly $1 billion investment in cloud computing company Snowflake and Berkshire\u2019s remaining stake in media company Paramount Global.\nThe selling left Berkshire with $276.9 billion of cash and equivalents, up from $189 billion at the end of March.\nBuffett\u2019s company has not said if it has since sold more Apple, though Buffett said in May he expected the iPhone maker to remain Berkshire\u2019s biggest stock holding by year-end.\nBerkshire has sold more than $3.8 billion of stock in Bank of America, its second-largest stock holding, in the third quarter. It stopped selling at least temporarily after the bank\u2019s share price fell 12% from mid-July.\nDuring the second quarter, Berkshire also reduced its stakes in Capital One, Floor & Decor Holdings, Louisiana-Pacific and T-Mobile, and added to stakes in Chubb and Sirius XM.\nBuffett turns 94 on August 30. He has run Berkshire since 1965.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett's investing style is not congruent with rapid buying and selling. Rather, the Oracle of Omaha built his fortune at Berkshire Hathaway by investing in quality companies and holding on to his high-conviction positions for decades.\nEach quarter, institutional investors are required to disclose their stock positions in a filing called a form 13F. Berkshire's most recent 13F did have quite a bit of change. Notably, Berkshire sold nearly half of its position in Apple \u2014 a cornerstone of the portfolio for many years. Subsequently, the investment firm scooped up nearly 700,000 shares in cosmetics company Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA).\nLet's dig into why Buffett might like Ulta, and assess whether your portfolio could also use a makeover featuring this leading beauty retailer.\nUlta is a beauty retailer with nearly 1,400 locations. Its stores can often be found in shopping centers or strip malls, as well as \"shop-in-shops\" at Target.\nOne of the things that makes Ulta so unique is its wide product selection. The company boasts nearly 25,000 different beauty products from 600 different brands. This level of optionality makes Ulta appealing to a broad base of customers across different price demographics.\nWarren Buffett's portfolio is heavily invested in financial services functions such as banks or insurance companies.\nHowever, another theme that Berkshire enjoys is investing in top-notch brands. When it comes to Ulta, the company has an extremely unique market position, which I think helps fuel its ability to build a brand moat. It doesn't have a ton of competition. Its primary competitor is Sephora, a subsidiary of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy.\nTo me, owning Ulta stock is far more attractive than buying into LVMH because it provides direct exposure to the cosmetics industry. On the other hand, LVMH is essentially a gigantic luxury operation that only provides tangential exposure to several different end markets.\nOn the surface, investing in a beauty retailer may not look like the most savvy idea at the moment. The macroeconomy has been plagued by a number of factors over the last couple of years. In particular, stubbornly high inflation has dramatically reduced purchasing power for the average consumer.\nThese trends have affected retailers across the board. For Ulta, the company's same-store sales have been decelerating for a while now. Unsurprisingly, investors appear to have soured on Ulta stock \u2014 sending shares down 22% so far in 2024.While this can look alarming on the surface, it's really only a small part of the entire puzzle.\nAnother characteristic of Buffett's investing style is to embrace being a contrarian. While Ulta may look like a falling knife, contrarian investors see an opportunity.\nThe charts above illustrate a really interesting valuation dynamic. Despite inconsistent sales trends over the last couple of years, Ulta's earnings per share (EPS) has grown significantly \u2014 suggesting strong unit economics overall. Yet despite these profit levels, Ulta's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has basically dropped off a cliff over the same time frame.\nIn other words, Ulta was trading at a higher valuation when it was generating lower levels of profit. It's this paradigm that I think attracted Buffett the most and inspired his position in Ulta. I think Buffett sees Ulta as a bit of a value opportunity.\nThe economy will eventually begin to show more significant signs of improvement over time. When this occurs, I suspect opportunities in the retail space will enjoy newfound gains. To me, this scenario is exactly what Buffett is forecasting for Ulta.\nI think investors with a long-term horizon should buy Ulta stock hand over fist right now. The stock looks dirt cheap and poised for a nice bounce-back once the macroeconomic picture begins to show signs of broader improvement.\nBefore you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ulta Beauty wasn\u2019t one of them.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cWearable Devices\u201d) (Nasdaq: WLDS, WLDSW), a technology growth company specializing in artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\")-powered touchless sensing wearables, announces the latest upgrade to the Mudra Band \u2014 enhanced gesture control functionality for the Apple Watch.\nThis new feature enhances convenience by enabling quick, hands-free control for common tasks, and significantly improves accessibility for older Apple Watch models which do not support some of the Apple Watch double tap gesture.\nThe Mudra Band's watch gesture control features will significantly enhance the value and functionality of the Apple Watch, particularly in terms of accessibility and convenience. It allows users to operate the watch using simple gestures of the same hand, even when their fingers hold something or temporarily can't touch the screen. By enabling users to control their watch without touching the screen, the Mudra Band simplifies interaction and reduces physical effort, empowering on-the-go and multi-tasking watch operation without the need to pause, stare at the screen, and use the other hand to operate it.\nTo watch a demo video, please visit: https://youtu.be/2C0Btga5GoI\nUsers can navigate the interface using familiar gestures. Simply pinching the index with the thumb and quickly flicking the wrist is used for navigation, and tapping or double-tapping is used to select an element or go back. The comfortable gestures are possible due to the Mudra Band\u2019s fingertip pressure measurement, which allows for more relaxed and subtle finger movements, rather than using abrupt jab gestures.\nThis advanced gesture control provided by Mudra Band allows users to pause music, stop timers, and answer calls without touching the screen. The Mudra Band significantly improves the usability of the Apple Watch for a broader audience, ensuring accessibility and convenience for all users.\n\u201cOne of our initial goals with the Mudra Band has been to provide our users with a same-hand touchless watch operation, and we are pleased to cater to multiple requests by our customers,\u201d says Asher Dahan, CEO of Wearable Devices. \u201cThis is a step forward in AI-based wearable technology, pushing the boundaries of what wearable technology can offer. The Mudra Band\u2019s new watch gesture control functionality is a testament to our commitment to innovation and user empowerment.\u201d\nThe new Apple Watch gesture control functionality for the Mudra Band will be available in the coming Mudra Band app update.\nAbout Wearable Devices Ltd.\nWearable Devices Ltd. is a growth company developing AI-based neural input interface technology for the B2C and B2B markets. The Company\u2019s flagship product, the Mudra Band for Apple Watch, integrates innovative AI-based technology and algorithms into a functional, stylish wristband that utilizes proprietary sensors to identify subtle finger and wrist movements allowing the user to \u201ctouchlessly\u201d interact with connected devices.

        "Author": "  Future Market Insights Global and Consulting Pvt. Ltd. ",
        "Text": "Germany is set to become a key supplier of apple cider vinegar in Europe, with an anticipated sales growth rate of 4.3% CAGR from 2024 to 2034. The rising use of cider vinegar in food preparation, along with increasing demand for organic and plant-based foods, is driving this growth. The trend is echoed across Europe, particularly in the UK and France, where healthier products with functional benefits are in high demand.\nNEWARK, Del, Aug. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global apple cider vinegar market value in 2019 was USD 516.8 million and it thrived at a CAGR of 4.9% in the following five years. In 2024, the net worth of this market is estimated to be almost USD 684.5 billion.\nThe global sales of apple cider vinegar are expected to rise at a rate of 5.7% per year between 2024 and 2034. The global apple cider vinegar industry value is predicted to reach USD 1,074.7 million at the end of this forecast period.\nSales are expected to grow since apple cider vinegar is widely regarded as the most efficient weight-loss treatment and is a staple of many diet regimens. As consumer interest in wellness continues to develop, more health-related firms are employing ACV powder to make tablets and sweets and are influencing the market positively.\nKey Takeaways from the Apple Cider Vinegar Market Study Report\nThe United States apple cider vinegar market is anticipated to register a CAGR of 3.2% during the projected years.\nGermany is likely to witness a 4.3% CAGR in the production and supply of apple cider vinegar over the next ten years.\nChina is the leading producer of apple cider vinegar in Asia which is expected to follow 3.8% CAGR during the forecast years.\nThe Apple cider vinegar industry of Japan is likely to witness a higher growth rate of 5.5% between 2024 and 2034.\nIndia is anticipated to present the most lucrative opportunities for apple cider vinegar suppliers with an estimated CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2034.\nCompetitive Landscape for the Apple Cider Vinegar Market Players\nThe overall market is highly fragmented due to the presence of several companies in the apple-producing temperate regions of the world. Prominent firms, such as Barnes Naturals, Carl K\u00fchne, PepsiCo, and others have extensively introduced a variety of free-from kinds of apple cider vinegar to support the growth of the potential market.\n\u201cApple vinegar producers that hold a significant share of the market are always striving to create products that are both practical for consumers purchasing home things and functional. In addition to liquid apple cider vinegar, these top manufacturers also offer tablets and gummies which have a longer shelf life and a greater market value.\u201d \u2013\u00a0says\u00a0Nandini Roy Choudhury, Client Partner at Future Market Insights.\nRecent Developments by the Apple Cider Vinegar Industry Participants\nIn March 2024, Apeal World, the sparkling apple cider vinegar brand, launched the third flavor option in organic lemon and mint. Sparkling water, organic apple cider extracts, and sustainably sourced spices are all combined to create these new apple cider vinegar flavors of lemon and mint. The firm has already introduced its clove, cinnamon, and vanilla RTD after ginger-flavored apple cider vinegar earlier.\nIn June 2023, Pureboost introduced its apple cider vinegar product as an antioxidant clean energy drink that is now the best-selling item on Amazon. This product is in the company's Superfoods Clean Energy segment and comes in a convenient portable pack. It is devoid of sugar and sucralose, much like all of their functional drink products.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) both posted their latest earnings reports on Aug. 1. Amazon's stock dipped after it missed analysts' revenue estimates and provided soft guidance for the current quarter, but Apple's stock held steady after it followed up its earnings beat with a stable near-term outlook.\nShould investors buy Apple and avoid Amazon? Let's take a fresh look at both companies' near-term challenges and valuations to find out.\nAmazon's revenue rose 10% year over year to $148 billion in the second quarter of 2024 but missed analysts' expectations by $760 million. That revenue miss was caused by the slowing growth of its North American and international retail segments, which offset the accelerating growth of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.\nGrowth by Segment (YOY)\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nNorth America revenue\n11%\n11%\n13%\n12%\n9%\nInternational revenue\n10%\n16%\n17%\n10%\n7%\nAWS revenue\n12%\n12%\n13%\n17%\n19%\nTotal revenue\n11%\n13%\n14%\n13%\n10%\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year over year.\nAmazon blamed its retail slowdown on tougher macro headwinds for consumer spending and lower average selling prices for bargain-hunting shoppers. It also said recent events -- including the U.S. presidential election, the attempted assassination of former President Trump, and the Paris Olympics -- were distracting shoppers and disrupting their online purchases.\nTougher competition from aggressive cross-border e-commerce competitors like Shein and PDD's Temu could be another major issue. All those challenges also throttled the growth of the company's integrated advertising services.\nOn the bright side, AWS' accelerating growth indicates the world's largest cloud platform continues to flourish -- even as it faces intense competition from Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's\u00a0Google Cloud. During the conference call, CEO Andy Jassy attributed a lot of that growth to the \"generative AI [artificial intelligence] boom,\" which is driving more companies to upgrade their cloud infrastructure services. AWS also has much higher operating margins than Amazon's e-commerce marketplaces, so it can still subsidize the expansion of its lower-margin businesses.\nAmazon expects its revenue to rise 8% to 11% year over year in the third quarter, but that midpoint missed analysts' estimates for 11% growth. For now, analysts expect the company's revenue and earnings to grow 11% and 58%, respectively, for the full year.\nApple's revenue rose 5% year over year to $85.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 29) and exceeded analysts' estimates by $1.4 billion. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, the company generated 52% of its revenue from the iPhone, 24% of its revenue from services (including its App Store and subscription-based platforms), and the remaining 24% from its Macs, iPads, and wearables, home, and accessories segments.\nGrowth by Segment (YOY)\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\niPhone revenue\n(2%)\n3%\n6%\n(10%)\n(1%)\nServices revenue\n8%\n16%\n11%\n14%\n14%\nMac revenue\n(7%)\n(34%)\n1%\n4%\n2%\niPad revenue\n(20%)\n(10%)\n(25%)\n(17%)\n24%\nWearables, home, and accessories revenue\n2%\n(3%)\n(11%)\n(10%)\n(2%)\nTotal revenue\n(1%)\n(1%)\n2%\n(4%)\n5%\nData source: Apple. Fiscal year ends in September. YOY = Year over year.\nApple's services segment was the only business that consistently grew over the past year. But that closely watched segment, which now serves more than 1 billion subscribers, faces unpredictable antitrust challenges in the U.S. and Europe as regulators probe its prioritization of first-party apps, developer restrictions, and high App Store fees.\nApple's iPhone sales slowed down as the 5G upgrade cycle ended. The company also faced tougher competition in China, and the strong dollar reduced overseas sales. But Mac sales -- which had experienced a growth spurt during the pandemic -- finally stabilized, as the company rolled out its new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Its iPad sales also finally rose again in the first quarter as the company launched the new iPad Air and iPad Pro.\nApple expects its growth to stabilize as it rolls out the iPhone 16 in September, ramps up expansion into India, and locks more users into its services ecosystem with a new batch of generative AI tools. It also continues to plow billions of dollars into its earnings-per-share (EPS) boosting buybacks. Analysts expect revenue and earnings to rise 8% and 16%, respectively, for the full year.\nAmazon and Apple both face macro and competitive challenges, but the market seemed more disappointed by Amazon's slowing e-commerce sales than Apple's sluggish iPhone sales. Neither of these stocks is cheap right now. Amazon trades at 39 times forward earnings, while Apple has a slightly lower forward multiple of 30.\nI own both of these stocks, but I'm not in a hurry to add more shares or trim my existing positions. But if I had to buy more shares of one over the other right now, I'd pick Apple instead of Amazon. It trades at a lower multiple, faces fewer near-term challenges, and has more visible catalysts on the horizon.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "What's Warren Buffett's biggest position in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio? If I were asked that question, my automatic response would be Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). But I'd be wrong.\nYes, Apple remains Buffett's biggest stock holding. However, it's not his biggest position. Buffett has more money invested in one asset than he does in Apple, American Express, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum combined.\nBerkshire Hathaway has big bucks invested in its five largest stock holdings. Its stake in Apple is worth $90.7 billion even after Buffett nearly halved the conglomerate's position in the iPhone maker. Berkshire's stake in AmEx totals close to $38.5 billion. Bank of America is a close third, with Berkshire's position weighing in at roughly $37 billion.\nThe next largest position in Berkshire's portfolio is Coca-Cola, with Buffett's 400 million shares worth around $28.3 billion. Two oil stocks round out the top six, Chevron and Occidental, with Berkshire's stakes totaling nearly $17.6 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively.\nIn aggregate, Berkshire's positions in these six stocks are currently valued at nearly $227 billion. That's a lot of money, but it isn't as much as Buffett has invested in another asset.\nAs of June 30, 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills totaled $238.7 billion. This amount includes $4.1 billion of the conglomerate's $42.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents invested in short-term U.S. Treasuries with maturities of three months or less.\nBerkshire has a standing policy to keep at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries. However, that threshold is much lower than the current level, which is the highest ever for the conglomerate. Why does Buffett have so much money invested in U.S. Treasuries right now?\nBuffett answered this question in his 2021 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. At the time, Berkshire's balance sheet included $120 billion of U.S. Treasuries plus another $24 billion in cash. He wrote then that the large amount was \"a consequence of my failure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.\"\nThat begs the question: What are Buffett's criteria for buying businesses and stocks? He has answered this one in the past, too. In the legendary investor's 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he would only invest in businesses and stocks that:\nHe could \"sensibly estimate\" an earnings range for at least five years in the future.\nHave a price that was reasonable compared to the lower boundary of the estimated earnings range.\nAre in his \"circle of competence.\"\nThere are undoubtedly lots of stocks for which Buffett can determine sensible future earnings estimates. Plenty of stocks are in his \"circle of competence\" as well. I think Berkshire's huge position in Treasuries is primarily due to stock valuations being too high for him to want to buy -- with a few exceptions, of course.\nYour investing goals are almost certainly different from Buffett's. But while I doubt most investors will want their largest position to be in U.S. Treasuries, having some of your portfolio in the asset could be wise. Treasuries are a great place to park your cash over the short term while you wait for a potential opportunity to buy stocks at more attractive prices.\nI think, though, that some areas of the market offer attractive valuations already. In particular, many small-cap stocks are bargains after lagging well behind large-cap stocks in recent years. With the likelihood that interest rate cuts are on the way, they could perform well going forward.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you\u2019d have $19,766!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $42,977!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $371,270!*\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of August 26, 2024\nAmerican Express is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-08-19, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $174.53. It's currently trading at a price of $226.05. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -29.52%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.57\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.87%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n89.93\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n84.59\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n174.53\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $154.88. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -45.95%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Caroline Valetkevitch ",
        "Text": "By Caroline Valetkevitch\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended with steep losses on Monday, leaving the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down at least 3% each as the market extended last week's sell-off amid U.S. recession worries and as Apple shares fell sharply on news that a big investor had cut its stake.\nAll three major indexes registered their biggest three-day percentage declines since June 2022, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed at their lowest levels since early May.\nThe recession fears shook global markets and drove investors out of risky assets following weak economic data last week, including Friday's soft U.S. payrolls report.\nInvestors worry that the economy is losing steam more rapidly than anticipated and that the Federal Reserve erred by keeping interest rates steady at its last policy meeting.\nShares of Apple fell 4.8% after Berkshire Hathaway halved its stake in the iPhone maker. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett also let cash at Berkshire soar to $277 billion.\nNvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet also slid, while the Cboe Volatility index, Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" had its highest close since Oct. 28, 2020. All 11 of the S&P 500 sectors fell, led by declines in technology.\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee downplayed recession fears, but said Fed officials need to be cognizant of changes in the environment to avoid being too restrictive with interest rates.\n\"Today we're seeing a sell-off as an extension of that anxiety that was felt last week,\" said Neville Javeri, portfolio manager and head of the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring in Washington.\nIt \"started off with the jobs data last week, and it clearly led to the belief that the Fed needs to start being more proactive around where those unemployment numbers are going,\" he said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,033.99 points, or 2.6%, to 38,703.27, the S&P 500 lost 160.23 points, or 3.00%, to 5,186.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 576.08 points, or 3.43%, to 16,200.08.\nThe S&P 500 was down more than 4% at its lowest level of the session, 5,119.26.\nIndexes trimmed losses in late morning after data showed U.S. services sector activity in July rebounded from a four-year low amid a rise in orders and employment.\nThe weak jobs report and shrinking manufacturing activity in the world's largest economy added to worries following recent disappointing forecasts from the big U.S. technology companies. The Nasdaq Composite on Friday confirmed it was in correction territory.\nTraders are now pricing in an 86% chance the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points at its next scheduled policy meeting in September, and a 14% chance of a 25 basis-point reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\nThe focus of the sell-off has been the so-called Magnificent Seven group of stocks, which previously had propelled the indexes to record highs this year.\nTraders also attributed some weakness in stocks to unwinding of sharp positions of carry trades, where investors borrow money from economies with low interest rates such as Japan or Switzerland to fund their bets in high-yielding assets elsewhere.\nPringles maker Kellanova soared 16.2% after a Reuters report said candy giant Mars was exploring a potential buyout of the company.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 16.50 billion shares, compared with the 12.29 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 9.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 6.44-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 26 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 14 new highs and 508 new lows.\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch in New YorkAdditional reporting by Shubham Batra and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru and Carolina Mandl in New YorkEditing by Arun Koyyur and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: 1 Unstoppable Stock Will Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club Within 3 Years",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has produced the world's most valuable companies for over a century. United States Steel became the first company to achieve a $1 billion valuation in 1901, and 117 years later, Apple became the first company to surpass a valuation of $1 trillion.\nApple was also the first company to cross the $2 trillion and $3 trillion thresholds. Only three other U.S. companies -- Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet \u2014 are valued at more than $2 trillion as of this writing, but I think one more is set to join them.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp, but it's also becoming a serious contender in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Meta is using AI to improve monetization on its social platforms, but it also developed the world's most advanced open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama.\nHere's how Meta could achieve a $2 trillion valuation within three years, and if it does, investors who buy the stock today could earn a 67% return.\nMeta serves over 3.2 billion people across its family of apps every single day. Social networks like Facebook and Instagram used to focus on connecting users with their friends and family, but they have transformed into entertainment platforms with AI-powered recommendation engines ensuring everybody sees the most relevant content, even if it wasn't posted by someone they know.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg says this shift is increasing the amount of time users spend on Meta's platforms, which means they view more ads and, therefore, become more valuable to the company. Speaking of which, Meta continues to develop AI tools for advertisers, too, which can help them create the most engaging content and target the most relevant audience.\nEventually, Zuckerberg says businesses will be able to tell Meta their objective and their budget, and its AI engine will autonomously handle the entire process for them \u2014 from crafting the creative to selecting the target audience. That's a game changer, because it means even the smallest business with no marketing team can yield the best possible return from its ad dollars.\nBut it gets better. Meta released a chatbot called Meta AI last year that can answer questions on most topics and even generate images on demand. It paves the way for Business AI, which could be a substantial revenue driver in the future. Zuckerberg believes every business will have its own AI agent trained to handle incoming queries from customers on Messenger and WhatsApp, for example, and even process sales. That will facilitate around-the-clock service even when the business owner is unavailable.\nLlama is the LLM that powers the exciting AI features I just mentioned. It's open-source, because Zuckerberg believes a widely deployed model used by thousands of developers will improve at a much faster rate than if Meta did all of the testing and troubleshooting alone.\nMeta just released Llama 3.1, and with 405 billion parameters, it's the most advanced version so far. Zuckerberg says Llama 3 is already competitive with most leading models, but he's focused on developing Llama 4, which he believes will set the standard for the industry next year.\nTraining Llama 4 will require up to 10 times the data center compute capacity compared to Llama 3, which means it will likely cost tens of billions of dollars in new infrastructure. I'll talk more about the cost in a moment, but better LLMs will result in more advanced user-facing AI applications, so Meta will have to invest heavily if it wants to stay ahead of the pack.\nOtherwise, users might spend more time on OpenAI's ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini instead of Meta AI, which could hurt the company's ability to generate revenue.\nMeta generated $39 billion in revenue during Q2, which was a 22% increase from the year-ago period. But the company's bottom line is the real story, because it continues to benefit from the cost-cutting measures enacted since late 2022. They involved 21,000 job cuts and a commitment from Zuckerberg to spend more cautiously on projects like the metaverse, which generate minimal revenue.\nAs a result, Meta's Q2 net income soared 73% year over year to $13.4 billion. That followed three straight quarters of triple-digit percentage growth.\nThe result was especially impressive when you consider the speed with which Meta is ramping up its capital expenditures for AI. It allocated $8.4 billion toward capex during Q2, which was up from the $6.3 billion it spent during the first quarter.\nMeta CFO Susan Li told investors capex could hit $40 billion for the whole of 2024, so spending appears set to accelerate in the second half of the year. Plus, Li forecasts \"significant\" growth in capex in 2025.\nNearly all of that money will go toward data center infrastructure, servers, and chips to accelerate the development of LLMs like Llama 4, which will bring new user-facing AI applications to life.\nBased on Meta's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $19.59 and its current stock price of around $488, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.9. That means it would have to rise 23% just to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 30.6. That alone would lift Meta's market cap to almost $1.5 trillion.\nBut Meta is even cheaper when measured against its future earnings. Wall Street expects the company to generate $23.93 in earnings per share during 2025, placing the stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 20.4. If that forecast is accurate and Meta's P/E ratio also rises to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 by the end of next year, that will place its valuation at $1.8 trillion.\nThat implies Meta will only have to grow its earnings per share by 11% in 2026 to warrant a $2 trillion valuation. Considering the company grew its earnings at a compound annual rate of almost 30% in the decade between 2014 and 2023, I say there is a very good chance it delivers.\nPlus, there is a strong possibility that AI is a more powerful tailwind for Meta than analysts expect right now. The company's growing portfolio of AI tools \u2014 especially for businesses \u2014 could drive up marketing spending and also pull ad dollars away from its competitors. There is no telling how big that opportunity might become.\nEven if it doesn't get there within three years, I think Meta has a clear path to join the $2 trillion club eventually.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

You can start this week.\nMicroStrategy has positioned itself as a major institutional player in the Bitcoin space, with CEO Michael Saylor, being one of the most prominent advocates for Bitcoin as digital gold, according to Edward Corona, trader and publisher at The Options Oracle Newsletter.\nLearn More: Here\u2019s How Much a $1,000 Investment in Ford Stock 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today\n\u201cGiven Trump\u2019s apparent support for bitcoin and cryptocurrency, as well as his close alliance with Elon Musk, who has long been a vocal advocate for crypto, there are a few stocks that stand out as potential big winners under a Trump presidency, with potentially favorable policies towards cryptocurrency,\u201d Corona said.\nAccording to Corona, Tesla\u2019s significant bitcoin holdings, combined with Musk\u2019s influence in the crypto space, make it a stock to watch.\n\u201cIf Trump\u2019s policies were to favor the crypto industry, Tesla could benefit not only from its core business but also from the appreciation of its bitcoin assets,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cMusk\u2019s continued support for cryptocurrency, especially with Trump in his corner, could further solidify Tesla\u2019s position in this space.\u201d\nAs the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Coinbase is well-positioned to capitalize on any pro-crypto policies that may emerge from a Trump administration, per Corona.\n\u201cIncreased regulatory clarity and support for the industry could drive more users and trading volume to Coinbase, potentially making it one of the standout stocks in a Trump-led economy,\u201d he added.\nUber\u00a0is \u201cdefinitely a stock to watch,\u201d said Joe Camberato, CEO, National Business Capital.\n\u201cIf Trump were to get re-elected, I believe he might loosen regulations, which could make it easier for companies like Uber and PayPal to operate and grow,\u201d he said.\nCamberato argued that he is always on the lookout for companies that have the potential to become as integrated in daily lives, such as Apple and Amazon, and noted that Uber is one of those companies.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re ordering a ride or food, Uber fundamentally changed how we go about our day-to-day activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many companies that have had this kind of impact and have lower market caps compared to the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech giants.\u201d\nNick Scibilia, founder, CEO, Orbit, said that the Palantir stock is the one that could be the next Apple if Trump wins the election.\n\u201cThe AI tech company has deep ties to U.S. Defense through government contracts for AI research and development, uniquely positioning itself to benefit from Trump\u2019s defense policies,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven their technology and growing influence in both government and private sectors, Palantir could very well be the standout stock to watch if Trump returns to office.\u201d\nConsidering the possibility of Trump winning another term, it\u2019s quite likely that energy giants such as Chevron and ExxonMobil will prosper, said Scibilia.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s administration has historically favored the fossil fuel industry, advocating for reduced regulations and encouraging drilling activities, which would likely continue,\u201d he added.\nDavid Materazzi, CEO, Galileo FX, said that a Trump victory would be a catalyst for several stocks to explode, one of them being Exxon.\n\u201cForget the green hype,\u201d said Materazzi. \u201cTrump\u2019s energy doctrine is all about unleashing the power of fossil fuels, and ExxonMobil is poised to cash in. With regulations tossed aside, XOM is ready to tap into a gusher of profits.\u201d\nMaterazzi said that in Trump\u2019s world, Johnson & Johnson isn\u2019t just a player, \u201cit\u2019s the enforcer in healthcare.\u201d\n\u201cFaster drug approvals and slashed red tape mean JNJ will bulldoze its way to the top, leaving competitors in the dust,\u201d he added.\nWith Trump on the offensive against big tech, Oracle is positioned to emerge as the ultimate tech stronghold, according to Materazzi.\n\u201cAmerica First policies will fortify ORCL\u2019s position, transforming it into an unassailable force in the industry,\u201d he added.\nMaterazzi also argued that Trump\u2019s infrastructure ambitions are \u201ca goldmine\u201d for Caterpillar.\n\u201cIn the construction boom that\u2019s coming, CAT\u2019s heavy machinery will be the backbone of America\u2019s rebuild, crushing the competition under its treads,\u201d he said.\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon If Trump Becomes President\n"

Delisted apps do not reflect the initiator of the delisting action, i.e., Apple or Google, or the app developer. While some apps are delisted for benign reasons, others are removed as a result of more nefarious behaviors, including ad fraud, and non-compliance with privacy regulations or app store policies, which may cause advertisers to be exposed to potential financial or legal risk as well. Because apps can be delisted for a variety of reasons, Pixalate is neither asserting nor assigning a reason for any delisting action. Additionally, the initiator of the delisting is not generally publicly-available information, so it is often not possible to know whether the removal was triggered by the app store or the developer.Pixalate\u2019s delisted apps research focuses on profile information and various insights observed in the programmatic advertising bid stream, such as the developer\u2019s country of registry, the level of app abandonment, and delisted apps with advertising (an app-ads.txt file).\nKey Findings:\nGoogle Play Store:\n1.1 million apps delisted, equating to 34% delisting rate compared to a historical average of 8%\n74% of delisted apps were abandoned (not updated in over two years) in Q2 2024, compared to 25% in Q2 2023\n39% of delisted apps were not updated in the last four years in Q2 2024, compared to 6% in Q2 2023\nApple App Store:\n57k apps were delisted, equating to 3% of apps being delisted compared to an average delisting rate of 8.2% in previous quarters\n46% of delisted apps were abandoned (not updated in over two years) in Q2 2024, similar to Q2 2023\n15% of delisted apps were not updated in the last four years in Q2 2024\nTop 10 Apps Delisted From Apple App Store in Q2 2024, as measured by Pixalate:Here are the top 10 delisted mobile apps in the Apple App Store by number of estimated user ratings:\nFood Network Kitchen\n\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc \u30c4\u30e0\u30c4\u30e0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\nGas\n\u753b\u50cf\u691c\u7d22\u3068\u753b\u50cf\u52a0\u5de5 - \u300c\u30d7\u30ea\u753b\u50cf\u300dbyGMO\nUltimate Disc 3D\nDriverKing - Get the Crown\n\u30df\u30cb\u56db\u99c6 \u8d85\u901f\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\nWOW Pixel - Live Wallpapers\nMighty DOOM\nDisney Sorcerer's Arena\nTop 10 Apps Delisted From Google Play Store in Q2 2024, as measured by Pixalate:\nHere are the top 10 delisted mobile apps in the Google Play Store by number of downloads:\nResso Music - Songs & Lyrics - 100+ Million Downloads\nXOS Launcher -Cool Stylish - 100+ Million Downloads\nReal Football - 100+ Million Downloads\nNoizz: video editor with music - 100+ Million Downloads\nHiOS Launcher - Fast - 100+ Million Downloads\nCraft World - Master Block 3D - 100+ Million Downloads\nBlock Crazy Robo World - 100+ Million Downloads\nKaraoke - Sing Unlimited Songs - 50+ Million Downloads\nDownload Manager for Android - 50+ Million Downloads\nBiugo-video maker&video editor - 50+ Million Downloads\nDownload the full reports\nDownload and explore a complimentary copy of the Q2 2024 Delisted Mobile Apps Report - Apple App Store and Google Play Store, which includes a list of the top 100 delisted apps by store with programmatic advertising (based on the presence of an app-ads.txt file).\nAbout Pixalate\nPixalate is a global platform specializing in privacy compliance, ad fraud prevention, and digital ad supply chain data intelligence.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 8, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \" The overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week\u2019sEarnings Trends\u00a0report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods,\u00a0please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\nFor the 431 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 86.2% of the index\u2019s total membership, total earnings are up +10.6% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.2% beating revenue estimates.\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.7% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nQ2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +33.5% from the same period last year on +14.3% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.2% (from +11.0%).\nThe \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 have been in the spotlight in the ongoing market turmoil. This followed these companies\u2019 Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market\u2019s issue with the Mag 7 companies\u2019 quarterly reports wasn\u2019t so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don\u2019t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.5% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.5%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. A big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "Title": "Is Apple Siri the Best AI Assistant in 2024?",
        "Author": "  Fatima Gulzar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Siri stands against the other AI assistants.\nAs we have mentioned in our article, \u201c10 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $1,\" the estimated value of the global artificial intelligence market in 2023 was $196.63 billion, and between 2024 and 2030, it is expected to increase at a CAGR of 36.6%.\nRegionally, in terms of revenue, the North American AI market held a 30.9% share in 2023, while from 2024 to 2030, the artificial intelligence industry in Europe is expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 33.2%, per Grand View Research. Moreover, the artificial intelligence and robotics markets in the United States have advanced significantly, with an estimated valuation of $42.00 billion in 2023.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau survey indicates that industry-specific AI adoption rates differ. The information and professional, scientific, and technical services sectors dominate in this regard, with 18% and 12% of businesses reporting present use of AI, respectively, while agriculture and construction have low AI adoption rates of 1% each.\nWith the launch of ChatGPT, AI technologies are still at the forefront of AI market trends. After launching in November 2022, OpenAI claims that ChatGPT, its AI tool, attracted over a million users in just five days. The Head of AI & Data at Deloitte Switzerland, Marc Beierschoder, is unequivocal on the significance of AI in day-to-day business, stating that \"AI is not a passing fad.\" In the distant past, a dazzling toy that would momentarily enhance a company's reputation for innovation has evolved into a vital instrument for smooth corporate operations. Particularly, employees are already accustomed to using generative AI technologies like ChatGPT and DALL-E, which generate fresh content in the form of text, photos, audio files, or videos.\nIf 2023 was the year that generative AI (Gen AI) was first introduced to the world, then 2024 is the year that businesses really started utilizing this new technology and reaping its benefits. According to the McKinsey Global AI May 30, 2024 Survey, 65% of participants claimed their companies use generative artificial intelligence on a regular basis. This is almost twice as many as the survey's results from just 10 months ago. Respondents' expectations for Gen AI's impact are as high as they were last year, with three-quarters forecasting major or disruptive change in their industry in the next years.\nAnother study by PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence, \"Sizing the Prize: Exploiting the AI Revolution,\" examines the enormous potential that artificial intelligence holds for economies and businesses. According to the study, artificial intelligence could boost GDP in local economies by up to 26% and add an incredible $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. As businesses look to \"augment\" the productivity of their labor force using AI technology and automate some jobs and roles, advances in labor productivity will fuel initial GDP growth. Additionally, the analysis indicates that by 2030, improvements to products will drive up consumer demand and account for 45% of all economic gains. This is due to the fact that AI will eventually lead to a wider range of products that are more affordable, individualized, and attractive. China and North America stand to gain the most from AI, with China's GDP expected to rise by 26% and 14.5%, respectively, to reach a total of $10.7 trillion, which represents over 70% of the global economic impact.\nTo pick out the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024, we searched the internet for the best AI assistants in 2024 and ranked them based on their number of appearances in our sources, so each appearance got one Insider Monkey score. Then we ranked the list based on the aggregated scores.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nInsider Monkey Score: 11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAI-powered Siri is a virtual assistant included in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s watchOS, tvOS, and iOS operating systems. It makes recommendations, executes commands, and responds to questions by using voice recognition to assign requests to online services. Siri is well known for its strong safety and easy-to-use interface.\nApple is planning to replace Siri with AI to manage different application features. The concept is to use voice to control functionality within specific apps.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\u201d\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best AI assistants in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

An unapologetic activist, Penner is throwback to a time before a softer brand of \u201cconstructivism\u201d took over. He spent 15 years at Jana Partners, tilting at Time Warner and Whole Foods, among other companies, at the height of that firm\u2019s muscle. In 2018, he led a campaign to force Apple to reckon with the effects of smartphone use on kids\u2019 mental health; six months later, the company rolled out new tools to limit screen time.\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), often referred to as \"The Oracle of Omaha,\" is a towering figure in the world of investing. As the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, he transformed a modest textile company into a major conglomerate, primarily focusing on insurance and other diverse investments. Buffett's investment philosophy is deeply influenced by Benjamin Graham, emphasizing long-term value investing, understanding of the business, and a strong margin of safety. His strategies and investment choices are closely monitored by investors globally for insights and trends.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, Buffett made notable increases in several stocks within his portfolio:\nChubb Ltd (NYSE:CB) saw an addition of 5,823,840 shares, bringing the total to 25,923,840 shares. This increase of 28.97% in share count had a 0.46% impact on the current portfolio, valuing it at approximately $6,717,644,660.\nLiberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMK) was also significantly boosted by 22,277,997 shares, reaching a new total of 65,486,288 shares. This adjustment represents a 51.56% increase in share count, with a total value of $1,945,597,620.\nIn the same quarter, Buffett decided to exit completely from certain positions:\nHP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) was completely sold out, with Buffett disposing of all 22,852,715 shares, which had a -0.2% impact on the portfolio.\nBuffett's strategy also included reducing positions in several companies:\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a significant reduction of 116,191,550 shares, decreasing the share count by 12.83% and impacting the portfolio by -6.36%. Apple's stock traded at an average price of $181.83 during the quarter and has seen an 18.56% return over the past three months and 17.14% year-to-date.\nParamount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) shares were reduced by 55,790,726, marking an 88.11% decrease in shares and a -0.24% impact on the portfolio. The stock's average trading price was $12.58 during the quarter, with a -11.63% return over the past three months and -24.63% year-to-date.\nAs of the second quarter of 2024, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio comprised 41 stocks. The top holdings were notably concentrated in several sectors, with significant percentages in major companies:\n30.09% in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), 14.67% in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), 12.54% in American Express Co (NYSE:AXP), 9.09% in Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), and 6.63% in Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX).

        "Title": "Prediction: 2 Growth Stocks (Under $100 Billion) Will Join Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft as $1 Trillion Companies by 2040",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Currently, only seven public companies have a market capitalization that exceeds $1 trillion. From largest to smallest, the members of that elite group include: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Saudi Aramco, and Meta Platforms.\nMore companies will undoubtedly reach the trillion-dollar threshold as the global economy continues to expand. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway and Taiwan Semiconductor are worth more than $800 billion today, and another nine companies are worth more than $500 billion, which puts them within striking distance.\nHowever, I'd like to make a somewhat aggressive prediction: Despite sub-$100 billion valuations today, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) will be worth $1 trillion by 2040. The implications for shareholders are detailed below:\nShopify is currently worth $75 billion. To reach $1 trillion, the stock must increase 1,233%, which implies annual returns of 19% over the next 15 years.\nMercadoLibre is currently worth $80 billion. To reach $1 trillion, the stock must increase 1,150%, which implies annual returns of 18% over the next 15 years.\nHere's what investors should know about these e-commerce giants.\nShopify provides merchants with a turnkey solution for commerce. Its software supports sales across physical and digital channels, including online marketplaces, social media, and direct-to-consumer websites. Shopify also provides adjacent solutions for marketing, payments, and logistics, and the company recently introduced a generative AI assistant that can write product descriptions and create professional product images.\nIn August 2023, research company Gartner ranked Shopify as a leader in digital commerce, citing its robust portfolio and rapid innovation. In May 2024, Forrester Research named Shopify a leader in business-to-business (B2B) commerce solutions, citing rapid innovation and strength in artificial intelligence. Shopify began adding B2B functionality to its high-end platform (Shopify Plus) about two years ago, so recognition from Forrester is encouraging.\nShopify has a few monetization levers left to pull. It does not currently charge for its generative AI assistant (Shopify Magic), nor does it charge for Shopify Audiences, a marketing tool that uses machine learning to create audience lists, which can be used to target ad campaigns across Alphabet's Google Search and YouTube, Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok.\nGoing forward, e-commerce software sales are projected to increase at 15% through 2030, and B2B e-commerce sales are forecasted to grow at 18% annually during the same period. But Shopify could grow more quickly than those figures suggests. Shopify is the most popular e-commerce platform, and Shopify Plus is the most popular omnichannel commerce software, such that Shopify merchants accounted for 10% and 6% of online retail sales across the U.S. and Western Europe, respectively, last year.\nHere's the bottom line: Shopify could be a trillion-dollar company within 15 years if sales grow at 19% annually through 2039 and the stock trades at 10 times sales. For context, that would be a slight discount to the current valuation of 10.2 times sales, which itself is a significant discount to the three-year average of 17.1 times sales.\nMercadoLibre operates the largest online marketplace in Latin America as measured by visitors and sales, and the company is still gaining market share. MercadoLibre is forecasted to account for 29% of retail e-commerce sales in Latin America in 2024, up nearly one percentage point from 2023 and four percentage points from 2020, according to eMarketer.\nMercadoLibre's success is partially due to its early-mover status, but the company has also built an ecosystem of supporting services that make its marketplace more compelling. That includes fintech services like payment processing and credit cards, logistics services like fulfillment and shipping, and advertising services. Those adjacencies accelerate the network effect inherent to its business model.\nMercadoLibre operates across 18 countries with a combined population of 516 million, meaning it serves a population that is roughly 50% larger than the U.S. But the digital economy is much smaller. For instance, e-commerce penetration in Latin America is about half that of the U.S. But the Latin American digital economy is growing quickly. In fact, it's expected to double in size during the next three years .\n\"Latin America has transformed into a flourishing hub of digital innovation thanks to widespread internet access,\" according to eMarketer. MercadoLibre is ideally positioned to benefit from that transformation. It not only operates the leading e-commerce marketplace in the region but also ranks as the largest retail advertiser and one of the largest fintech companies in Latin America. To that end, Wall Street expects sales to grow at 19% annually through 2027.\nHere's the bottom line: MercadoLibre could be a trillion-dollar company within 15 years if sales grow at 18% annually through 2039 and shares trade at 5 times sales. For context, that would be a slight discount to its current valuation of 5.2 times sales, which itself is a discount to the three-year average of 6.6 times sales.\nBefore you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Shopify wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 15, 2024\u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% in the first quarter of 2022.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of a stable and improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% in the first quarter of 2022.\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.3% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nThe Q3 negative revisions trend is far bigger than what we had seen in the comparable periods of the preceding two quarters. Estimates have come down for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Energy, Medical, Transportation, and Business Services sectors. Estimates for the Tech and Finance sectors have gone up.\nThe 'Magnificent 7' stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 were in the spotlight in the recent market turmoil. This followed these companies' Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market's issue with the Mag 7 companies' quarterly reports wasn't so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don't see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.4% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.6%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year's record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector's productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year's +8.1% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +7.8%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year's earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.
