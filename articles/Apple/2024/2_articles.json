        "Text": "The Apple (AAPL) car is dead. And with no big, splashy products to look forward to, Wall Street is pinning its hopes for the tech giant\u2019s immediate future on, what else, generative AI.\nIn his initial report on Apple\u2019s decision to shutter its automotive efforts, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman said a number of the 2,000 employees previously assigned to the project will move over to the company\u2019s artificial intelligence division where they\u2019ll work on getting Apple\u2019s generative AI chops up to snuff.\nThe news helped briefly buoy shares of Apple Tuesday, sending them to an intraday high of $183.92 before closing out the day at $182.63. Shares of Apple were trading at $180.33 midday Thursday.\nApple is the second-wealthiest company in the world by market valuation, behind only Microsoft (MSFT), with a market cap of $2.77 trillion. But the iPhone maker is also contending with a choppy smartphone market that has investors wondering where the company\u2019s next leg of growth will come from.\nAnd, short of a fully redesigned iPhone, it looks like generative AI is the only new product that could help goose device and services sales.\nBut Apple, as is its M.O., has been tight-lipped about its generative AI efforts. CEO Tim Cook hasn\u2019t offered any insights into the kind of capabilities the company is exploring via the technology or if they\u2019ll come to market this year.\nDuring Apple\u2019s latest earnings call, Cook said he is excited to show off what the company has been working on and that it will debut its efforts this year. He later said generative AI is a huge opportunity for Apple. During the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, the CEO said Apple is investing significantly in AI and will break new ground in generative AI later this year.\nThat means we\u2019ll likely learn more about Apple\u2019s generative AI plans during its upcoming WWDC conference, which typically takes place in June. And the pressure is on for those announcements to be more than a few new photo editing tools or kitschy features that let you change the tone of your text messages to sound like Shakespeare.\n\u201cWe believe Apple is set to launch a host of new Gen AI software features at WWDC in early June, which we see as a key event helping to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note following the Bloomberg report.\nIn his own note, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives said he believes \u201cApple will incorporate generative AI into iPhone 16 and this will mark the start of a new frontier of growth for the golden installed base of Cupertino.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said the addition of the former vehicle engineers and developers could accelerate Apple\u2019s AI initiatives over the next 12 to 18 months.\nThe generative AI craze has driven shares of Apple\u2019s rivals ever higher, including Microsoft, which eclipsed Apple as the most valuable publicly traded company thanks to its investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and others have similarly jumped on the generative AI bandwagon with their own announcements and product launches.\nBut diving into the deep end of generative AI is a double-edged sword. Sure, those companies get the fanfare and excitement that comes along with a new generative AI-powered service, but when those services falter, tech firms are left holding the bag. Just look at Google, which pulled its Gemini AI image generator after the software produced images of ethnically diverse Nazis.\nThat adds additional pressure to Apple to not only hit the market with a bang but also ensure what it rolls out is as bulletproof as possible. We\u2019ll find out if the company has the goods when WWDC kicks off in June.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s longest-serving senior industrial designer is leaving the company, marking the near-complete turnover of a team once led by Jony Ive.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump, Sons and Associate Hit With $364 Million Fraud Fine\nAlexey Navalny, Jailed Activist Who Defied Putin, Dies at 47\nWall Street Ends Wild Week on Sour Note After PPI: Markets Wrap\nHawaii Rightly Rejects Supreme Court\u2019s Gun Nonsense\nApple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot\nBart Andre, who joined Apple in 1992 alongside Ive, told colleagues this month that he is retiring, according to people familiar with the matter. Andre was one of the last remaining designers from the Ive era and helped create the aesthetic for Apple products released over the past three decades \u2014 even prior to Steve Jobs returning to the helm in the late 1990s.\nThe designer was known as one of Ive\u2019s top lieutenants and helped run the team after former chief Evans Hankey, Ive\u2019s successor, departed last year. He\u2019s also known as one of the biggest holders of Apple patents.\n\u201cHis mark on Apple products is indelible \u2014 I see him every day in the details,\u201d said Christopher Stringer, who used to work with Andre at Apple and now runs sound company Syng.\nThe departure is the latest in recent months for the group. Top designers Colin Burns, Shota Aoyagi and Peter Russell-Clarke all left around the end of last year. Multiple longtime designers on Apple\u2019s software design team have also signaled they are planning to leave in the near future.\nBoth the industrial-design and user-interface groups are overseen by Jeff Williams, the company\u2019s chief operating officer. He\u2019s held that role since Ive\u2019s departure in 2019 but took on direct management of the industrial-design team last year when Hankey left.\nHaving an operations person oversee a division dedicated to design and innovation has rankled some staff, according to the people close to the situation. There have also been cost-cutting measures that have added to the unrest, they said. Under Ive, the team embarked on exploratory projects that didn\u2019t necessarily have an immediate payoff \u2014 something that\u2019s been reined in.\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nIve\u2019s core design team was made up of about two dozen people for well over a decade. Around the time Ive left in 2019, an exodus began. Nearly all of the senior designers who reported directly to Ive have now left. Many of them joined LoveFrom, a design firm founded by Ive that worked with Apple until two years ago.\nThe industrial-design team has been replenished with new outside talent, but there are few longtime members remaining who worked under Ive and helped create hit products like the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Richard Howarth, who serves as vice president of design, is a carryover from the Ive era, along with Molly Anderson and Duncan Kerr.\nSince Hankey\u2019s departure, the most senior designers have led the team\u2019s day-to-day operations, working alongside Williams. The operating chief was picked to manage the group, in part, so that he could better coordinate with the manufacturing team. There also was a lack of other viable options to replace Hankey.\nRead More: Apple\u2019s Brain Drain Hinders Efforts to Pick Its Next Jony Ive\nThe Apple design team is tasked with devising the look and feel of devices and software, as well as developing new features and interfaces. That includes minute details like the sound of ringtones and alerts from an iPhone.\nThe group was central to the creation of the company\u2019s last two product categories, the Apple Watch and Vision Pro. The watch\u2019s design was spearheaded by Ive, who also helped craft the iMac, iPod and iPhone.

        "Title": "After Skyrocketing 615%, Why Does Warren Buffett Still Own Apple Stock?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Many people believe that Warren Buffett is the greatest investor ever. As the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has held many winning investments.\nPerhaps his most successful is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The conglomerate first started buying shares in the iPhone maker during the first quarter of 2016. And since the start of that year, shares have skyrocketed an incredible 615%.\nA whopping 45.7% of Berkshire's entire portfolio is represented by just Apple. With such a high weighting, coupled with a market cap of $2.9 trillion and a price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of 30.4, it forces one to wonder why the Oracle of Omaha still owns Apple today.\nI think there are four reasons why this might be the case.\nBuffett's investment strategy has long focused on finding outstanding businesses and aiming to hold them for a long time. In fact, his favorite holding period is forever.\nApple has the makings of a forever stock. Its incredibly powerful brand supports its economic moat. And because customers are also using the company's software and services more, Apple has an ecosystem that drives stickiness. These traits have helped support the business's financial success.\nThe added benefit of having an indefinite holding period is that it doesn't trigger a taxable event. This means compounding isn't interrupted unnecessarily.\nWhen picking stocks to invest in, the hope is that they can beat the market over the long term. Despite its huge market cap and premium valuation, Buffett might still believe that Apple has the potential to produce strong returns going forward.\nWith dividends reinvested, the S&P 500 has historically returned an average of about 10% per year. This is a difficult hurdle for most active managers to beat. But Buffett may think there is a high chance that Apple can outperform the broader index.\nIf this is the case, then there's absolutely no reason why he should sell, especially since he probably has expert knowledge about the business after owning it for all these years.\nBerkshire owns a 5.9% stake in Apple thanks to its holding of nearly 916 million shares. This massive position provides a financial windfall.\nApple pays a dividend that yields a measly 0.52%. But based on the current quarterly payout of $0.24, Buffett's firm receives an annualized $879 million from its equity position in the tech giant.\nApple uses the vast majority of its free cash flow to retire its outstanding stock. From the end of fiscal 2018 through the end of 2023, the business saw its share count shrink by 21%, a capital-allocation policy that increases Berkshire's ownership stake.\nIn this instance, it's very easy to come up with reasons for why Apple should be sold right now. But let's also consider the opportunity cost. If Buffett sold the entire position today, what would Berkshire do with the almost $170 billion in proceeds?\nThis sizable cash infusion would only exacerbate the conglomerate's problem. It already has $152 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury bills on the balance sheet, a sum that Buffett hasn't seemed to have had much use for in terms of finding compelling investments. He would likely have no idea what to do with more money that would come from selling Apple.\nThis tells me that even though a valid argument can be made that at its current size and expensive valuation it should be sold, Apple still provides a better potential return than just holding cash. This might be what Buffett is thinking.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": " Alexandra Canal    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Watching an NFL season these days means viewers must subscribe to various streaming services in addition to a pricey cable package. That's not the case with professional US soccer.\nMajor League Soccer (MLS) said its desire to avoid what has become a fragmented viewing landscape for sports fans is what led it to sign an exclusive 10-year, $2.5 billion agreement with Apple (AAPL) in 2022.\n\"We think that the deal we did set the bar at a different level for people to think about how you do a partnership with a media company,\" Seth Bacon, executive vice president of media for MLS, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \"We're completely ingrained in Apple ecosystem with everything that we do. It's a true partnership.\"\nSo far the partnership appears to be paying off as sign-ups surge and viewership numbers skyrocket.\nApple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue said at a conference in November that each of the biggest MLS games last season attracted more than a million viewers on the service, noting \"no one expected that.\"\nThere's additional upside for Apple too. Matthew Ball, author of the bestselling book \"The Metaverse\" and former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, said in a new Stratechery podcast interview that Apple's MLS deal will likely amplify sales of the tech giant's new Vision Pro headset.\n\"There\u2019s a pretty good chance that in a few weeks or at least a year when [Lionel] Messi takes a free kick, I\u2019m going to get to be able to wander onto the field and stand right beside him at the box and watch or take the keeper\u2019s position,\" he predicted. \"And that I think is going to be remarkable and probably push this device in a way that we could never have imagined a year ago.\"\n\"When we started the process of reviewing our media rights at the end of 2017, we started to look down the road a little bit,\" Bacon said. \"We started to see that the world was going to look very different [and] that streaming was going to play a big part in it.\"\nThe league strategically consolidated all of its media rights about three years before the negotiation window for the rights opened. The goal? Create \"one big package\" to offer potential domestic partners.\nBacon explained the league, which kicked off its 2024 season last week, wanted to offer something \"completely different\" in the way games were distributed. That captured Apple's attention as it allowed the tech giant to control how it presented and delivered the game.\nAdditionally, the exclusive nature of the decades-long deal provided Apple the flexibility to fully invest in new concepts in order to deliver a more consistent fan experience.\nAs for MLS, the league knew Apple had the global distribution capabilities and would be able to amplify the brand on a much larger scale.\nOf course, it didn't hurt that Apple and MLS received a big boost from Argentine soccer legend Messi, who signed a historic MLS deal with Inter Miami in June.\nMessi's deal instantly led to a surge in ticket sales, sports apparel, and, most importantly, sign-ups to Apple's streaming package MLS Season Pass.\nSubscribers to the package \"over-delivered on expectations\" and have more than doubled since July, according to the league. Spanish language viewership has also surged, surpassing over 50% for Messi matches.\nAnalytics platform Antenna revealed that 110,000 users signed up for MLS Season Pass on the day of Messi's debut, representing a 280% increase from the number of sign-ups generated on the first day of the 2023 season. To note, Apple does not disclose subscriber figures.\nThe MLS partnership extends beyond just the live event games.\nEarlier this year, MLS and Apple announced an all-access docuseries, produced in partnership with Box to Box Films, the filmmakers behind Netflix's \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive.\"\nBacon said the docuseries is just the beginning given Apple's exposure to not only original content production but also music, podcasts, news, and fitness. The tech giant also just debuted a sports app that will provide users with real-time scores, betting lines, stats, and more.\n\"In the long haul, Apple is the place that we're pushing people,\" Bacon concluded. \"There's a huge amount of incentive for us and for our fans to lean into Apple and help grow the sport.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Apple is dispelling a piece of conventional wisdom followed by iPhone users who accidentally get their devices wet. The company is warning against putting wet phones in uncooked rice to dry them out.\nIn new guidance for salvaging phones that come into contact with liquid, Apple is advising users to let them dry out on their own, rather than by submerging them in uncooked rice.\nMany people rely on uncooked rice to dry out wet electronics because the grains absorb liquids quickly \u2014 but Apple said that the technique can actually damage your iPhone.\n\"Don't put your iPhone in a bag of rice\"\nApple is telling iPhone users explicitly what not to do when a \"Liquid Detected\" warning appears on screen.\n\"Don't put your iPhone in a bag of rice. Doing so could allow small particles of rice to damage your iPhone,\" the company says.\nAlso, when a \"Liquid Detected\" alert appears on a phone's screen, don't try to charge the device until both the phone and the cable are completely dry, Apple said.\n\"If you charge your iPhone while the Lightning or USB-C connector is wet, the pins on the connector or cable can corrode and cause permanent damage or stop functioning, causing connectivity issues for your iPhone or accessory,\" Apple explains.\nTap the phone and leave it in a dry area\nInstead, unplug the phone from its power adapter, and gently tap the phone against your hand, with the charging port facing down, in order to let excess liquid drain from the device. Then leave the iPhone in a dry area with airflow, Apple says.\nA wireless iPhone charger also won't cause damage.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can try to reconnect the device to a power adapter. An alert will indicate if liquid remains in the phone, with Apple noting that It could take up to 24 hours for a device to completely dry out.\nAlso avoid trying to dry it with an external heat source or compressed air. For example, don't use a hair dryer, and avoid inserting cotton swabs and other objects into the connector to try to absorb any liquid, the company said.\nNikki Haley vows to continue campaign through Super Tuesday\n7-year-old girl dies after beach hole collapsed on her and her brother\nHaley defies calls from Trump to drop out of 2024 race\n"

        "Author": "  Ryan Hogg ",
        "Text": "We\u2019ve all had that moment where we realize we need to be wary of GPS. You track down a highly recommended restaurant on Google Maps only to find it moved locations a couple of weeks ago. Or you take an Apple Maps\u2013approved shortcut straight into a dead end. On rare occasions, you might even find yourself unwittingly barreling down a flight of Edinburgh steps.\nThat last one might sound like hyperbole, but it\u2019s an issue a surprising number of drivers in the capital of Scotland found themselves in over the past couple of months.\nThe issue became widespread enough that the City of Edinburgh Council was forced to get in touch with Apple and Google to ask the tech giants to update their GPS, short for \u201cglobal positioning system,\u201d after out-of-date maps left multiple drivers stranded in a stairway beside a pub.\nThe council installed steps on the city\u2019s Greenside Lane and blocked the road off from traffic as part of street design guidance that sought to make the street similar to others in the city, including those linking to the famous Royal Mile.\nHowever, those updates weren\u2019t reflected in Apple Maps or Google Maps, which continued to direct drivers down the path.\nReports began to emerge last month that the issue was leading to cars getting stuck on the steps beside the Theatre Royal Bar, with the Metro reporting that a Toyota Prius and SUV were known victims of the mix-up.\nAmused residents have taken to social media to publicize a trend that was at risk of becoming endemic, and also appears to have affected heavy-duty transit vans and delivery vehicles.\nOne of those unfortunate people, an unnamed delivery driver, told BBC Scotland: \u201cI was just following the satnav [satellite-based navigation]. I always remember I used to come down this way. I followed it and just got stuck.\n\u201cI had no idea there was a step there; I used to come down this way. I am a bit embarrassed about it.\u201d\nIn a paper published last week, the council said it had been made aware the change had led vehicles to careen into the steps.\nA representative for the City of Edinburgh told Fortune that Google had updated its GPS to reflect that Greenside Lane was no longer suitable for cars, while Apple had been asked to make a correction.\nFortune has approached Apple for comment.\nAn experiment carried out by Fortune using both Google Maps and Apple Maps shows drivers are no longer directed down Greenside Lane. A representative for Google confirmed to Fortune that it had updated its map as soon as it was made aware of the change.\nWhile it waited to confirm the maps had been updated, the council installed a temporary barrier to prevent further accidents from happening.\nCouncillor Scott Arthur, the city\u2019s transport and environment committee convener, said: \u201cThe footpath in this area is incredibly busy, so these incidents are really concerning.\n\u201cWhile we would expect drivers to use common sense in a situation like this, we are going to install temporary barriers this week to prevent it happening again.\n\u201cSatnav is an incredibly useful tool, but it\u2019s no substitute for common sense. Cars and trucks don\u2019t go down steps.\u201d\nGPS, or as Brits call it, \u201csatnav,\u201d has improved by leaps and bounds since it was first popularized among consumers as an in-car attachment.\nAccording to Google, the maps are updated constantly or, to quote its maps group: \u201cliterally, every second of every day!\u201d The group appears to use a \u201cSwiss cheese model\u201d of risk management, where layered defenses minimize the possibility of a notable error occurring.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly collecting new information about the world, whether from satellite imagery and Street View cars, or Google Maps users and local business owners, and using that information to update the map.\u201d\nBut smaller updates, including the placement of a few steps, are much harder for satellites to pick up on a map, and updates may slip through the net.\nOn this occasion, it seems Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s various avenues for updating maps fell short in Edinburgh.\nThe accidents in Scotland\u2019s capital, which didn\u2019t lead to any reported injuries, offer a sobering reminder of the limits of modern-day technology, particularly as drivers begin to embrace autonomous driving.\nAnd the incident serves as a reminder: Next time you\u2019re directed down a side street, make sure to double-check what\u2019s really there.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": " Mariella Moon    \u00b7 Contributing Reporter",
        "Text": "Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg has posted a review of Apple's Vision Pro on Instagram, reminding us all that the rivalry between the two companies has deepened even further with the launch of the latter's mixed reality headset. In the video shot with a Meta Quest 3, Zuckerberg didn't mince words while pitting the Vision Pro against his company's device. He said he originally expected the Quest to be the better value for most people, because it's \"like seven times less expensive\" than the $3,500 Vision Pro. However, after testing his competitor's product, he came to the conclusion that the Quest \"is the better product, period.\"\nHe added that the Quest is \"better for the vast majority of things that people use mixed reality for.\" Zuckerberg said he thinks the Quest is \"a lot more comfortable,\" since Meta designed it to be light and portable, so that people could use it while moving around or even while hanging out with friends and socializing. He found the Quest's field of view to be wider and its screen to be brighter than the Vision Pro, and he also found that Meta's headset showed crisper visuals when he moved his head while wearing it. Apple's device, he said, had motion blur.\nZuckerberg acknowledged that the Vision Pro has a screen with a higher resolution, but in the same breath, he criticized Apple for the \"tradeoffs\" it had to make to the device's comfort and ergonomics. While Quest's controllers are \"a little more accurate,\" he admits that Apple's eye tracking is \"really nice.\" Apparently, Meta used the Vision Pro's sensors for the Quest Pro but took them out for the Quest 3. The company is planning to bring them back in the future. Of course, Zuckerberg took the chance to talk about the Quest's bigger library and to emphasize that the Quest, unlike the Vision Pro, has access to the YouTube and Xbox apps. Zuckerberg ended his review by talking about open and closed models for every generation of computing and how he wants to make sure that for this generation, Meta's technology, as the open model, \"wins out\" like Microsoft's did in the past.\n"

Matthew Ball, author of the bestselling book \"The Metaverse\" and former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, said in a new Stratechery podcast interview that Apple's MLS deal will likely amplify sales of the tech giant's new Vision Pro headset.\n\"There\u2019s a pretty good chance that in a few weeks or at least a year when [Lionel] Messi takes a free kick, I\u2019m going to get to be able to wander onto the field and stand right beside him at the box and watch or take the keeper\u2019s position,\" he predicted. \"And that I think is going to be remarkable and probably push this device in a way that we could never have imagined a year ago.\"\n\"When we started the process of reviewing our media rights at the end of 2017, we started to look down the road a little bit,\" Bacon said. \"We started to see that the world was going to look very different [and] that streaming was going to play a big part in it.\"\nThe league strategically consolidated all of its media rights about three years before the negotiation window for the rights opened. The goal? Create \"one big package\" to offer potential domestic partners.\nBacon explained the league, which kicked off its 2024 season last week, wanted to offer something \"completely different\" in the way games were distributed. That captured Apple's attention as it allowed the tech giant to control how it presented and delivered the game.\nAdditionally, the exclusive nature of the decades-long deal provided Apple the flexibility to fully invest in new concepts in order to deliver a more consistent fan experience.\nAs for MLS, the league knew Apple had the global distribution capabilities and would be able to amplify the brand on a much larger scale.\nOf course, it didn't hurt that Apple and MLS received a big boost from Argentine soccer legend Messi, who signed a historic MLS deal with Inter Miami in June.\nMessi's deal instantly led to a surge in ticket sales, sports apparel, and, most importantly, sign-ups to Apple's streaming package MLS Season Pass.\nSubscribers to the package \"over-delivered on expectations\" and have more than doubled since July, according to the league. Spanish language viewership has also surged, surpassing over 50% for Messi matches.\nAnalytics platform Antenna revealed that 110,000 users signed up for MLS Season Pass on the day of Messi's debut, representing a 280% increase from the number of sign-ups generated on the first day of the 2023 season. To note, Apple does not disclose subscriber figures.\nThe MLS partnership extends beyond just the live event games.\nEarlier this year, MLS and Apple announced an all-access docuseries, produced in partnership with Box to Box Films, the filmmakers behind Netflix's \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive.\"\nBacon said the docuseries is just the beginning given Apple's exposure to not only original content production but also music, podcasts, news, and fitness. The tech giant also just debuted a sports app that will provide users with real-time scores, betting lines, stats, and more.\n\"In the long haul, Apple is the place that we're pushing people,\" Bacon concluded. \"There's a huge amount of incentive for us and for our fans to lean into Apple and help grow the sport.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "In the ever-changing world of technology, predicting the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become an enthralling pursuit for investors and tech enthusiasts. This quest extends beyond the hunt for a firm with ground-breaking goods or a high market capitalization. It is about finding a visionary force poised to alter the technology industry. As we explore the enormous ocean of tech stocks, the excitement grows, with each challenger bringing its own unique combination of innovation and promise to the fore.\nThe attractiveness of technology equities stems from their portrayal of the cutting edge, the driving force behind our fast-changing environment. Within this sector, the next Apple emerges as a symbol of revolutionary potential, embodied by a pioneering mentality and innovative technology capable of redefining industry standards.\nNavigating this mission needs a sharp eye, as the field is packed with both giants and rising stars, each adding to a vivid and ever-changing story. The real issue is to separate the actual innovators from the herd, those who follow Apple\u2019s storied path.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nThis quest is more than simply analysis; it is about discovering the core of what makes a tech stock actually stand out. As we go further, we want to highlight the most potential prospects by harnessing insights that cut through market swings. Join us on this fascinating excursion where innovation meets opportunity. The next great breakthrough might be just around the corner.\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\nTesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) path is similar to the early days of the company that is now thought to be the next Apple. The company\u2019s latest price changes show that it is in a great position in the market. This approach is similar to Apple\u2019s ability to balance high value with what customers want. Also, Tesla\u2019s creative events not only keep its community interested, but they also show off its huge network of Superchargers. It\u2019s a smart way to show off tech skills, similar to how Apple\u2019s environment works together so smoothly.\nAt the same time, Tesla\u2019s building projects in Mexico and smart agreements for materials show that the company is dedicated to both growth and ecology. These moves are in line with Apple\u2019s goals of going global and using responsible suppliers. Putting Tesla on Morningstar\u2019s \u201cpick list\u201d makes it even more appealing to investors, similar to how Apple rose in the eyes of investors.\nAdditionally, Tesla is still very focused on new ideas. Recent improvements in car technology and safety have set new standards for the industry. The release of a new Model 3 with cutting-edge features shows that Tesla is always trying to be the best. Tesla, like Apple, doesn\u2019t just make goods; it shapes the direction of its business as well.\nSource: ST.art/Shutterstock\nIn the world of online shopping, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is quickly becoming the next Apple. Its stock value has recently gone up, which shows that investors are becoming more confident. Improvements to business tools show that Shopify is always trying to be the best. In addition, technical changes will make the software run better.\nIn terms of being environmentally friendly, Shopify\u2019s promise to get rid of carbon emissions stands out. This project shows that it is committed to caring for the earth. Additionally, results from a Shopify poll put light on how customers act, providing businesses with useful information.\nFocusing on business-to-business (B2B) sales for 2024 is a big change for Shopify. This move shows that there may be ways to grow. Record sales between Black Friday and Cyber Monday also show how useful the platform is.\nShopify\u2019s finances have been in good shape. Its sales went up 25% and its gross profit went up 36% in the third quarter. This result shows that Shopify is both operationally and financially stable.\nIn short, Shopify is making moves to become the leader in online shopping. It\u2019s like software giants like Apple in that it cares about new ideas, the environment, and its own bottom line. This is a good sign for Shopify\u2019s future.\nSource: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock.com\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stands out in a world full of new ideas, just like Apple did in its early days. It just finished its biggest Data, Apps, and AI event, where it showed off ground-breaking creative AI advances. These improvements make it possible for businesses to make apps on a scale never seen before. Also, Snowflake\u2019s move into Snowpark Container Services is a major step forward.\nThe company demonstrates its commitment to cutting-edge technology by allowing developers to launch and handle creative AI and full-stack apps safely.\nAlso, Snowflake\u2019s creation of a unique Large Language Model, which came about when it bought Applica, is a big deal. It makes it easier to get ideas from unorganized data, so you don\u2019t need to know a lot about machine learning. Snowflake\u2019s goal of making technology easy to use and life-changing fits with Apple\u2019s philosophy of making technology available to everyone. Basically, Snowflake isn\u2019t just getting better; it\u2019s changing the way businesses use data, which makes it the next big thing in the tech world.\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Author": " Pras Subramanian    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) reportedly will not go ahead with plans to build a car after spending billions of dollars and nearly a decade on it. But in the end some analysts say it\u2019s likely a good thing for the tech juggernaut.\n\u201cA successful and profitable company such as Apple has little to gain from building their own vehicle,\u201d said Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions, a research firm specializing in the automotive manufacturing sector. \"The minefields currently being traversed by the likes of Rivian and Lucid should have informed executives at Apple just how difficult an endeavor this would have been.\u201d\nIn recent months it seems Apple executives did come to this conclusion. According to Bloomberg,\u00a0after pushing out deadlines and features set for the car recently, it became more obvious that building a car from the bottom up was going to be expensive. At the same time, the car would be entering a market already saturated with EV competition with the likes of Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid at the higher end \u2014 and one where demand was softening substantially. Even Big Three automakers like Ford and GM have warned about waning EV demand in their Q4 earnings statements.\n\u201cSince Apple farms out much of its product manufacturing to other firms, it was unlikely that any vehicle they developed would have been assembled in-house, however marketing such a vehicle would have required something more than Geniuses at the mall Apple Store,\u201d Fiorani said, highlighting the challenges Apple faced in the market.\nAnd unlike other EV makers, Apple wouldn't be able to capitalize on its data, since it already gets so much of it through its ubiquitous iPhones.\n\u201cNew vehicle startups of the last two decades have focused their long-term energy on data, which is Apple\u2019s core business today,\u201d Fiorani said, referring to Rivian and Lucid. \u201cThe iPhone already gathers so much information on its owners that the cost to start a vehicle division couldn\u2019t possibly pay off in enough additional data to offset the financial risk.\u201d\nApple has before dabbled in product areas outside of its core and then dropped plans if they proved unlikely to be profitable. For years Apple was rumored to be making its own high-end flat screen TV for consumers. But as the market for LCD and LED TVs became less profitable, Apple withdrew those efforts and stuck to making external monitors.\nThe better play for Apple's foray into autos, as many analysts have noted, is sticking with software and helping legacy automakers create a better user experience for their customers. With Apple CarPlay software for vehicles, Apple could add value by focusing on Apple\u2019s core competencies like design and user interaction and enjoy higher and more stable profit margins.\n\u201cToday\u2019s software-driven vehicles need engineers, like those at Apple, to create a system to gather, process, harness, and utilize data from drivers, passengers, and the vehicles themselves,\u201d Fiorani added. \u201cThis is a bigger potential windfall than the actual development of a vehicle.\u201d\nWall Street reaction from analysts at firms including Morgan Stanley, CFRA, and Wedbush Securities has been universally positive on Apple's cancellation of its car project, though they acknowledged that the costs incurred are not ideal. Nevertheless Apple\u2019s pivot from a car to other endeavors like generative AI are welcome.\n\u201cAs Apple Car bears, we believe this report, if true, represents a positive step forward in 1) focusing on what matters, and 2) exhibiting cost discipline,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe believe the engineering talent, CAPEX investments, and time spent on Project Titan are better repurposed into related technologies, such as Generative AI, which has a much higher probability of coming to market and strengthening Apple's competitive moat\u2026 Any new talent that can help further Apple's AI progress is a net positive, in our view.\u201d\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most influential companies in history.\nThe iPhone heralded the era of the mobile internet, and now, the Vision Pro may kick off the next major computing platform. Most of the credit for the company's success is usually given to co-founder and longtime CEO Steve Jobs. He led Apple through its most inventive period when it released the iPod, iPhone, and iPad in less than a decade, setting the stock on an incredible growth path that's lasted to this day.\nCurrent CEO Tim Cook took the helm in Aug. 2011, shortly before Jobs' death. Cook had previously served as Chief Operating Officer, running the company's sales operation and supply chain. While some were skeptical that Cook could fill Jobs' shoes, he's skillfully led Apple and its stock to new heights. Here's how the company has fared during his tenure.\nIn 2011, the tech industry was much smaller than it is today. Smartphones were still relatively new, and the mobile economy was just developing.\nTrue to expectations, Apple's pace of innovation has slowed under Cook. Prior to the release of the Vision Pro earlier this month, the biggest products launched under his tenure have been accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods.\nCook's biggest accomplishments have likely been the growth of the company's installed base of devices, which reached 2.2 billion in its most recent quarter, and the growth of the services business. Services generate significantly higher margins than Apple's devices, and annual services revenue exploded from $12.9 billion in fiscal 2012 to $85.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Revenue from this segment is largely driven by the App Store, or the 30% commission Apple takes on in-app payments, as well as offerings like Apple Pay and Apple Care insurance.\nThese achievements have largely been incremental: Improving each iteration of the iPhone enough to keep customers coming back for an upgrade, helping to grow the services business, and selling complementary devices like Apple Watches and Airpods.\nHowever, 2024 has set the stage for arguably the biggest risk the company has taken under Cook: the release of the Vision Pro. Though reviews have been mixed, most industry observers believe that if any company can crack the headset market, it's Apple.\nAs most investors know, Apple has been a big winner in the Cook era.\nAs you can see, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin since Cook took over in Aug. 2011 -- up 1,270% (or 1,530% on a total return basis). That means an investor who bought $10,000 of Apple stock at the start of Cook's tenure would have $163,000 today after enjoying a compound annual return of 25%. An equal investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $52,100 today.\nApple held the title of the world's most valuable company for most of the past several years, but it recently lost the crown to longtime rival Microsoft. Nonetheless, Apple is still in good shape to deliver solid profit growth as it grows services revenue, repurchases stock, and refreshes its device lineup.\nThe company dominates the consumer tech industry, and it's grown its share of the smartphone market in recent years.\nWhile the stock commands premium to the broad market with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, Apple has proven itself time and again, and its core businesses look as strong as ever. Cook teased a generative AI announcement for later this year, which could be transformative for the company. And the Vision Pro, if successful, could reshape Cook's legacy as an innovator.\nMaintaining a pace of 25% average annual returns might be difficult, but the company is still well-positioned to outperform the market for the foreseeable future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Thanks to its lineup of incredibly popular hardware products, and its budding services and software offerings, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most valuable businesses on the face of the planet. Its expertise and dominant success in the consumer-focused tech world could be beneficial when it comes to potential acquisitions.\nConsider Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON). This once-thriving exercise equipment and app enterprise has experienced falling demand and ongoing net losses. Maybe its turnaround plans could get a boost with some help.\nWith its massive financial resources, is there a possibility the iPhone maker will go out and buy the struggling fitness company? Here are two important things that investors should know about the ongoing rumors of this deal.\nApple specializes in developing beautiful hardware differentiated by its own proprietary software, which is exactly what Peloton does. The difference is that Apple has maintained lasting success in a profitable manner, thanks to an emphasis on its innovative culture, brand strength, and pricing power. Peloton wants to be just like this.\nWith the Watch and Fitness+, Apple already has a presence in the health space. CEO Tim Cook said in 2019 that Apple's greatest contribution to humanity \"will be about health.\" The overarching goal to improve people's lives is something Peloton shares with Apple.\nThis deal might make sense strategically. Apple already has over 2 billion active devices. Adding exercise equipment into high-income households would provide another avenue to collect data, and there are neat ways the two companies could find ways to integrate.\nFor example, Apple Music could provide all the music for Peloton's massive workout catalog. And through Apple Card, Apple could provide certain rewards or incentives to buy a piece of Peloton's hardware.\nApple also has the financial resources to buy Peloton with cash. In fiscal 2023, the tech enterprise produced $100 billion of free cash flow. There is more than enough cash in its coffers.\nNow that we've looked at all the compelling reasons that demonstrate why Apple would be a no-brainer buyer for Peloton, let's consider why I don't see this deal happening anytime soon.\nFor starters, Apple isn't known for a corporate strategy that favors sizable acquisitions. Its largest purchase occurred in 2014 when it bought Beats for $3 billion. At a meaningful premium to Peloton's current market cap of $2.1 billion, a possible takeover would still be in the ballpark as one of Apple's biggest. I don't know if management is trying to do this.\nApple generated $383 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30). In its fiscal 2023 (ended June 30), Peloton registered sales of $2.8 billion. Even if the exercise company saw its revenue surge under Apple, it still might simply be too small an opportunity.\nOn the one hand, if this deal did happen, but ended up not working out, the purchase price would be a rounding error for Apple, and shareholders would likely shrug it off. At least executives would have tried something that made strategic sense, but just wasn't in the cards.\nBut let's say this transaction became a reality, and Peloton was successfully integrated into Apple's operations, with a return to growth and profitability for the fitness business. It still wouldn't move the needle for the tech giant.\nApple basically has the entire global population as its addressable market. Those who are interested in spending a four-figure sum to buy exercise equipment are a tiny fraction of this. Nonetheless, should this deal ever be on the table, it would undoubtedly benefit Peloton much more than Apple.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Apple's scrapped car project means AI and headset bets are more urgent",
        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 In abandoning plans for a self-driving car, Apple Inc. is giving up on billions in potential revenue and the dream of selling what one executive called \u201cthe ultimate mobile device.\u201d The hope is that other big bets \u2014 including generative AI and mixed-reality headsets \u2014 can make up the difference.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey\nHow Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World\nOffice Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers\nA Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists\nNvidia\u2019s $70 Million Florida Supercomputer Hobbled by DeSantis Law\nApple reached this crossroads Tuesday, when it told employees it was winding down the car project and reassigned some of the staff to its AI efforts. The decision followed months of frenzied meetings between top executives and the company\u2019s board over how to proceed. Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and project head Kevin Lynch broke the news to the roughly 2,000-member team during a meeting that lasted less than 15 minutes.\nThe upshot: Apple\u2019s future isn\u2019t going to hinge on selling $100,000 cars with self-driving features. Instead, it will focus on catching up with rivals in the generative AI industry, where chatbots from OpenAI and Google have captured the imagination of consumers and investors. The shift also lets Apple concentrate on turning the Vision Pro headset \u2014 still a fledgling product \u2014 into a mainstream hit.\nInvestors and analysts applauded the move, which lets Apple avoid an electric-vehicle market that\u2019s grown more perilous in recent months. Shifting resources toward generative AI is the right call \u201cgiven the long-term profitability potential of AI revenue streams versus cars,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard said.\nBut the decision also eliminates a future revenue source at a time when Apple has been struggling to maintain growth. Though the company managed to pull out of a sales slump last quarter, it warned that the current period will be sluggish again. The Vision Pro just launched this month and isn\u2019t expected to be a major contributor to growth for years, if ever.\nWith a car, profit margins would have been slim but the revenue potential was massive. The idea was long touted as one of Apple\u2019s famous \u201cnext big things\u201d and could have more firmly locked consumers into the company\u2019s ecosystem. Tesla Inc., which led the EV revolution in the US, generated nearly $100 billion in revenue last year. Furthermore, tech giants like Alphabet Inc. and Chinese rivals remain focused on cars.\nApple\u2019s decadelong car effort, known as Project Titan, also was an AI challenge in itself. Apple attempted to build an artificial intelligence system that was powerful and energy-efficient enough to make a car fully autonomous.\nWith that off the table, Apple can concentrate on applying AI to its current products, including the iPhone and iPad, and avoid falling further behind tech peers like Alphabet\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\nApple is planning to reveal new AI capabilities, including more automated tools for software development and features for summarizing news articles, at its conference for developers in June. The first new features are planned for iOS 18, which will be released around September alongside the next iPhones, Bloomberg News has reported.\nRead More: Apple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot\nThose efforts now have fresh recruits, thanks to the winding down of the car endeavor \u2014 known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG. The company will relocate about a third of the vehicle team to other divisions.\nMeanwhile, hundreds of people working on autonomous driving hardware, car interiors and exteriors, and vehicle electronics will need to seek new jobs inside the company. If they can\u2019t find roles, they\u2019ll be laid off. And some employees have already been informed that they\u2019ll be heading for the exits.\nThree main groups within SPG \u2014 a software team based in Ottawa under executive Dan Dodge; a cloud engineering and software group under Libo Meyers; and a software project management team under Vera Carr \u2014 will be shifted to Craig Federighi\u2019s software department to work on Apple\u2019s main operating systems.\nApple\u2019s artificial intelligence team for the car, which had been reporting to Stuart Bowers, will be shifted to work on generative AI in John Giannandrea\u2019s machine learning division. Some of the car talent could also apply their skills to the Vision Pro. That product has many features, including the ability to create a virtual representation of its wearer, that rely on artificial intelligence.\nThe big question is how soon AI might make serious money for Apple. It\u2019s unlikely that the company will have a full-scale AI lineup of applications and features for a few years. And Apple\u2019s penchant for user privacy could make it challenging to compete aggressively in the market.\nFor now, Apple will continue to make most of its money from hardware. The iPhone alone accounts for about half its revenue. So AI\u2019s biggest potential in the near term will be its ability to sell iPhones, iPads and other devices.\nAs for the Vision Pro, which melds virtual and augmented reality, that too is years away from being a major moneymaker. The immersive technology has thrilled some early adopters, but the first version of the device remains too cumbersome and costly. Even if it sells a few million units a year, the $3,500 headset will only be a small percentage of Apple\u2019s nearly $400 billion annual revenue total.\nThe company is exploring other big ideas, including lighter-weight AR glasses, new smart-home devices and AirPods with cameras. But it will take years to tell whether a range of smaller products can replace what would have been Apple\u2019s biggest: a car.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations\nHong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen\nThere\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great\nTranscript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Who needs an expensive, low-margin electric vehicle when you have ambiguous hopes for AI?\nAfter an ill-fated, decade-long odyssey, Apple has said goodbye to its car project and will redirect resources to its artificial intelligence division. A blow to all who longed to see exactly which generation Fiat 500 Jony Ive would have paid homage to.\nIf the decision was an admission of defeat \u2014 Elon Musk responded to the news on X with an emoji of a salute and a cigarette \u2014 it didn't feel like one. The collective response from several analysts and the market was something close to \"good riddance.\"\nScuttling the multibillion-dollar insurgent effort will allow Cupertino to focus on a broad AI strategy within the Apple ecosystem, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\nOthers have pointed to the way Apple's software and intuitive design have already reshaped the car industry through CarPlay, software that connects iPhones to cars, effectively transforming other companies' hardware into extensions of its walled garden.\nAnd leaving the automotive ambitions in the software realm means never having a 3,000-pound dented, muddy, and \u2014 most of all \u2014 rusty product sullying the world's cleanest brand on the road. Or on a lawn. As long as the updates keep coming it will be forever new.\nApple took so long to walk away from the expensive gamble that the tardiness looks like timeliness. New entrants have upped the competition in the electric vehicle market, sparking price wars and squeezing margins.\nEven Tesla, the EV king whose anti-Detroit rebellion inspired Apple's vehicular ambitions, has hit roadblocks. Slowing demand projected in 2024 has darkened the company's outlook. And without Big Tech's sprawling operations that span multiple sectors, Tesla has fewer business lines to rely on. The stock is down nearly 20% so far this year. As improbable as Tesla\u2019s rise has been, its long-term success still hinges on largely unproven autonomous technology.\nThe astonishing growth of Magnificent Seven winners, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft (MSFT), further presses the question of why Apple would chase Tesla when the early days of developing AI tools have been so promising.\nMusk's recent fuss over unlocking Tesla's AI potential makes Apple's car exit even more compelling. CEO Tim Cook already has multiple conduits for intimate data gathering and platforms for refining AI tools. Musk's vehicles are parked outside; Cook's screens tuck you in at night.\nBut there's something too on the nose and a little bleak about the world's most valuable company shuffling staff from its daring EV project to the trend of the moment, pursuing a more dazzling version of ChatGPT, or finding immersive ways to sink users more deeply into their couch. You'd think the phrase \"If you can't beat em, join em\" shouldn't apply to an enterprise packing hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at a problem.\nAt the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Cook said Apple will share details of its new AI features later this year. It's still not clear how AI will resuscitate Apple's growth story. But at least now we know where it won't come from.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": "  Caleb Naysmith ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. is constantly looking for new and innovative ways to spend its $73 billion war chest. From the Vision Pro to the Apple Car, it's rolling out new products and producing the next generation of consumer technology. Last week, it was reported that its decade-long Apple Car project is coming to an end. But it looks like the trillion-dollar titan has a new focus: artificial intelligence.\nIn a bold move toward integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its ecosystem, Apple is setting the stage to unveil a series of generative AI-based tools at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. This initiative, part of iOS 18, signifies a significant leap in Apple\u2019s AI strategy, showcasing a new version of Siri enhanced with generative AI capabilities. The upgrade promises a range of new functionalities, aiming to revolutionize user interactions with Apple devices\u200b\u200b.\nDon't Miss:\nThis startup coined \u201ceBay for gamers\u201d with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\nThis $0.25 per share Boston startup is fixing a glaring problem with today's online advertising and is currently crowdfunding.\nApple\u2019s AI ambitions extend beyond Siri. The company is reportedly planning to introduce an AI-based tool for completing lines of software code, akin to Microsoft Corp.\u2018s Copilot. Microsoft continues to be a magnate in the AI space. It has invested billions in OpenAI in a profit-sharing agreement that has also helped power the company's suite of AI-based tools.\nThis tool, expected to be integrated into Apple\u2019s Xcode software, could simplify the development process by automatically completing code blocks, potentially transforming how developers work on the Apple platform. In addition to code completion, Apple is exploring AI features for automating Apple Music playlists and enhancing its business presentation software. These advancements indicate Apple\u2019s broader goal to infuse AI across its product range, enhancing user experience and productivity\u200b\u200b.\nTrending: Peter Thiel, Mark Cuban and Warren Buffett funded early-stage startups and made millions. You don't need to be a well-connected billionaire to do the same.\nApple\u2019s approach to AI development is characterized by strategic partnerships and technological innovation. The company has been in talks with major publishers for rights to train its generative AI systems using their content, aiming for multiyear agreements. This step underscores Apple\u2019s commitment to refining its AI capabilities through access to vast data sets, ensuring that its AI tools are both powerful and informed by a wide range of information sources\u200b\u200b.\nA technical breakthrough has also been reported, with Apple AI researchers developing a method to deploy large language models (LLMs) on iPhones and other devices with limited memory. This innovation could bring sophisticated AI functionalities directly into the pockets of millions of users, overcoming previous constraints related to device capabilities. Such advancements highlight Apple\u2019s focus on not just integrating AI into its devices but doing so in a way that is accessible and seamless for everyday use\u200b\u200b.\nAs Apple gears up for these AI-driven enhancements, the anticipation grows not only among its user base but also within the broader tech community. The upcoming WWDC is poised to be a landmark event, potentially setting new standards for AI integration in consumer technology. Apple\u2019s strategic investments in AI research and development, coupled with its efforts to ensure ethical and responsible use of AI, reflect a vision that extends beyond mere technological leadership. The company aims to redefine the intersection of AI and user experience, promising a future where Apple devices are not just tools but intelligent companions in the digital age.\nRead Next:\nOne startup funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and Homeland Security aims to solve this specific nuisance in a spectacular fashion, and you can invest in it today.\nFortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Apple's Launching A Futuristic Siri And Apple-Based Artificial Intelligence As It Looks To Take On Microsoft's AI Dominance originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook called out the company\u2019s AI investments on Thursday, adding that the tech giant will show off the fruits of those moves in the year ahead.\nThe comment, which Cook made during Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings call, is the clearest signal yet that the company doesn\u2019t want to be perceived as missing out on Wall Street\u2019s favorite tech trend.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,\u201d Cook said during the call.\n\"I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with gen. AI and AI,\" he later added in response to an analyst's question.\nApple has been comparatively silent on generative AI save for a few sparing responses to analysts during the company\u2019s earnings calls. All the while, Apple\u2019s Big Tech rivals, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), have continued to push out a variety of generative AI products.\nInstead, Apple has largely focused on announcements related to machine learning improvements to the company\u2019s iOS operating system in the form of features like updated autocorrect for the keyboard.\nWhile Apple hasn\u2019t jumped on the generative AI train like its brethren, the company has been working in the space for some time. The iPhone and Macs running on its M-series chips featured built-in neural engines long before the PC market, which only began boasting about AI PCs during CES last month.\nBut without a clear callout to the AI craze, Apple appeared to be behind the curve.\nAnalysts, meanwhile, have been hoping Apple would roll out some kind of AI product in 2024 as part of either an iOS update or alongside the iPhone 16. And while Cook didn\u2019t specify when or how we would see the company\u2019s AI investments show up, it\u2019s a safe bet its most important device and operating system stand to benefit.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple began testing its own ChatGPT-style bot last year and is working to develop a version of Siri with generative AI functionality. AI, he says, will also find its way across iOS 18.\nCook\u2019s reveal comes as Apple is launching its most ambitious product in years: the Vision Pro. A \u201cspatial computer,\u201d the headset, which starts at $3,499, will serve as a new computing platform for the company.\nBut the device\u2019s sky-high price tag could hamper sales among average consumers, who could balk at spending so much on a completely new product category.\nDuring the earnings call, Cook said Apple is seeing a good amount of interest in the Vision Pro from enterprise customers, including demos that take advantage of the headset\u2019s capabilities.\nOutside of that, Cook said that iPhone sales measured in constant currency in mainland China were only down single digits. The comment, which Cook made in response to an analyst question, comes as Apple saw Greater China revenue fall to $20.8 billion in the first quarter this year from $23.9 billion in Q1 2023.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Analyst Estimates: Here's What Brokers Think Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) After Its First-Quarter Report",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "As you might know, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently reported its quarterly numbers. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$120b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Apple surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$2.18 per share, modestly greater than expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n Check out our latest analysis for Apple \nFollowing last week's earnings report, Apple's 43 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$388.3b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$6.55, approximately in line with the last 12 months. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$396.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.57 in 2024. The consensus seems maybe a little more pessimistic, trimming their revenue forecasts after the latest results even though there was no change to its EPS estimates.\nThe consensus has reconfirmed its price target of US$200, showing that the analysts don't expect weaker revenue expectations next year to have a material impact on Apple's market value. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Apple, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$250 and the most bearish at US$125 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Apple's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 0.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 10% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 4.7% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Apple is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. Even so, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at US$200, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

        "Title": "Apple\u2019s Vision Pro lands as the company faces threats from all sides",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Vision Pro officially hit the market on Friday, marking the most significant product launch for the company since the Apple Watch back in 2015. But the enthusiasm for the company\u2019s most ambitious product in years was tempered on Wall Street after Apple reported a slowdown in China sales during its fiscal first quarter.\nThe Vision Pro is, as Apple calls it, a spatial computer. But for the average person, it\u2019s a high-powered AR/VR headset.\nI originally used the Vision Pro after Apple debuted it during its WWDC event in June 2023, and again just before its Feb. 2 launch. And yes, it\u2019s every bit as impressive as you\u2019ve heard.\nBut a lot is riding on the Vision Pro\u2019s long-term success as Apple looks for its next major product platform. And with storm clouds swirling above Apple\u2019s Cupertino headquarters, the company needs a win more than ever.\nApple has been dealing with an array of difficulties throughout the first few weeks of the year, and it\u2019s not looking any brighter going into February. But the most pressing issue the company is facing at the moment is a slowdown in sales in Greater China.\nApple\u2019s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, China has been a key catalyst in Apple\u2019s growth story over the years as the country\u2019s expanding middle class and a surge in smartphone sales provided fertile ground for the iPhone\u2019s popularity to take off in the region.\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, Apple was still the bestselling smartphone brand in China in Q4 2023, capturing 20% of the market compared to local rivals Xiaomi, Huawei, and Honor, which took 16%, 15.2%, and 15.1%, respectively. But Huawei saw its year-over-year market share jump 71.1% from the year prior thanks to its new 5G smartphones, while Apple\u2019s fell 9%.\nThat, coupled with China\u2019s lumbering economy, meant that Apple\u2019s overall Greater China revenue declined from $23.9 billion in Q4 2022 to $20.8 billion in Q4 2023.\nAccording to UBS analyst David Vogt, if Apple\u2019s market share decline is permanent and the smartphone market grows a predicted 3% in 2024, \u201clost share in China could pressure iPhone revenue by slightly more than $7B, a 3.5% iPhone revenue headwind and ~1.9% total company headwind.\u201d\nApple also finds itself in a tangle of regulatory problems in the European Union as it works to navigate the bloc\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA). Set to go into effect this year, the DMA ensures large tech companies don\u2019t have too much power over the broader tech ecosystem. So far, Apple has announced that it will open up its platform, allowing users in the region to install third-party app stores and giving app developers the option to offer users third-party payment options beyond Apple\u2019s in-app payment system.\nBut there\u2019s a catch. If developers decide to use outside payment options, they\u2019ll still have to fork over cash to Apple. The tech giant, however, says the charge, which amounts to a 50 euro cent fee, only applies to developers whose apps are downloaded more than 1 million times in a year. After that they\u2019ll need to pay that charge for each subsequent download.\nCritics, including Spotify CEO Daniel Ek and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, have struck back at Apple with Ek calling the new rule \u201chostile\u201d and Sweeney saying it\u2019s a \u201cdevious new instance of Malicious Compliance.\u201d The EU still has to determine if Apple\u2019s new rules comply with the DMA.\nIn the US, meanwhile, Apple is staring down a potential Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. According to the New York Times, the DOJ is looking into how Apple controls its hardware and software as a means of keeping consumers locked into its ecosystem and fighting off competitors. While any lawsuit could potentially take years to wind its way through the legal system it could distract the company at a time when it\u2019s seeking to push into a new product category.\nThe Vision Pro serves as Apple\u2019s next-generation computing platform. At $3,499 it\u2019s not exactly priced to move for the typical consumer, but that doesn\u2019t minimize its importance for the company.\nAfter years of development, the headset can\u2019t fail. And while I\u2019ve only been able to use it briefly across two separate roughly 30-minute sessions, it\u2019s hard to imagine a competitor matching what Apple has to offer anytime soon.\nThe display is the sharpest I\u2019ve seen on an AR/VR headset, the fit is comfortable, and the interface is incredibly easy to navigate. Apple boasts an enormous library of apps for the Vision Pro, though there are notable big names missing, including Netflix and YouTube.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that the Vision Pro is powered by an external battery that Apple says gets two hours of battery life, which could be a turnoff for some users.\nI\u2019ll dive deeper into what it\u2019s like to use the Vision Pro when I get my hands on one for an extended period, but it\u2019s safe to say Apple has created an incredible piece of technology. Now it needs to sell the general public on it.\nJust add that to the list of challenges the company will have to overcome in the year ahead.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-02-19, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.47. It's currently trading at a price of $182.31. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -17.26%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.42\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.28%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n83.3\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n72.17\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n155.47\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $143.19. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -27.32%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Earnings season has arrived, providing fresh batches of figures to consider when expanding your portfolio.\nTwo of the major companies releasing results last week were Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Both have built immense brand loyalty with consumers and boast powerful positions in retail. Apple has almost unrivaled supremacy in consumer tech products. Amazon has similar dominance in e-commerce and the cloud market.\nSince 2019, Apple has soared by 349% and Amazon by 96%. While past growth is no guarantee of what's to come, these companies have solid long-term outlooks as they continue to expand in their respective industries. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon both beat Wall Street forecasts for earnings per share\u00a0 and revenue in their most recent quarters.\nBut is Apple or Amazon the better stock to buy right now?\nApple is coming out of a tricky year. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30, 2023), and revenue dipped by 3%. However, the results from its fiscal 2024 first quarter (which ended Dec. 31, 2023) showed signs that a recovery could be underway.\nDuring the quarter, Apple's net sales rose 2% year over year to $120 billion, beating analysts' expectations by more than $1 billion and breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Meanwhile, its earnings hit $2.18 per share compared to an expected $2.10 per share.\nYet, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business. Smartphone sales increased 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. That country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening sales in one of Apple's most crucial markets. China accounts for about 17% of its product sales.\nAs a result, Apple's stock fell nearly 4% in after-hours trading following its earnings release on Feb. 1.\nHowever, recent challenges are why keeping a long-term perspective with proven growth stocks like Apple is crucial. The company has a highly lucrative digital services business and is investing heavily in expanding markets like artificial intelligence (AI).\nAdditionally, the tech firm hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow last year. It has the funds to overcome current headwinds and continue investing in its business.\nWall Street seemed to have the opposite reaction to Amazon's earnings release. The e-commerce giant's shares rose by nearly 10% after it posted its Q4 2023 results on Feb. 1.\nDuring the quarter, Amazon's revenue grew 14% year over year to $170 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast by close to $4 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings per share came to $1, compared to an expected $0.80.\nMuch of Amazon's stellar growth came from its e-commerce business. Its North American segment posted operating income exceeding $6 billion, significantly improving on the $240 million in losses reported in the year-ago quarter.\nAmazon's Q4 was a fitting end to a stellar year of growth. After suffering steep declines in 2022 as spikes in inflation curbed consumer discretionary spending, the company pulled off an impressive turnaround.\nAs a result, Amazon's stock is up 63% year over year, compared to a 28% rise in Apple's share price. During the same period, Amazon's free cash flow soared by 427% to $17 billion. Apple's total free cash flow is higher, but declined by just over 1% over the last 12 months.\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory, with solid retail growth and a highly profitable cloud business.\nComparing these firms' forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/E), Apple's 28 against Amazon's 48 makes the iPhone company's stock look like a far better value. Forward P/E is a valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's share price by its estimated future earnings per share. The lower the figure, generally, the better the value.\nHowever, the chart below shows their valuations are more complex than that.\nThis chart shows Apple's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share over the next two fiscal years, and Amazon's might reach just under $7 per share. Multiplying these figures by the companies' forward P/E ratios yields stock prices of $218 for Apple and $317 for Amazon.\nBased on their current positions, these projections would see Apple's stock price rise 17% by fiscal 2026, while Amazon shares would increase by 84%.\nAs a result, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer in a decision between these two companies. The tech giant is on a growth path too good to ignore, making it the better stock to buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The tech giant reported a modest revenue increase to $119.6 billion, up 2% from the same quarter last year. Notably, earnings per diluted share surged by 16% to a new all-time high of $2.18.\nApple, a leading innovator in personal technology, continues to dominate with its suite of products and services. With the iPhone as its flagship product, Apple has built an expansive ecosystem that includes the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, all complemented by a growing range of services like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. The company's commitment to innovation is evident in its latest offering, the Apple Vision Pro, which CEO Tim Cook suggests will continue Apple's tradition of groundbreaking advancements.\nApple's financial achievements this quarter reflect the company's robust business model and its ability to grow its services segment to new heights. The increase in services revenue to $23.1 billion underscores the company's successful diversification beyond hardware sales. However, the modest growth in overall revenue indicates potential challenges in expanding its market share and finding new revenue streams, especially in a competitive and rapidly changing technology landscape.\nApple's income statement reveals a gross margin increase to $54.9 billion, up from $50.3 billion in the previous year, indicating improved profitability. Operating expenses saw a slight rise, but the company managed to expand its operating income to $40.4 billion. The balance sheet shows a healthy cash and cash equivalents position of $40.8 billion, an increase from $29.9 billion at the end of the previous quarter, which demonstrates Apple's strong liquidity position.\n\"Our December quarter top-line performance combined with margin expansion drove an all-time record EPS of $2.18, up 16 percent from last year,\" said Luca Maestri, Apples CFO. \"During the quarter, we generated nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow, and returned almost $27 billion to our shareholders. We are confident in our future, and continue to make significant investments across our business to support our long-term growth plans.\"\nApple's financial tables highlight key data points:\nFinancial Metrics\nQ1 2024\nQ1 2023\nNet Sales (Products)\n$96.5 billion\n$96.4 billion\nNet Sales (Services)\n$23.1 billion\n$20.8 billion\nTotal Net Sales\n$119.6 billion\n$117.2 billion\nGross Margin\n$54.9 billion\n$50.3 billion\nNet Income\n$33.9 billion\n$30.0 billion\nApple's performance this quarter demonstrates its ability to maintain profitability and reward shareholders amidst global economic uncertainties. The significant increase in EPS is a testament to the company's operational efficiency and cost management. The growth in the services sector is particularly noteworthy, as it represents Apple's strategic shift towards less hardware-dependent revenue streams. However, the relatively flat product sales suggest that Apple may need to continue innovating and diversifying its product line to sustain growth in the highly competitive tech market.\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a formidable player in the technology sector, with a strong financial foundation and a clear strategic direction aimed at long-term growth. Investors and stakeholders can take confidence in Apple's consistent performance and its ability to adapt to market changes.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Apple Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Chris MacDonald ",
        "Text": "Any Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock forecast has to recognize how critical the iPhone has been, but, as the company\u2019s management team has proven, the company is far more than that. From its cloud business to its services and accessories (among other hardware devices), Apple is an absolute behemoth in the consumer discretionary sector.\nFluctuating between the world\u2019s largest and second-largest company regularly, Apple keeps its power in the markets and remains a core portfolio holding of many passive investors (whether or not they know it). In fact, the market weighting for Apple remains at or near a market-leading level, for good reason. Let\u2019s dive into why the company should be considered a core holding by active and passive investors alike.\nAfter Apple\u2019s recent earnings report, 43 analysts projected the company\u2019s 2024 revenue to come in at $388.3 billion, similar to the previous 12 months. Predicted earnings per share stood at $6.55, also consistent with last year\u2019s results.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nThese were down from previous estimates, but the market has remained steadfast with its view that cash flow growth should remain robust at this mega-cap giant. For many, that\u2019s enough of a reason to own this company at over 30-times earnings.\nAnalysts reaffirmed Apple\u2019s consensus price target at $200, indicating they don\u2019t expect lower revenue forecasts to affect its market worth. Now varied estimates resulted in this consensus estimate. These analyst price targets range from a bullish $250 to a bearish $125 per share, showcasing diverse perspectives on Apple\u2019s future.\nAside from its gadgets, Apple also has a very strong services segment. The segment boasts $23.1 billion in revenue, and it has been helping drive the company\u2019s to success. Because of its innovation, the stock surged about 23% in 2023 and is expecting to grow more in 2024.\nWedbush analysts hailed Apple\u2019s Vision Pro as a potential \u201cgame changer\u201d post its store debut. They noted its early mass appeal and strong initial reception, surpassing expectations and foreseeing future integration with AI.\nApple\u2019s Vision Pro entered the competition against Meta\u2019s Quest 3, the leading AR headset in 2023. Despite its higher price starting at $3,499 compared to Quest 3\u2019s $500, analysts viewed it as a valuable asset for Apple.\nBank of America estimated it could contribute 68-89 cents per share to Apple\u2019s EPS over five years. They also foresee a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by generative AI.\nIn the recent earnings call CEO Tim Cook also highlighted some adjustments to Apple\u2019s iOS, Safari, Apple Pay, and App Store that aligns with EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA).\nHe emphasized Apple\u2019s commitment to privacy, security, and usability, despite potential limitations due to regulatory compliance. Apple\u2019s CFO Luca Maestri clarified these changes would affect only EU users, constituting approximately 7% of the global App Store revenue.\nIn the fourth quarter, Cook highlighted robust growth in emerging markets, including record-breaking sales in Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, and strong performance in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile.\nDespite declining sales in China, where\u00a0Apple remains strong, this company is a top global smartphone seller, and will likely continue to be for years to come.\nApple is a company that is really unparalleled in the world of financial markets right now. The company\u2019s recent product innovations, its pursuit of more ecosystem-driven services revenue, and its rock-solid balance sheet make this stock one to hold for the long-term.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is canceling a decadelong effort to build an electric car, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Warns of Big Losses From Asset Sales During Property Slump\nNYCB Flags Weaknesses in Loan Oversight and Names New CEO\nElon Musk Sues OpenAI and Altman for Breaching Firm\u2019s Founding Mission\nBankers Sick of the NYC Commute Are Fueling a Boom in a Mini Greenwich\nApple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn\u2019t public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.\nThe two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the car team \u2014 known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG \u2014 will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.\nListen to the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the Bloomberg Terminal. Read the transcript.\nThe Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and vehicle designers. It\u2019s possible they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it\u2019s unclear how many.\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.\nThe move came as a relief to investors, who sent Apple shares climbing Tuesday after Bloomberg reported the news. The stock was up about 1% at $182.63 by the close in New York.\nElon Musk, head of Tesla Inc., also celebrated the move. He shared a post on the X social media site with a saluting emoji and a cigarette.\nThe decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort called Project Titan that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.\nBut the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team\u2019s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took charge of the undertaking a few years ago \u2014 following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.\nApple was still years away from producing a car and contemplated many different designs. Beyond the look of the vehicle, cracking self-driving technology was a major challenge. Apple had road-tested its system since 2017 using a Lexus SUV exterior, putting dozens of vehicles on roads in the US. The company also tested more secretive components on a gigantic track in Phoenix that was once owned by Chrysler.\nIn the end, Apple was facing a cooling market for EVs. Sales growth lost steam in recent months after high prices and a lack of charging infrastructure discouraged mainstream buyers from shifting to all-electric vehicles. General Motors Co. and Ford are pivoting to producing more hybrid vehicles after confronting lackluster EV demand and manufacturing bottlenecks, and automakers across the industry are slashing battery-electric car prices, production targets and profit forecasts.\nEven Tesla, the pioneer of the EV revolution in the US, has warned its rate of expansion will be \u201cnotably lower\u201d this year. Domestic EV sales growth will decelerate to 11% this year from an estimated 47% growth rate in 2023, according to a forecast by UBS AG.\nRead More: Electric Vehicle Sales Growth Is Slowing. Here\u2019s Why: QuickTake\nApple\u2019s most senior executives finalized the decision in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology. Apple had employees from across the car industry working on the project, including designers from Aston Martin, Lamborghini, BMW and Porsche.\nUnder the new arrangement, Lynch will report to Giannandrea. He previously reported to Williams, who also has overseen software engineering for the Apple Watch.\nApple once envisioned creating a car without a steering wheel and pedals, but it scrapped that notion earlier. The company also spent time working on a remote command center that could take over for a driver.\nMost recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company\u2019s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.\nApple continues to invest heavily in other areas. The company spent $113 billion on total research and development over the past five years, with an average annual growth rate of about 16%. The company also recently launched the Vision Pro headset \u2014 its first new product category in almost a decade \u2014 and has built up that business.\nThe company has scrapped projects before, including a plan to make a TV set that was abandoned around 2015. But few endeavors have lasted this long, involved so many employees or racked up billions of dollars in expenses.\nRead this next: Biden\u2019s EV Dreams Are a Nightmare for Tesla and the US Car Industry\nSo far, Apple\u2019s biggest push into the auto industry was its CarPlay software, which lets drivers access iPhone features like maps and Siri. It\u2019s being redesigned to integrate more deeply with vehicle controls and entertainment systems. By not competing with automakers, Apple could give a boost to that software, helping spread it to more models.\nUltimately, focusing on AI may be a better bet, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard said in a note. \u201cApple\u2019s decision to abandon electric cars and shift resources toward generative AI is a good strategic move, we believe, given the long-term profitability potential of AI revenue streams versus cars.\u201d\n--With assistance from Gabrielle Coppola.\n(A previous version of the story corrected the timing of an EV forecast.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors\nChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate\nChina\u2019s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation Into Monaco\u2019s Royal Family\nRobotics Startups Hope the AI Era Means Their Time Has Come\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis and Shivansh Tiwary\n(Reuters) -Apple has canceled work on its electric car, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday, a decade after the iPhone maker kicked off the project.\nThe move draws the curtain on a plan that would have helped Apple break out into a new industry and potentially replicate the success of the iPhone.\nThe project had seen uneven progress throughout its life and its end comes as global automakers cut back their investments in electric vehicles, whose demand has dropped significantly.\nSeveral employees working on the project will be shifted to the company's artificial intelligence (AI) division, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the development.\nApple declined to comment.\n\"If it is true, Apple will put more focus on GenAI and that should give investors more optimism about the company's efforts and ability to compete at a platform level on AI,\" said Ben Bajarin, CEO of consulting firm Creative Strategies.\nApple has so far held back from any big moves in AI, in stark contrast to tech giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft, which have first-mover advantage in incorporating the breakthrough technology.\nIts quiet approach has sparked worries the iPhone-maker could be behind in integrating the technology into its products.\nThat was reflected in Apple's share gain last year, which at nearly 50% was the smallest among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks.\nLast month, Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company as the iPhone maker grapples with weakness in demand for its key products, especially in major market China.\nMeanwhile, high interest rates have led to a slowdown in demand for usually pricier electric vehicles, prompting the industry to cut jobs and reduce production.\nSeveral major automakers, including EV market leader Tesla, have decided to pull back on investments, with some shifting plans to focus on hybrids instead of fully battery-powered cars.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk cheered Apple's move on X social media with a post of a saluting emoji and a cigarette.\nPROJECT TITAN\nApple kicked off Project Titan, as its car effort was known internally, a decade ago, as a wave of interest in self-driving vehicles swept through Silicon Valley.\nReuters reported in 2020 that Apple was considering releasing its proposed car soon as 2024 or 2025.\nBut progress had been bumpy even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global automotive industry. Apple had laid off 190 workers from the group in 2019 after revamping its software approach.\nThe design of the concept car also changed from a radical, steering-wheel-free autonomous vehicle that would have been a departure from traditional automotive design to a more conventional car with advanced driver-assistance features.\nNews of the project had initially raised hopes that Apple may replicate the success of the iPhone, whose fresh design and clean interface helped alter the handheld phone market.\nBut even iPhone sales, the main source of the company's revenue, has started seeing a growth slowdown as rivals launch handsets with matching specs and competitive prices.\nSales of iPad and Mac computers have also fallen amid broader slump in demand for expensive gadgets.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco, Harshita Mary Varghese and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai and Arun Koyyur)\n"

        "Text": "Apple stock (AAPL) sank in early trading Friday, despite the company posting better-than-expected earnings in its first quarter Thursday, as sales in one of its most important markets fell year over year.\nApple saw earnings per share of $2.18 on revenue of $119.6 billion in the prior quarter. Analysts were anticipating earnings of $2.11 on revenue of $117.9 billion.\nBut sales out of China, the company's third-largest region after North America and Europe, were lower than anticipated, topping out at just $20.8 billion. Wall Street was looking for sales of $23.5 billion. The company reported Greater China sales of $23.9 billion in the first quarter last year.\nThe company's stock fell more than 2% at the start of trading on Friday.\nApple is dealing with both a sluggish Chinese economy as well as a resurgent Huawei in the country, which has hurt sales in the region. But strong showings in both North American and Europe helped buoy the company.\nThe company reported iPhone sales of $69.7 billion, compared with expectations of $68.6 billion.\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.\u201d\nApple\u2019s Mac revenue topped out at $7.8 billion in the first quarter, missing analysts' expectations of $7.9 billion. The company's iPad revenue also missed at $7 billion; Wall Street was looking for $7.1 billion. That's a steep drop from the $9.4 billion the iPad business generated last year.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will introduce refreshed iPads and Macs in March, which could help goose sales numbers for both business segments in the year ahead.\nWearables, home, and accessories pulled in 12 billion, hitting estimates. Apple has been contending with an ongoing patent battle against medical device maker Masimo, which forced the company to temporarily take the device off of store shelves.\nIt has since removed the blood oxygen sensor component that triggered the dispute from its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches, but it\u2019s unclear how much of an impact that has had on sales.\nApple\u2019s Services segment, meanwhile, reached $23.1 billion, short of an anticipated $23.4 billion.\nApple\u2019s earnings come as the company prepares to launch its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. The device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, goes on sale Feb. 2 for $3,499. And while it\u2019s certainly an impressive product, its price tag will likely limit sales among most consumers.\nWhile Apple doesn\u2019t release exact device sales figures, CEO Cook said during the earnings call that Apple is seeing a good amount of interest in the Vision Pro from enterprise customers, including demos that take advantage of the headset's capabilities.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

In contrast, sales increased in Europe and Japan.\nThe company\u2019s earnings come just one day before Apple begins selling one of its riskiest new hardware releases in recent years: An augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro.\nOver the past five years, Apple has spent an estimated $100 billion in research and development on the device, which will cost $3,499 in the US, according to a recent analysis.\nIn a statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company\u2019s growth was fueled by iPhone sales and an all-time revenue record in the company\u2019s services division in the last three months of 2023.\n\u201cWe are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments,\u201d Cook said.\nNet iPhone sales grew from $65.7 billion one year ago to $69.7 billion in the last three months of 2023, but Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said that China\u2019s revenue numbers indicate demand for the device in the region is slowing \u201cmore than expected in the face of rising competition from local companies, including Huawei.\u201d\n\u201cThe big question is if this is just a blip, or signs of a bigger shift among consumers as rising interest rates and a weaker economic backdrop discourage consumers from making pricey purchases,\u201d Cohen said.\nCook addressed concerns about falling sales in China, saying, \u201cI remain very optimistic about China over the long term.\u201d\nOverall, Apple reported earnings per share of $2.18 for the quarter, a record for EPS for the company and higher than the $2.11 analysts had predicted.\nRevenue also beat analysts\u2019 expectations for the quarter at $119.6 billion.\nDespite beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines, Apple\u2019s stock dropped more than 3% after the market close.

        "Author": "  Dilantha De Silva ",
        "Text": "After disappointing investors in 2022, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered stellar returns in 2023 alongside the recovery of tech stocks. The company started 2024 on the right foot as well, handsomely beating Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter. Meta seems to be following in the footsteps of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is evident from its newfound interest in rewarding shareholders handsomely, not just with buybacks, but also with dividends. In a surprise move, the company announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, initiating a dividend program against all odds. The company also boosted its stock repurchase authorization by $50 billion to complement the dividend. Stellar fourth-quarter earnings coupled with the company's announcement of its first-ever dividend sent the stock 20% higher following the earnings report last week.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nA closer evaluation of Meta's prospects reveals it is well-positioned to grow from here and is still reasonably valued despite a meaningful expansion in valuation multiples in the last 12 months.\nFrom a high of 41% in 2019, Meta's operating margin reached a trough of 28.80% in 2022 with the company's aggressive investments in the metaverse failing to deliver the desired returns. Deteriorating operating margins forced the social media giant to take bold steps to improve its profitability in 2023, starting with the launch of a new campaign named Year of Efficiency. The company's operating margin ballooned to 36.30% in 2023 with it benefiting from several positive changes it implemented over the last 12 months. This is a positive sign as Meta is now moving forward as a more agile, leaner company that is capable of aggressively investing in artificial intelligence.\nMeta was among the many tech companies to focus on a lean business structure in 2023. The company ended the year with 67,317 employees compared to a total headcount of 86,482 in 2022. Despite a notable reduction in headcount, it performed exceptionally well across all of its business segments, including 16% year-over-year growth in revenue, 8% growth in family daily active people and a 28% increase in ad impressions. Meta's aggressive layoffs in the last 15 months have helped its operating performance, which is evident from the meaningful margin improvement reported for 2023.\nMeta's mass layoffs should not cloud the judgment of investors when it comes to evaluating its long-term prospects. Despite a focus on efficiency gains, the company has not lost its focus on strategic investments to ensure long-term growth.\nDuring the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company highlighted its commitment to deploying approximately 350,000 H100 chips to develop world-class computing infrastructure to penetrate the opportunities in the AI space. The massive computing power of the company will be used to improve Reels and develop AI capabilities to support the growth of Reels across Facebook and Instagram.\nThe company is also investing in custom silicon for specialized workloads to further accelerate the company's expansion as an AI-first social media giant. Last May, the company unveiled MTIA, Meta's first-generation AI inference accelerator, to handle content understanding, feeds and ads ranking more effectively.\nMeta's investments in AI will enable it to develop and deploy advanced AI services on its platforms in the future, potentially dealing a massive blow to its rivals who are still at the infant stages when it comes to deploying AI to improve ad performance and user retention.\nThe company is taking a long-term approach to AI development, spending millions of dollars every quarter on developing Llama models 5,6 and 7 to emerge as a leader in the generative AI space. These AI investments will directly impact revenue in several ways going forward.\nFirst, Meta is using AI to enhance its advertising platform. %he company has already launched Advantage+, a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving the return on investment of advertisers. This product suite allows advertisers to automate parts of the campaign creation process, including audience targeting, likely leading to efficiency gains. The company has also introduced text variation and image expansion features using generative AI to help marketers create high-quality advertisements to reach a global audience.\nSecond, Meta is leveraging AI to improve business messaging capabilities on WhatsApp Business. The company is testing AI-driven business support in chat to help business owners seamlessly conduct business through WhatsApp. According to management, click-to-message ads are continuing to grow and the potential integration of AI into business messaging should boost the revenue from this ad segment in the future.\nThird, Meta continues to heavily invest in Reality Labs, including investments in augmented rality and virtual reality product development, which should create new revenue streams in the long run. The company's VR headset, Oculus, is already bringing in revenue, but is still at an infant stage when it comes to unlocking the true potential of the mixed-reality headset space. With additional investments in AI supporting the introduction of groundbreaking features, Meta may emerge as a global leader in the AR/VR product space in the long run.\nOverall, Meta's strategic investments in AI should help its growth in the coming years.\nJust over five years ago, Apple decided to pursue a net cash neutral goal when it started generating more than enough cash from operations to support investments and debt repayments. To achieve this objective, the company aggressively repurchased stock and paid dividends, rewarding long-term shareholders. For context, Apple spent an average of $37 billion per year on share repurchases between 2013 and 2018, but since then, it has spent $82 billion on stock buybacks per annum. Unlike Apple, Meta Platforms still enjoys a long runway for growth and the company is investing to expand. However, Meta also generates substantial operating cash flows ($71 billion in 2023) and the company only carries $18 billion in long-term debt. This strong financial position allows it to distribute wealth to shareholders, which is exactly what the company is doing today.\nApple's net income has grown at a compound annual rate of 10.25% between 2018 and 2023, but earnings per share grew at an annualized rate of 15.51% over the same period, aided by substantial buybacks that reduced the share count. Meta, on the other hand, is well-positioned to see strong net income growth, so aggressive buybacks will multiply earnings per share growth in the next few years. Strong earnings growth should support premium valuations.\nMeta, at a forward price-earnings ratio of 23.92, is expensively valued compared to its five-year average of 22.23. This premium valuation, however, seems justifiable given the company is in better shape than ever to grow profitably, aided by its continued dominance in the social media space and the narrowing losses of the Reality Labs division. Meta's buybacks will also play a major role in boosting earnings growth, thereby allowing the company to trade at higher stock prices without a further expansion in earnings multiples.\nInvestors will have to monitor a few key risks, including the company's exposure to China (approximately 10% of revenue in fourth-quarter 2023) and the regulatory challenges in North America and Europe.\nMeta Platforms stock, even on the back of a 146% gain in the last 12 months, looks reasonably priced at a time when it is enjoying a noteworthy expansion in profit margins, which allows it to invest in its future while rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Some volatility is expected in the coming months if macroeconomic conditions in China threaten Meta's short-term profits, but in the long term, the company should thrive even if its China business faces a permanent decline.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Jessica Mathews ",
        "Text": "On Feb. 2, Dr. Aarish Syed Ishaqi arrived at the Apple store on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue early in the morning\u2014around 5:30a.m.\u2014to pick up the much-anticipated Apple Vision Pro.\nIshaqi, a self-described \u201ccrazy Apple fan\u201d and small shareholder in the company, had pre-ordered the $3,500 mixed reality headset to add to his collection of Apple products. But he still wanted to be first in line to pick up the Vision Pro\u2014and he was. Later that day, Ishaqi\u2019s face would be plastered across the internet and TikTok as he emerged from the store with a big grin and a box, posing for photos and videos amid a cheering throng of Apple employees as he triumphantly held his trophy aloft.\n\u201cIt was pretty surreal,\u201d Ishaqi says, noting he met Apple CEO Tim Cook at the New York opening, his third encounter with the Apple boss in the last 12 months.\nCook has billed the Vision Pro as a \u201crevolutionary device\u201d for Apple\u2019s product lineup. And while the company has explicitly kept expectations modest for this first version of the device, positioning it primarily as something for super-fans and developers, Apple\u2019s ultimate goal is for the Vision Pro to create an entirely new product category for its business, similar to the iPhone.\nThe big question is whether the Vision Pro will fare any better than past generations of virtual reality and mixed reality headsets, from Meta\u2019s Quest 3 to the ill-fated Google Glass, which have struggled to catch on outside of niche audiences such as gamers. Early reviews of the Vision Pro have marveled at its capabilities, but flagged shortcomings like the strain it can place on a wearer\u2019s eyes and neck after long durations, and the limited number of apps currently available. Perhaps most worrisome for Apple are reports that many consumers have returned the Vision Pro after playing with it for a few days, deciding it wasn\u2019t what they expected or that it wasn't worth the not-insignificant price they paid for it.\nSo Fortune tracked down the person who may be the most famous Vision Pro user: Ishaqi, the first person in New York to get their hands on the device and the unofficial poster-boy for the Apple Vision Pro. What does he think of his purchase after several weeks? How often does he wear it? Has he returned it? Has it changed his life? His reality?\nHere\u2019s what Ishaqi told us.\nIshaqi, who lives in New Jersey, carted the device back for his whole family to try. (\u201cIt was a pretty heavy box,\u201d he says) His sister and both his parents all tried it on. His sister and mother, in particular, said they had a slight neck strain while wearing it, and Ishaqi agreed it is \u201ca bit heavy.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole weight is on the front of your face. It's unbalanced,\u201d he said, though he noted it didn\u2019t personally bother him much.\nSo far, Ishaqi has used the Vision Pro primarily for entertainment: To watch movies and play games like the immersive game Synth Riders on Apple Arcade. Ishaqi describes using the device as like having your own \u201cpersonal theater\u201d with extraordinarily crisp imagery\u2014although the battery life is limited (it has lasted him about three to four hours, he says, which he hopes will improve over time). His other main complaint was that the dark scenes in some movies he watched had a glare, with a reflection in the lenses.\n\u201cThese are the downsides that I've seen,\u201d he says, though he notes he expected some hiccups with a first-generation product and expects Apple will improve the product over time.\nAs a doctor doing oncology research and pursuing a medical career, Ishaqi is animated about the potential he sees with certain medical applications, including Insight Heart and Surgical AR Vision, which offer 3D medical animation technology.\n\u201cIt is a first gen product. So there are some quirks, but the potential is pretty crazy\u2026 It is a breakthrough in my opinion,\u201d he says.\nIshaqi says he was a bit nervous that he wouldn\u2019t like the Vision Pro technology. After all, he had tried on Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset, but struggled with distortion issues. He says his hands would become wavy through the lenses when he moved them up and down.\n\u201cIt is a bit annoying,\u201d Ishaqi says of the Quest. \u201cWith Apple, there was zero such issue.\u201d Overall, he's very impressed with the technology compared to what else is in the market.\nStill, Ishaqi admits that he uses his Vision Pro less frequently than he expected when he bought it. He didn't expect it to be so heavy to wear or to be so isolating. When there's company over, Ishaqi says it feels odd wearing the headset even though a Vision Pro wearer can see everyone around them by adjusting the so-called pass-through feature. And using it in a public setting, like on the train or at the library, attracts stares \u2014 not least because of the in-the-air hand gestures involved.\n\u201cSo far, I haven't used it much,\u201d Ishaqi told me. The Vision Pro is mostly strapped on and switched on for watching videos, which he says ends up being about one hour a day on average.\nWhen I asked Ishaqi whether it was worth it, he said it depends.\n\u201cFor someone like me? Yes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don't think someone really needs it. Like I said, it's a great experience, but $4,000 just for movies\u2014I think it is a bit much.\u201d\nIf the technology becomes cheaper and lighter in the next few years, and as app developers continue to introduce more applications, Ishaqi says it will make more sense for the average consumer, and that \u201ceveryone's going to have this,\u201d he says.\nAs an early adopter, Ishaqi has no plans to return the Vision Pro. He\u2019s glad he bought it. And besides\u2014the 14-day return window has lapsed.\nA working parent\u2019s review of the Apple Vision Pro\nTim Cook pitches Apple\u2019s new Vision Pro headset as a must-have for businesses despite augmented reality\u2019s checkered history in the workplace\nIf Apple can\u2019t make smart goggles happen, nobody can.

As of 11:45 a.m. in New York, it down less than 1% at $186.03.\nInvestors are digesting an earnings report that included stronger iPhone sales in the holiday quarter and a return to revenue growth following four straight declines. But demand in China was weaker than feared, and Apple signaled to analysts that their iPhone projections for the current quarter may be overly optimistic.\n\u201cI still think China\u2019s a big opportunity for Apple,\u201d Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management co-founder and managing partner, said on Bloomberg Radio. \u201cI think this storm will pass.\u201d\nSales in China dropped 13% to $20.8 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, the company said Thursday. That fell far short of the $23.5 billion predicted by analysts and was Apple\u2019s weakest December quarter in the Asian nation since the first period of 2020.\n\u201cWe are not happy with the decline, but we know China is the most competitive market in the world,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in an interview with Bloomberg Television\u2019s Emily Chang.\nApple is contending with cooling consumer spending in China, rising competition and widening government bans of foreign technology. Huawei Technologies Co. introduced a new line of smartphones last year powered by China-made chips after a US blacklisting had largely driven it out of the market. Huawei\u2019s return sparked a wave of nationalistic buying in the country, with a 36% jump in shipments in the fourth quarter, according to IDC.\nApple\u2019s China struggles contrasted with an overall revenue gain of 2.1% to $119.6 billion. Analysts had predicted an increase of 1% to $118 billion on average.\nWith the growth, Apple avoided posting a fifth straight quarter of declines \u2014 a streak that would have been its worst since a tailspin in the 1990s. The iPhone was a bright spot during the period, generating a 6% revenue gain and exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates.\nBut Maestri warned that Apple\u2019s sales growth may not last. The current quarter will have a tough comparison with the year-earlier period, when pent-up demand for the iPhone added close to $5 billion to sales, he said. At the time, Apple was recovering from supply-chain constraints triggered by Covid lockdowns in China, and consumers were clamoring for iPhones.\n\u201cWhen we remove this impact from last year\u2019s revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago,\u201d he said on a conference call. Analysts had been expecting a 1% sales gain in the period.\nThe earnings report came on the eve of Apple launching the Vision Pro headset Friday. The device vaults the company into its first major new category since 2015 while steering Apple into unfamiliar terrain: virtual and augmented reality. The $3,499 headset lets people watch 3D videos, play games and conduct more immersive meetings.\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook also said that Apple will make an announcement this year on artificial intelligence features, confirming earlier reports by Bloomberg. With Apple\u2019s tech peers pouring money into AI right now, investors have been eagerly awaiting an update from the company on this topic.\nRead More: Vision Pro Is Latest Bid to Prove Consumers Can Embrace Headsets\nFirst-quarter profit climbed 16% to $2.18 a share, topping estimates of $2.11. The iPhone, Apple\u2019s biggest moneymaker, brought in revenue of $69.7 billion, compared with an average projection of $68.6 billion.\nThe latest model, the iPhone 15, was a more significant upgrade than some previous iterations \u2014 with its higher-end versions adding new materials and camera features. The company also had an easier time getting the product to consumers than during the holidays of 2022, when Covid lockdowns in China trigged supply-chain snags. There were no such hiccups this time around.\nApple\u2019s services segment, which includes the App Store and streaming platforms, continued to outpace other divisions. It brought in $23.1 billion during the holiday period, up 11% from a year earlier. Still, that was just shy of the $23.4 billion estimated by Wall Street.\nAs Apple forewarned in November, the iPad was a weak seller during the holidays. Its revenue declined 25% to $7.02 billion. Analysts had predicted $7.06 billion on average.\nIt didn\u2019t help that Apple didn\u2019t release any new models in the last calendar year \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened since the iPad debuted in 2010. But the company is preparing to unveil a bunch of new iPads as early as next month, Bloomberg News has reported.\nApple refreshed its computer lineup in October with three new MacBook Pro models and a new iMac \u2014 powered by speedier M3 chips. That helped sales grow slightly to $7.78 billion, but they still came up short of the $7.9 billion estimate.\nRevenue from the company\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment \u2014 which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods and its TV set-top box \u2014 fell 11% to $11.95 billion. Those products didn\u2019t get significant upgrades this year, which may have hampered sales. Apple also was hit with a US ban on sales of its latest smartwatches over a patent dispute, but that played out after the Christmas shopping season. The company ultimately had to pull a blood-oxygen feature from the devices.\nRead More: Why Apple Had to Disable Oxygen Sensor in Its Watches\nMore broadly, Apple is facing one of the most tumultuous periods since Cook became CEO more than a decade ago. It\u2019s under more regulatory pressure than ever, with new European Union laws forcing it to change its App Store policies. And even with the sales growth last quarter, many of its biggest markets are maturing. Though the Vision Pro could open up a new opportunity, the first version of the product is probably too costly and cumbersome for most consumers.\nChina was the biggest question mark heading into the earnings. Apple\u2019s iPhone won market share in the region last year, but sales have continued to slide. The country also is home to the company\u2019s main manufacturing hub, adding to its importance for Apple.\n\u201cWe continue to see significant opportunity for us in China in the long term,\u201d Maestri said in the interview.\n--With assistance from Emily Chang, Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong\nThe Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About\nLayoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren\u2019t Sacred Anymore\nHSBC\u2019s New \u2018Wise Killer\u2019 App Vies for FX Customers\nThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "Author": "  Stephen Nellis ",
        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) -Apple on Thursday forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below Wall Street expectations as its China business took a hit.\nThis overshadowed overall fiscal first-quarter sales and profit that beat analysts' targets, powered by iPhone growth, sending Apple shares down 3% in after-hours trade.\nThe results confirmed some analysts' concerns that the company's signature product is losing ground in the key Asian market where consumers are buying foldable phones and phones from Huawei, powered by a China-made chip.\n\"China is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and that hasn't changed,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. He said iPhone sales there were down \"mid-single digits\" in the December quarter, when accounting for currency exchange rates.\n\"In China, Apple is facing more competitive challenges not only because of Huawei but also because of foldables, which is a very popular and fast-growing segment in China - and as we all know, Apple does not have a foldable device - yet,\" said IDC analyst Nabila Popal.\nApple said sales in China in the December quarter were $20.82 billion, missing analyst estimates of $23.53 billion, according to LSEG data.\nRevenue in the current quarter will be at least $5 billion less than a year ago, when the company sold iPhones rapidly to replenish inventories drawn down by COVID-related factory shutdowns, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call.\nMaestri's comments implied a revenue forecast of about $90 billion and iPhone sales of around $46 billion for the fiscal second quarter that ends in March. Wall Street expected nearly $96 billion in revenue and iPhone sales of $50 billion. They were $51 billion in the 2023 quarter.\nThat would make it the company's worst fiscal second quarter of iPhone sales since widespread COVID lockdowns in March 2020.\n\"The drag would be China - and it has everything to do with their seasonality, and the elongated replacement cycle,\" said Ben Bajarin, CEO of research firm Creative Strategies.\n\"Regardless of what happens, (a drop in) year-over-year iPhone sales would be more of a concern than a quarter.\"\nFor its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30, Apple reported sales of $119.58 billion and profit of $2.18 per share, both above analyst expectations of $117.91 billion and $2.10 per share.\nSales of iPhones hit $69.70 billion in the quarter, growing 6% to beat analyst expectations of $67.82 billion, on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple's total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago.\n\"We had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China,\" Cook said.\n'HUGE OPPORTUNITY'\nWhere Apple's results disappointed, two other tech heavyweights, Amazon.com and Facebook owner Meta Platforms, reported quarterly results on Thursday which led to jumps in their share prices.\nMicrosoft in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the AI race among tech heavyweights.\nApple has rarely discussed generative AI but on Thursday Cook said on the conference call that it was a \"huge opportunity\" and there was \"a lot of work going on internally\" but that he did not plan to discuss it publicly until later this year.\nIn the rest of Asia beyond China and Japan, Apple's sales hit $10.16 billion, above analyst estimates. Cook said that iPhone sales hit an all-time high in South Korea, home to longtime rival Samsung Electronics.\nThe biggest growth area for Apple during its fiscal first quarter was its services business, which includes the Apple TV+ service as well as music, iCloud storage and the App Store, and which rose 11% to $23.12 billion in sales, slightly below analyst expectations.\nApple's App Store also faces a challenge in Europe, where a new law that takes effect in March will allow developers to skip paying commissions to Apple and place alternative app stores on the iPhone.\nApple's first-quarter Mac sales were up slightly to $7.78 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Sales of iPads were down 25% to $7.02 billion, a little behind Wall Street's target.\nApple's wearables segment, which includes its AirPods and Apple Watch sales, fell to $11.95 billion after company executives had warned of weak demand, just enough to top analysts' targets\nThe company's Vision Pro headset will be included in the segment in subsequent quarters, though analysts do not expect it to bring meaningful revenue for several years.\nSeveral Apple Watch models have been at the center of a legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo and were briefly pulled from shelves before Apple removed a blood-oxygen monitoring features to comply with legal rulings and keep selling the devices.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San FranciscoAdditional reporting by Arsheeya Singh Bajwa and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Max A.

        "Text": "After sales dipped 2.8% in its fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was finally able to return to growth in the latest quarter as revenue increased 2.1%. The tech titan also reported a 13% jump in net income, showing once again how profitable of an enterprise this is.\nThrough the ups and downs, investors by and large have remained positive. The top FAANG stock has soared over 40% since the start of 2023 as investors have sought to ride the momentum of strong returns.\nOne notably positive number stood out -- 2.2 billion -- providing good reason to buy Apple shares. However, one critical metric should give investors pause. Here's what you need to know about the iPhone maker.\nShareholders and analysts undoubtedly focus on key figures like revenue, margins, free cash flow (FCF), and how well different products, such as the iPhone, MacBooks, and iPads, sold in any given period. These are certainly important numbers that can help one understand Apple's success.\nBut there's one data point that truly demonstrates the sheer dominance of this business. \"I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices,\" CEO Tim Cook said on the first-quarter 2024 earnings call. This figure was up from about 2 billion just six months ago. And it continues to rise with each passing quarter.\nNot only does this represent how successful and ubiquitous Apple has become, but it also indicates how powerful of an ecosystem the company has built. There are 2.2 billion devices out there all using Apple's various software and subscription solutions, which produce a very profitable (73% gross margin) revenue stream. And this division was able to grow sales at a faster clip than hardware in the latest fiscal quarter, which is an ongoing trend.\nInvestors looking to own stocks for the long haul should want the businesses to have durability. With its massive installed base that keeps getting larger, Apple fits the bill here. These are loyal customers who understand how great the products and services are. \nThis stickiness helps support Apple's powerful brand presence, which is likely a key reason why Warren Buffett, through his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, is such a big shareholder and fan of the company.\nThanks to Apple shares soaring 331% in the last five years and 867% in the last decade, this has become one of the most valuable businesses on the face of the planet. Additionally, the market fully understands Apple's favorable qualities and dominance.\nConsequently, the stock isn't cheap. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 29 today. Compared to the stock's trailing 10-year average P/E multiple of 20.9, this represents a sizable 38% premium. \nApple's loudest bulls might believe this valuation is justified. The huge and growing installed base I mentioned above is impressive. Moreover, Apple is incredibly profitable, reporting an average operating margin of 27.8% in the last 20 fiscal quarters. This business generated insane amounts of free cash flow in fiscal 2023, and currently has a net cash balance of $65 billion.\nHowever, I believe Apple's growth prospects going forward will be more limited. Consumers have less of a reason to upgrade their iPhones as frequently, mainly because innovations are becoming marginal at best. And unless Apple can introduce another truly revolutionary product, one big enough to move the needle financially, double-digit top-line gains are out of the question, in my opinion.\nThe elevated valuation implies high expectations from investors. And this could pressure potential returns over the next several years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) is ratcheting up the security of its iMessage app to protect users against future attacks by high-powered, nation-state hackers. The company says it is updating the security protocol behind iMessage to combat attacks using quantum computers.\nAccording to Apple, while it\u2019s difficult to break the company\u2019s current encryptions using conventional supercomputers, quantum computers could make cracking those encryptions child\u2019s play. To that end, the company is introducing what it calls its PQ3 cryptographic protocol, a new form of encrypting users' messages that will exist alongside Apple\u2019s existing encryption tools.\nThe reason for the move, Apple says, is to prevent what are referred to as \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d attacks. The idea is relatively simple: Sophisticated attackers suck up encrypted data, whether that\u2019s a person\u2019s texts or government secrets, with the hope of decrypting that information in the future when quantum computers become powerful and reliable enough to do so.\nQuantum computers are fundamentally different from the supercomputers in use today. Conventional supercomputers perform calculations using binary code, which is made up of strings of 1s and 0s that systems translate into everything from YouTube videos to the webpage you\u2019re reading this on.\nQuantum computers, on the other hand, process data using what are known as qubits, which can be made up of electrons and protons and can exist as 1s and 0s at the same time. They\u2019re also capable of processing the kind of calculations that would overwhelm a traditional supercomputer.\nYou might have seen a quantum computer in an article or two displaying its intricate collection of cooling pipes that help keep the system hovering just above absolute zero, which allows for the use of superconductors.\nBut quantum computers aren\u2019t exactly available at your local Best Buy. The systems are generally used by major tech firms \u2014 IBM (IBM) has famously been working with the technology for years \u2014 and government agencies.\nWhat\u2019s more, quantum computers aren\u2019t as reliable as conventional supercomputers. But security experts fear when they reach a certain level of power and reliability, they\u2019ll easily cut through traditional encryption methods.\nThe day when quantum computers can break those encryptions, which protect everything from our messages to national security secrets, is referred to as \u201cQ-day,\u201d and while there\u2019s no firm agreement on when it will occur, many believe it will happen in the coming decades.\nApple is banking on Q-day coming sooner than later and is working to ensure iMessages are protected. Importantly, Apple says there are no motivating factors behind the move to roll out quantum computing protections. Rather, it\u2019s a proactive move designed to upgrade the app\u2019s overall security posture.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Wall Street is particularly bullish about tech stocks now. Excitement about budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and easing inflation sent the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index up 47% since last February.\nAs the world's two most valuable companies and leaders in tech, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have seen their shares rise 54% and 18% during the period. These companies are some of the most attractive ways to invest in the industry, with one a king in productivity software and the other leading the consumer tech market.\nMicrosoft and Apple have long histories of delivering consistent stock growth, and that looks unlikely to change. Over the last year, Microsoft emerged as one of the biggest names in AI. Meanwhile, Apple is home to a highly profitable services business and is gaining market share in the virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) industry.\nSo, let's examine these businesses and determine whether Microsoft or Apple is the better tech stock this February.\nIn January, Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company, with its market cap at just over $3 trillion.\nThe company is a tech behemoth with positions in multiple areas of the industry, leading in productivity software, game consoles, cloud computing, and operating systems. Its diverse business model allows it to profit from tailwinds across tech, making its stock an exceptionally reliable option.\nSince 2019, Microsoft's annual revenue climbed 68%, with operating income up 106%. Additionally, its free cash flow jumped 76% to $67 billion.\nThe company has significant cash reserves, allowing it to keep investing in its business and retain its prominent role in tech. Microsoft became a leader in AI after sinking billions into ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The partnership granted Microsoft access to some of the sector's most advanced AI models, which it used to carve out a lucrative position in the budding industry.\nThe AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit nearly $2 trillion before the end of the decade.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup. In 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite with the help of AI.\nApple hasn't had it as easy as Microsoft in the last year. In 2023, macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines.\nThe streak was finally broken in Apple's latest quarter, with revenue rising 2% year over year to $120 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The company beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\nHowever, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business, with its stock down nearly 6% year to date. Smartphone sales rose 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. The country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.\nAs a result, it's promising that the company is expanding its product lineup and prioritizing digital markets like services to lean less on iPhone sales over the long term. \nThe company released the Vision Pro, its first VR/AR headset, earlier this year. Launching at $3,499, the new device created significant hype for the technology. If the company employs a similar pricing strategy to that used with past products and brings down the cost with subsequent generations, an investment in Apple could be an investment in the future leader of the VR/AR market.\nThe VR market alone is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31% until at least 2030. It could be smart to invest in the tech giant at the very start of its journey into the industry.\nAlongside free cash flow that hit $107 billion last year, Apple has the funds to overcome current headwinds and keep investing in high-growth areas of tech.\nMicrosoft and Apple have exciting long-term outlooks, with opportunities to profit from multiple subsectors of tech.\nHowever, Microsoft's more significant priority on digital markets like cloud computing and AI makes it less vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds and potentially the more reliable buy.\nMeanwhile, earnings-per-share estimates indicate Microsoft has more growth potential than Apple in the near term.\nMicrosoft's earnings could hit just under $16 per share, while Apple's may reach nearly $8 per share in the next two fiscal years. Multiplying those figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Microsoft's 35 and Apple's 28) yields a stock price of $546 for Microsoft and $218 for Apple.\nLooking at their current positions, these projections would see Microsoft's stock rise by 35% and Apple's increase by 20% by fiscal 2026. If these projections are correct, Microsoft has significantly more room to run and is the better tech stock to buy this month.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "Apple\u2019s biggest fans have already returned the long-awaited Apple Vision Pro, saying the headset isn\u2019t worth the hefty $3,500 price tag. Apple stock went up following the Vision Pro release, but will the surge last?\nI\u2019m a Financial Advisor: I\u2019d Invest My First $5,000 in These 6 StocksExplore: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nSince the Apple Vision Pro debuted on Feb. 2, there\u2019s been a larger-than-expected number of returns. While returns are normal, the higher return rate suggests there are some quirks to work out.\nHere are the biggest complaints Bloomberg reported after speaking to more than a dozen people who returned the Vision Pro:\nThe device is too heavy, too cumbersome to manage, headache-inducing and uncomfortable.\nThe lack of applications and video content doesn\u2019t justify the $3,500 price.\nThe work features are difficult to use for long periods and don\u2019t make people more productive than using a normal external monitor with a Mac.\nThe displays have too much glare, the field of view is too narrow and it causes eyestrain and vision problems.\nIt can make users feel isolated from family and friends, the meaningful shared experiences don\u2019t yet exist and the Vision Pro can\u2019t easily be passed around to others because of the need for a precise fit.\nVision Pro fans say the current model is only the first generation, which should only get better with time. The first iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch had their problems, but Bloomberg noted nobody complained those devices were too cumbersome, a pain to use or too heavy to justify keeping.\nData from sources at retail stores told Bloomberg the return rate is between average and above average compared with other products, depending on the location. Some smaller stores are seeing two returns per day, but larger stores have seen as many as over eight in a single day. However, the Vision Pro is a low-volume product, which Apple expected from the beginning, and this isn\u2019t a sign of a big problem.\nApple is at least 18 months away from releasing a second-generation Vision Pro, but the company is taking the return rate seriously. When customers return the device, staff ask them what went wrong, Bloomberg reported, and employees have also been instructed to report to a manager after each return.\nAccording to Tastylive, Apple stock prices dropped 4.22% in January, but prices were back on the up in early February following the Vision Pro release. Apple stock is now down 5.3% so far in 2024, but Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told The Motley Fool he sees this drop as a buying opportunity. The analyst sees the Vision Pro as a growth catalyst, and his sales forecast is 600,000 units in 2024 with one million unit sales in 2025.\nThe Apple Vision Pro could have a measurable impact, but it\u2019s still too early to tell.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Best New Dollar Tree Items That Are Worth Every Penny\nAverage Cost of Groceries Per Month: How Much Should You Be Spending?\n8 Signs You'll Retire Wealthy\n4 Reasons You Should Be Getting Your Paycheck Early, According to An Expert\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Apple Vision Pro\u2019s Biggest Complaints \u2014 Are Returns Affecting Stock Price?\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc's robust financial performance with a significant increase in net income.\nContinued dominance in the smartphone market with the iPhone as a key revenue driver.\nExpansion in services and wearables presenting new growth avenues.\nChallenges from global economic uncertainties and competitive pressures.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a global leader in technology, released its 10-Q filing on February 2, 2024, revealing the company's financial performance for the quarter ended December 30, 2023. The filing indicates a solid financial position, with net sales amounting to $119.575 billion, a slight increase from the previous year's $117.154 billion. The company's net income saw a notable rise to $33.916 billion from $29.998 billion, showcasing Apple's ability to maintain profitability amidst a competitive landscape. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the recent SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of Apple Inc's strategic positioning.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CHTR.\nFinancial Resilience and Product Dominance: Apple's financial health remains robust, with an increase in net income to $33.916 billion, up from $29.998 billion in the previous year. This financial resilience is underpinned by the iPhone's continued dominance in the market, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Apple's ability to maintain high-profit margins, particularly in its services segment, which saw an 11% increase in net sales, further solidifies its financial strength. The company's diversified product portfolio, including the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, complements the iPhone ecosystem, creating a comprehensive suite of products that drive customer loyalty and recurring revenue.\nInnovation and Brand Equity: Apple's commitment to research and development, with expenses maintained at $7.696 billion, underscores its focus on innovation. The company's brand is synonymous with quality and innovation, which is reflected in its strong gross margin of $54.855 billion. Apple's brand equity is a competitive advantage that allows it to command premium pricing and maintain a loyal customer base. The introduction of new products, such as the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, demonstrates Apple's continuous effort to innovate and meet consumer demands.\nDependence on Key Products: Despite its financial success, Apple's heavy reliance on the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue, poses a risk. Any disruption in the iPhone's market appeal or supply chain could have a substantial impact on the company's overall performance. Additionally, the decrease in iPad sales by 25% indicates potential vulnerabilities in Apple's product mix that need to be addressed to ensure sustained growth.\nSupply Chain and Geopolitical Risks: Apple's supply chain is complex and global, with significant exposure to geopolitical risks and trade tensions, particularly in Greater China, where net sales decreased by 13%. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners and individual suppliers for components and manufacturing also presents operational risks that could affect its ability to deliver products efficiently and cost-effectively.\nServices and Wearables Expansion: The growth in Apple's services and wearables segments presents significant opportunities. With an 11% increase in services net sales, Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital content, cloud services, and subscription-based models. The wearables market also offers potential for expansion, despite a decrease in sales, as consumer interest in health and fitness technology continues to rise.\nInternational Markets and New Technologies: Apple's performance in international markets, such as a 15% increase in Japan net sales, highlights the opportunity for further geographic expansion. Additionally, the company's investments in new technologies, such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence, could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive position in the long term.\nCompetitive Pressure and Market Saturation: The technology industry is highly competitive, with rapid innovation and changing consumer preferences. Apple faces intense competition from other smartphone and technology manufacturers, which could erode its market share and pressure margins. Market saturation, particularly in mature markets, poses a challenge to growth, as most consumers already own smartphones and upgrade cycles lengthen.\nEconomic Uncertainties and Regulatory Changes: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation and currency fluctuations, can impact consumer spending and Apple's international sales. Regulatory changes, such as those related to privacy and antitrust concerns, could also force Apple to alter its business practices, potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction.\nIn conclusion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand equity, driven by its flagship iPhone and a growing services segment. However, the company must navigate challenges such as product dependence, supply chain complexities, and competitive pressures. Opportunities for expansion in services, wearables, and international markets are countered by threats from market saturation and regulatory changes. Apple's strategic focus on innovation and customer experience positions it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic tech landscape.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "(Reuters) \u2014 Apple has persuaded a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit by a Silicon Valley startup accusing it of illegally monopolizing the US market for heart rate monitoring apps for its Apple Watch.\nUS District Judge Jeffrey White in Oakland, California, ruled on Tuesday against AliveCor, which had developed an app for detecting irregular heartbeats.\nIt had accused Apple of violating the federal Sherman antitrust law and a California unfair competition law.\nThe decision explaining White's reasoning is temporarily being kept under seal because of confidentiality concerns.\n\"AliveCor is deeply disappointed and strongly disagrees with the court's decision to dismiss our anti-competition case and we plan to appeal,\" the company said in a statement.\nApple said in a statement that the lawsuit challenged its ability to make improvements to the Apple Watch that consumers and developers rely on. \"Today's outcome confirms that is not anticompetitive,\" it said.\nIn an amended complaint, AliveCor said Apple had led it to believe it would collaborate on heart-monitoring technology for the Apple Watch, only to then copy its ideas and embark on a \"concentrated campaign to corner the market for heartrate analysis.\"\nThe complaint also accused Apple of \"updating\" the heartrate algorithm for its watches, to prevent third parties from identifying irregular heartbeats and offering competing apps.\nAliveCor had developed KardiaBand, a wristband for the Apple Watch capable of recording an electrocardiogram, or ECG.\nThe Mountain View, California-based company also developed the Kardia app for analyzing ECG readings on Apple Watches, and a SmartRhythm heartrate analysis app powered by artificial intelligence.\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, has denied wrongdoing, and said competitors have no right to dictate its design decisions.\nAliveCor is still litigating separate patent infringement claims against Apple.\nThe case is AliveCor Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 21-03958.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Sandra Maler)\n"

        "Author": "  Steve Blank ",
        "Text": "Apple has started shipping its Apple Vision Pro, its take on a headset that combines Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).\nWhile the product is an amazing technical tour de force, I believe the product-market fit of this first iteration is a swing and a miss.\nI\u2019ve watched other world-class consumer product companies make the same mistakes over and over again:\nCome up with amazing hardware that creates entirely new capabilities.\nForecast demand based on volumes of their previous consumer products.\nConfuse consumers by defining a new category without a frame of reference.\nDiscover that the hardware doesn\u2019t match the needs of their existing customer base.\nWork hard and spend a lot of money on trying to push sales on their existing customers.\nRevenue woefully falls short of forecast. Marketing and capital expenses (new factory, high research and development expense) were predicated on consumer-scale sales. The new product is burning a ton of cash.\nIgnore or fail to understand adjacent niche industrial markets that would have rushed to buy the product if the company had developed niche-specific demos and outreach.\nEventually, pivot to the niche markets that are excited about the product.\nThe niche markets make for great beachhead markets but are too small to match the inflated forecasts and the built-in burn rates of consumer-scale sales.\nAfter multiple market pivots and changes in leadership, abandon the product.\nI lived through the equivalent of this when Kodak (remember them?) launched a product in 1990 called PhotoCD. Kodak wanted consumers to put their film photos on their home CDROM drives and then display them on their televisions. You dropped off your film at a film processor and instead of just getting physical prints of your pictures they would scan the film and burn them onto a Compact Disc. You\u2019d go home with a Compact Disc with your pictures on it.\nI got a preview of PhotoCD when I was the head of marketing at SuperMac, a supplier of hardware and software for graphics professionals. The moment I saw the product I knew every one of my professional graphics customers (ad agencies, freelancers, photo studios, etc.) would want to use it. In fact, they would have paid a premium for it. I was floored when Kodak told me they were launching PhotoCD as a consumer product.\nThe problem was that in 1990, consumers did not have CDROM drives to display the pictures. At the time, even most personal computers lacked them. Meanwhile, every graphics professional did own a CDROM drive but most didn\u2019t own a high-resolution film scanner. They would have been the perfect launch customers for PhotoCD. To this day, I remember being lectured by a senior Kodak executive, \u201cSteve you don\u2019t get it, we\u2019re experts at selling to consumers. We\u2019ll sell them the CDROM drives as well.\u201d\nExcept the Kodak CDROM drives were the size of professional audio equipment and depending on the model, cost $600 to $1000 in today\u2019s dollars. And when consumer CDROM drives became available they couldn\u2019t play the PhotoCD disks as they were encoded in a proprietary Kodak standard to lock you into their drives!\nThe result? PhotoCD failed miserably as a consumer product. Subsequent pivots to professional graphics users (a segment they knew well) came too late, as low-cost scanners and non-proprietary standards (JPEG) prevailed.\nSimilarly, Apple is trying to push Vision Pro onto their existing consumer customers. All the demos and existing applications are tailored to the consumer market.\nAdditionally, Apple did not create demos for how the Vision Pro could be used in new markets where users would jump at the opportunity to buy a Vision Pro. For example, the internet is rife with proof of demand in an adjacent mass market: helping millions of homeowners repair things around their property.\nThere is also proven demand for Industrial applications outside of the consumer space. Every company that has complex machinery has been experimenting with AR for years. Imagine car repair with a Vision Pro AR tutorial. Or jet engine maintenance. Or the entire gamut of complex machinery. All of these would have been great Vision Pro demos for training and repair. It\u2019s hard to understand why Apple ignored these easy wins.\nApple\u2019s entry into new markets by creating new product categories\u2013iPods, iPads, iPhones\u2013is unprecedented in the history of modern corporations. $300 billion (75% of their revenue) is from non-computer hardware. In addition, they\u2019ve created an entirely new $85+ billion subscription business model with the App Store, iTunes, Apple Care, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and Apple TV.\nIt\u2019s hard to remember, but the first versions of these products launched with serious limitations that follow-on versions remedied. The first version of the iPhone only ran Apple software, it had no app store. It was a closed system. It had no copy-and-paste function, and couldn\u2019t record video, among other limitations. The original Apple Watch was positioned as a fashion accessory. It wasn\u2019t until later that Apple realized the Watch's killer apps were fitness and health. Fixing the technical flaws while finding the right markets took time and commitment.\nThe same will likely be true for the Vision Pro. Apple\u2019s model is to provide the hardware and then let their developer community come up with the kind of applications. However, all of the applications on this first release are in their current markets (entertainment, music, etc.). None of these are killer apps for the product.\nApple marketers will realize that adjacent spaces they are less familiar with will provide the first \"got to have it\" beachhead markets. Newer iterations will ride the technology wave of lighter and cheaper versions.\nApple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook has made a personal bet on the Vision Pro. More than any other company, they have sufficient resources (cash on hand and engineering talent) to pivot\u2013and ensure the Vision Pro\u2019s product-market fit in the real markets that need it. Here\u2019s to hoping they find it.\nSteve Blank is an adjunct professor at Stanford and co-founder of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation. \nThe markets are starting to realize\u00a0just how hawkish the Fed is\u2013and reckoning with higher-for-longer interest rates\nWorking fathers are the new target of microaggressions\u2013and they are worried they could be getting\u00a0\u2018daddy tracked\u2019\nWEF president:\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s time to revitalize trade\u2014and reverse the trend of Slowbalization\u2019\nThe anti-DEI movement has gone\u00a0from fringe to mainstream.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) share prices are down about 5% on the year so far, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees the drop as a buying opportunity.\nThe analyst recently maintained his buy rating on the stock and reiterated a $250 near-term price target. That target represents a 35% upside from the current share price of $183. His optimism reflects sales expectations for Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which the company describes in press releases as \"a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world.\"\nAnalysts at Wedbush originally set the high price target last year on the expectation of strong sales of the iPhone 15. Sure enough, Apple reported better-than-expected revenue of $119 billion in the December-ending quarter, driven by iPhone.\nIves now sees Apple's Vision Pro headset -- the company's first major computing product since the Apple Watch -- as a growth catalyst that could provide upside to Apple's long-term earnings growth. His sales forecast is 600,000 units in 2024 with 1 million unit sales in 2025.\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan has the same forecast for 2025, and he raised his projection to 4 million units for 2026.\nApple stock is not cheap, trading at a high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and the Vision Pro may take a while to catch on with Apple's customers, especially given its high retail price tag of $3,499.\nHowever, Apple has a long history of delivering new products that people eventually can't live without but didn't think they wanted in the first place. This is a highly profitable business, with nearly $100 billion in annual free cash flow, and it got to this point by making calculated bets on what it thinks customers are going to love.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s longest-serving senior industrial designer is leaving the company, marking the near-complete turnover of a team once led by Jony Ive.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump, Sons and Associate Hit With $364 Million Fraud Fine\nAlexey Navalny, Jailed Activist Who Defied Putin, Dies at 47\nWall Street Ends Wild Week on Sour Note After PPI: Markets Wrap\nHawaii Rightly Rejects Supreme Court\u2019s Gun Nonsense\nApple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot\nBart Andre, who joined Apple in 1992 alongside Ive, told colleagues this month that he is retiring, according to people familiar with the matter. Andre was one of the last remaining designers from the Ive era and helped create the aesthetic for Apple products released over the past three decades \u2014 even prior to Steve Jobs returning to the helm in the late 1990s.\nThe designer was known as one of Ive\u2019s top lieutenants and helped run the team after former chief Evans Hankey, Ive\u2019s successor, departed last year. He\u2019s also known as one of the biggest holders of Apple patents.\n\u201cHis mark on Apple products is indelible \u2014 I see him every day in the details,\u201d said Christopher Stringer, who used to work with Andre at Apple and now runs sound company Syng.\nThe departure is the latest in recent months for the group. Top designers Colin Burns, Shota Aoyagi and Peter Russell-Clarke all left around the end of last year. Multiple longtime designers on Apple\u2019s software design team have also signaled they are planning to leave in the near future.\nBoth the industrial-design and user-interface groups are overseen by Jeff Williams, the company\u2019s chief operating officer. He\u2019s held that role since Ive\u2019s departure in 2019 but took on direct management of the industrial-design team last year when Hankey left.\nHaving an operations person oversee a division dedicated to design and innovation has rankled some staff, according to the people close to the situation. There have also been cost-cutting measures that have added to the unrest, they said. Under Ive, the team embarked on exploratory projects that didn\u2019t necessarily have an immediate payoff \u2014 something that\u2019s been reined in.\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nIve\u2019s core design team was made up of about two dozen people for well over a decade. Around the time Ive left in 2019, an exodus began. Nearly all of the senior designers who reported directly to Ive have now left. Many of them joined LoveFrom, a design firm founded by Ive that worked with Apple until two years ago.\nThe industrial-design team has been replenished with new outside talent, but there are few longtime members remaining who worked under Ive and helped create hit products like the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Richard Howarth, who serves as vice president of design, is a carryover from the Ive era, along with Molly Anderson and Duncan Kerr.\nSince Hankey\u2019s departure, the most senior designers have led the team\u2019s day-to-day operations, working alongside Williams. The operating chief was picked to manage the group, in part, so that he could better coordinate with the manufacturing team. There also was a lack of other viable options to replace Hankey.\nRead More: Apple\u2019s Brain Drain Hinders Efforts to Pick Its Next Jony Ive\nThe Apple design team is tasked with devising the look and feel of devices and software, as well as developing new features and interfaces.

The drop was jarring enough to overshadow otherwise strong results, which included Apple\u2019s first overall sales growth in a year.\nBut the signs of trouble in China have been accumulating for months. The country\u2019s government imposed stricter bans on the use of foreign technology in the workplace. Local rival Huawei Technologies Co. released a hot new smartphone touted as a local alternative to the iPhone. And Apple began offering rare discounts on its latest models.\nRead More: Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?\nSales of iPads and wearable technology have been particularly weak in the country, adding up to a bleak picture. The company also warned that iPhone growth in the current quarter won\u2019t be as strong as Wall Street anticipated, forcing analysts to rethink their projections. They went through a similar exercise with Apple\u2019s previous earnings three months earlier.\n\u201cWe believe expectations need to move lower, yet again,\u201d Brandon Nispel, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.\nChina\u2019s importance to Apple goes beyond its status as the company\u2019s third-largest market by revenue. It\u2019s the country where Apple produces the vast majority of its devices, but also a tantalizing growth opportunity thanks to its 1.4 billion people and expanding middle class.\nOn a conference call with analysts Thursday, executives said their faith in China wasn\u2019t shaken. Apple\u2019s installed base is still growing, and current customers continue to upgrade their devices, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. Still, iPhone revenue fell by a percentage in the mid-single digits when holding currency rates constant.\n\u201cI remain very optimistic about China over the long term,\u201d Cook said.\nChief Financial Officer Luca Maestri described the phone sector in China as the \u201cmost competitive market in the world.\u201d And Apple isn\u2019t the only player struggling to grow. Several of the top mobile makers saw shipments decrease last quarter, according to IDC. In fact, Apple took first place in the market because it didn\u2019t shrink as much as others, the research firm said.\nRead More: iPhone Takes Top Spot in China for First Time Despite Challenges\nBut Huawei has bucked the downward trend. The company \u2014 blacklisted by the US over national security concerns \u2014 saw shipments surge 36% in China. That vaulted it to fourth place.\nThe technology company launched the Mate 60 Pro phone last year just before the iPhone 15 went on sale. The Huawei device, which runs on Chinese-made chips, is benefiting from a renewed wave of nationalism in the country.\nThat\u2019s led to countermeasures. Last month, Apple began offering discounts of as much as 500 yuan ($70) on the iPhone 15 \u2014 a step it doesn\u2019t usually have to take. The markdown was equivalent to about 5% off its top-of-the-line model.\nA resurgent Huawei and other manufacturers are posing a bigger threat than before, said Ivan Lam, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. In some cases, consumers are buying those brands rather than older iPhone 13 and 14 models, he said.\n\u201cThis is a competitive issue,\u201d Lam said.\n--With assistance from Charlotte Yang.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About\nThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

The company is warning against putting wet phones in uncooked rice to dry them out.\nIn new guidance for salvaging phones that come into contact with liquid, Apple is advising users to let them dry out on their own, rather than by submerging them in uncooked rice.\nMany people rely on uncooked rice to dry out wet electronics because the grains absorb liquids quickly \u2014 but Apple said that the technique can actually damage your iPhone.\n\"Don't put your iPhone in a bag of rice\"\nApple is telling iPhone users explicitly what not to do when a \"Liquid Detected\" warning appears on screen.\n\"Don't put your iPhone in a bag of rice. Doing so could allow small particles of rice to damage your iPhone,\" the company says.\nAlso, when a \"Liquid Detected\" alert appears on a phone's screen, don't try to charge the device until both the phone and the cable are completely dry, Apple said.\n\"If you charge your iPhone while the Lightning or USB-C connector is wet, the pins on the connector or cable can corrode and cause permanent damage or stop functioning, causing connectivity issues for your iPhone or accessory,\" Apple explains.\nTap the phone and leave it in a dry area\nInstead, unplug the phone from its power adapter, and gently tap the phone against your hand, with the charging port facing down, in order to let excess liquid drain from the device. Then leave the iPhone in a dry area with airflow, Apple says.\nA wireless iPhone charger also won't cause damage.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can try to reconnect the device to a power adapter. An alert will indicate if liquid remains in the phone, with Apple noting that It could take up to 24 hours for a device to completely dry out.\nAlso avoid trying to dry it with an external heat source or compressed air. For example, don't use a hair dryer, and avoid inserting cotton swabs and other objects into the connector to try to absorb any liquid, the company said.\nNikki Haley vows to continue campaign through Super Tuesday\n7-year-old girl dies after beach hole collapsed on her and her brother\nHaley defies calls from Trump to drop out of 2024 race\n"

        "Text": "In an alternate dimension, Apple Inc. might have absorbed Tesla Inc., a scenario contingent on a non-existent dialogue between the leaders of each company, Elon Musk and Tim Cook.\nDuring a critical juncture for Tesla, amidst its Model 3 production challenges, Elon Musk sought Apple\u2019s intervention for a possible takeover, reflecting on this in a 2020 tweet highlighted by CNBC. This was a time marked by economic difficulties and production obstacles for the electric vehicle giant. Musk aimed to discuss Tesla\u2019s acquisition with Cook in these \u201cdarkest days,\u201d as he described them, yet Musk revealed that Cook refused the meeting. Looking back, Cook\u2019s decision appears to be a decisive turn, given Tesla\u2019s subsequent ascent and transformative role in the car industry.\nJournalist Ross Gerber confirmed this. \u201cI remember when so well. Said it on TV how many times to Cook. Buy tesla buy tesla. Not even a meeting...,\u201d he said in a 2020 tweet.\n\nLater, Cook shared his perspective. According to IndiaTimes, Cook said, \"You know, I\u2019ve never spoken to Elon. And there are lots of companies out there that we could\u2019ve bought from at different times, probably. But I feel really good about where we are today.\"\nCook\u2019s statement suggests a possible oversight or deliberate omission of the proposal. He further noted, \u201cI don't recall it happening that way. But if he says it did, I take his word for it.\u201d\nThis episode underscores a potentially groundbreaking merger in the realms of technology and automotive. For Musk, it represented a quest for rescue during Tesla\u2019s trying times. For Cook and Apple, it marked a decision point, opting to continue their established path of strategy and product innovation instead of exploring new automotive avenues.\nIn retrospect, Cook\u2019s decision not to pursue Musk\u2019s offer appears to be a significant turning point. It highlights the unpredictable nature of the tech industry, where today\u2019s uncertainty can lead to tomorrow\u2019s success. Tesla\u2019s journey since then has been a meteoric rise.\nIn the tech industry, potential partnerships are continuously explored, and what might seem like a missed opportunity can lead to independent paths of monumental success.\nStartups offer ground-level opportunities where newcomers can invest, innovate and potentially become the next big success story. Just as Tesla emerged from its struggles to become a leader in its field, any newcomer in the tech industry could potentially rise to prominence, either independently or through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.\nThe tech landscape is dynamic and full of possibilities, where today\u2019s small venture could be tomorrow\u2019s industry titan or part of an even larger enterprise, mirroring the potential path Tesla and Apple could have taken.\nOriginal publication: December 1, 2023\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Elon Musk Wanted To Sell Tesla To Apple, But CEO Tim Cook Does Not Recall Ever Speaking To Him originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

The Financial Times reported the fine earlier.\nEU competition chief Margrethe Vestager has made it a core strategy to attempt to dismantle Big Tech\u2019s dominance in the bloc through fines and regulatory actions. She\u2019s slapped Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google with penalties of more than \u20ac8 billion and also ordered Apple to repay \u20ac13 billion in allegedly unfair tax breaks from Ireland.\nApple has also faced pressure from individual EU member states. It was fined \u20ac1.1 billion in France in 2020 for anti-competitive behavior, although the total was later reduced to \u20ac372 million after an appeal.\nThe EU\u2019s investigation into Apple\u2019s App Store was sparked by a complaint nearly four years ago from Spotify, which claimed it was forced to ramp up the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs associated with Apple\u2019s alleged stranglehold on how the App Store operates.\nIn a closed-door meeting between EU officials and Apple in June last year, the tech firm told regulators it had already addressed any possible competition concerns arising from Spotify\u2019s complaint.\nIn a separate probe, Apple is set to have its settlement proposal in the EU\u2019s investigation into its tap-and-pay tech accepted, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe commission is poised to accept a 10-year offer from Apple to open up access to its coveted near-field communication chip on iPhones to rival digital wallets, after a market test received largely positive feedback, the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private, said.\nApple\u2019s move to settle the case came after the EU watchdog earlier raised formal concerns that the company had restricted access to the technology, amounting to an alleged abuse of its market power.\nVestager is now readying for enforcement of the bloc\u2019s flagship Digital Markets Act \u2014 set to come into play on March 7. The sweeping new rules are intended to head off competition violations by tech firms before they take root.\nUnder the DMA, it will be illegal for the most powerful firms to favor their own services over those of rivals. They\u2019ll be barred from combining personal data across their different services, prohibited from using data they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them, and will have to allow users to download apps from rivals platforms.\n(Updates with details of the fine in France in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPlug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World\u2019s Biggest EV Market\nHow Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls\nUS Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight\nThe Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Apple of overpaying Chief Executive Tim Cook and other top executives by tens of millions of dollars by miscalculating the value of performance-based stock awards.\nU.S. District Judge Jennifer Rochon in Manhattan said the iPhone maker described its pay methods in detailed compensation tables in its 2023 proxy statement, \"precisely\" as securities laws and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require.\nRochon also found no proof that Apple's board of directors acted improperly in awarding pay, and said the plaintiff, a pension fund affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, did not give the board enough time to consider its objections before suing.\nLawyers for the pension fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe plaintiff said Apple in 2021 and 2022 awarded a respective $92.7 million and $94 million of performance-based restricted stock units to Cook and four other executives, though its compensation committee intended to award just $77.5 million each year.\nIt attributed the alleged error to the committee's improper calculation of the RSUs' fair values at the time of the grants, and said it misled shareholders who would be casting advisory votes on executive compensation, known as \"say-on-pay.\"\nCook's compensation totaled about $99 million in both 2021 and 2022, including more than $82 million of stock awards each year, Apple proxy filings show.\nHis total pay declined to $63.2 million for 2023.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta\u2019s (META) Mark Zuckerberg got his hands on Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Vision Pro and, perhaps unsurprisingly, he\u2019s not all that impressed. In an Instagram Reel posted Tuesday evening, the social media CEO sized up Apple\u2019s headset against Meta\u2019s own Quest 3 and came to the conclusion that \u201cthe Quest is the better product, period.\u201d\nZuckerberg\u2019s post, which he largely filmed using the Quest 3, comes as Apple\u2019s Vision Pro approaches its second week on the market. The $3,499 \u201cspatial computer\u201d quickly went viral as videos and photos of people using it bounced across social media.\nAll of the hype leading into the Vision Pro\u2019s launch seemingly irked Zuckerberg, who has funneled billions into Meta\u2019s efforts to take VR/AR headsets mainstream and jumpstart his vision for the metaverse, a series of interconnected online worlds.\nIn his review of the Vision Pro, Zuckerberg calls out a handful of differences between the devices, chief among them their prices. Apple\u2019s Vision Pro is priced well beyond the average consumer electronics product. At $499, the Quest 3 isn\u2019t exactly cheap, though it does come closer to what you\u2019d spend on a modern game console or laptop than Apple\u2019s offering.\nZuckerberg also needled the Vision Pro for requiring a wired external battery pack and said the Quest is more comfortable and has a wider field of view and brighter display.\n\u201cI was surprised by how many tradeoffs [Apple] had to make to the quality of the device,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for.\u201d\nZuckerberg also spoke to the broader ecosystems powering the headsets, touching on Apple\u2019s closed-off operating system compared to Meta\u2019s more open approach, saying he wants to see an open approach win out.\nFor what it's worth, I've used both the Quest 3 and Vision Pro and found the Vision Pro to be easier to navigate and quite comfortable. Its display was also a standout, offering impressive clarity compared to the Quest 3.\nIt makes sense for Zuckerberg to promote his product. But critiquing Apple\u2019s Vision Pro is an unusual step among tech CEOs.\n\u201cI think one of the reasons for anyone to do what he did is to keep up that hype, keep up that momentum, because this market surely needs that,\u201d explained Gartner director and analyst Tuong Nguyen. \u201cKeep people interested, and what better way to keep them interested than shots fired.\u201d\nAccording to Nguyen, Zuckerberg\u2019s battle with Apple is a good thing because it means increased competition, which should ultimately benefit consumers.\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind that Apple could address Zuckerberg\u2019s criticisms with the next version of the Vision Pro, explained IDC research director Ramon Llamas.\n\u201cLet's come back in a year, let's come back in two years, and let's see how that story changes,\u201d he said.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Zuckerberg and Apple have butted heads. Heck, it\u2019s not the first time the CEO has used his social platform to tangle with another Big Tech executive. You\u2019ll recall the billionaire was previously set to fight Tesla CEO Elon Musk after the X owner challenged Zuckerberg to an MMA match in 2023.\nBut his disdain for Apple runs deeper than playground antics.\nApple kneecapped Meta\u2019s ad business with the release of its App Tracking Transparency feature in 2021. The software update gave iPhone users the ability to keep apps from tracking their movement across the web and other apps, cutting into a key piece of Meta\u2019s data stream, which helps power its advertising sales.\nMeta has also criticized Apple for its so-called walled garden-style operating system that gives the iPhone maker ultimate control over what kind of apps and software users can install on their devices.\nHowever Zuckerberg feels about Apple\u2019s Vision Pro, though, the headset war will ultimately come down to device sales. And if the Vision Pro can beat the Quest 3 there, the CEO\u2019s opinions won\u2019t matter all that much.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": " Dylan Croll    \u00b7 Markets Reporter",
        "Text": "Once upon a time, believe it or not, no one particularly looked forward to Super Bowl ads.\nThat all changed when Washington faced Los Angeles on Jan. 22, 1984, in Tampa, Fla. Those who tuned in to the big game on CBS \u2014 and hadn\u2019t fled to the kitchen for snacks \u2014 found themselves watching something completely different.\nIn between ads for Gillette Foamy Gel and Northwestern Mutual insurance, a dystopian scene appeared on their TV sets: A line of men wearing faded gray apparel marched mindlessly into a theater, where a bespectacled face, \u201cBig Brother,\u201d addressed them on a massive screen.\nExtolling the virtues of groupthink, Big Brother celebrated freedom from \u201cpests of any contradictory true thoughts.\u201d\nThen, the camera cut to a striking blond athlete running in slow motion.\nWearing a white tank top and red shorts \u2014 and played by British discus thrower and actress Anya Rajah (then Anya Major) \u2014 she strode into the theater, with guards in close pursuit. She spun and, with a shout, hurled a sledgehammer at Big Brother\u2019s face. As the screen exploded, large text appeared along with a voice narrating, \u201cOn January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you\u2019ll see why 1984 won\u2019t be like '1984.'\u201d\nHappy 40th to one of the greatest ads, Super Bowl or otherwise, of all time.\nCreated by the ad agency Chiat/Day and Apple (AAPL), \u201c1984\u201d elevated Super Bowl ads to a whole new level. Today, tech historians, ad pros, and techies alike all look back at the commercial not only as a seminal moment in the democratization of personal computing and Super Bowl advertisements, but as a work of art containing themes that still resonate today.\nThough Rob Schwartz, an advertising industry leader who ran Chiat/Day from January 2015 to April 2021, was not at the agency when the ad was created, he still still remembers feeling inspired by it when it aired. \u201cIt marked the first time that the commercials in the Super Bowl were going to be something else to watch besides the game itself. This marked the moment,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance recently.\n\u201cIt was,\u201d he added, \u201cthe first time where the audience went, \u2018Wait, wait, wait, don't go to the bathroom. Let's stay and watch a few commercials before the game comes back.'\"\nBut Apple, the Super Bowl aside, was in need of a boost.\nIBM = Big Brother?\nIn the early 1980s, the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II.\u00a0In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible, it had then developed the Lisa,\u00a0named after Steve Jobs\u2019 daughter. Though innovative, the computer had sold poorly, especially compared to IBM\u2019s (IBM) PC, which was released in 1981. Meanwhile, Apple had begun working on the Macintosh, which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses.\n\u201cApple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market, and needing a new big hit \u2026 the company had bet it all on the Macintosh, spending huge on its R&D, building a new state-of-the-art factory for it,\u201d said Margaret O'Mara, the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington.\nBut then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product. Steve Hayden, now 76, then a copywriter at Chiat/Day, still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly. The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to \u201cstop the world in its tracks\u201d and entrusted the L.A.-based firm with the job.\nAlong with art director Brent Thomas, Hayden began brainstorming. He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline \"Why 1984 won't be like '1984,'\" a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick. At first, Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 \u201clike the Jetsons.\u201d But the ad\u2019s director, a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott, had a better idea.\n\u201cHe came and looked at our initial board \u2026 he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis,\u00a0the movie, and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies,\u201d Hayden explained. \u201cAnd so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision.\u201d\nThe advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another, a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and \"break the spell,\" Hayden said.\nA new age\nThe heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother. As historian O\u2019Mara pointed out, the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. \u201cI think it's telling that she's dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if she's running for the United States,\" she said.\nThe heroine also represented the Macintosh. While computers had previously been monopolized by experts \u2014 think mainframes and IBM \u2014\u00a0the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market.\n\u201cShe was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age, and therefore, Macintosh,\u201d Hayden said.\nAdded Chiat/Day\u2019s Schwartz: \u201cYou have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business \u2026 When she throws that sledgehammer, she is all of us \u2026 and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship, even if it's just a dictator for a day, we don't want that. We want to be free. And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it, 40 years later.\u201d\nBut there were some naysayers within the company. Apple's board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing. Meanwhile, Hayden himself felt unsure about his work. \u201cI had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn't match the traditional advertising forms.\u201d\nBut Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, now 79, who was then running Apple France, still recalls\u00a0the first time he saw the ad at a 1983\u00a0meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh. \u201cWe had never seen advertising like this ... it was absolutely stunning. And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery, a Mac came down on a wire, and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones],\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo we could hear what became the highly recognizable \u201cbong\u201d of the Mac starting. There was this hysteria in the room.\u201d\nThough Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended \u201cBig Brother\u201d to represent IBM, Jobs quickly adopted that framing. After showing the ad, Jobs gave a \u201cfiery\u201d anti-IBM speech, \u201csaying that the Macintosh would change the world,\u201d according to Gass\u00e9e. \u201cIt was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images.\u201d\nHolding up\nIt is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up. Only this time, you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Elon Musk, Meta\u2019s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.\nAt least Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e sees it that way. He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and Google. It serves as \u201ca good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI think the ad presents two views of technology. One that is Big Brother-like, oppressive, and one which is the Macintosh, a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology.\u201d he said. \u201cSo this ad in 1983, 1984, presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology. I think that that conflict is still alive.\u201d\nEnjoy the Super Bowl.\nDylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.\n"

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the quarter we're reporting today included 13 weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations.\nThese statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year.\nAnd I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device.\nThere is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\nNow, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SoS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact.\nTurning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game.\nA favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to-device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad.\niPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most.\nAnd for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continue to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses.\nWe're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher.\nTurning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world.\nWe also continue to do a central work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by core belief in the transformative power of innovation.\nAnd so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long-term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio.\nThanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.\nProducts gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia.\nOur iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and return to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago.\nCustomer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago.\nThis time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services.\nBoth transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Mac\u2019s, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work.\nIn emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000 plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come.\nLet me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter.\nAs we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year.\nWhen we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSee also 15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World and 40 Richest Countries in the World by Per Capita Net Worth.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n"

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway on Wednesday said it has trimmed its huge stake in Apple and shed four common stock holdings, and kept investors guessing on what could be a major new investment by Warren Buffett.\nIn a regulatory filing describing its U.S.-listed stock holdings at the end of 2023, Berkshire said it sold 10 million Apple shares in the fourth quarter, but still owned more than 905 million shares worth about $174 billion.\nThough Buffett has been driving Berkshire's investment in Apple, the stock sales in the iPhone maker could have been made by one of his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who oversee some Berkshire investments.\nBerkshire reported no holdings in homebuilder DR Horton, insurer Globe Life, insurance and investment company Markel and Brazilian credit card processor StoneCo, after holding more than $1 billion of those stocks at the end of September.\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also boosted its stake in oil company Chevron, one of its biggest holdings, and reduced its stakes in computer and printer maker HP and media company Paramount Global.\nFor a second straight quarter, Berkshire obtained permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to temporarily keep one or more of its holdings confidential.\nIt occasionally requests such treatment when it is making big investments, including multibillion-dollar stakes in Chevron, Exxon Mobil, IBM and Verizon Communications.\nThis is because investors often try to piggyback on what Berkshire does, reflecting Buffett's reputation as one of the world's greatest investors. Berkshire prefers not to have investors pile into its stocks before it's done buying.\nIn its third-quarter report in November, Berkshire hinted that its confidential investment may involve a bank, finance company or insurer because it had recently spent $1.2 billion on stock in that sector. It has yet to reveal where the money went.\nBerkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It no longer invests in Exxon, IBM and Verizon.\nBuffett, 93, has run Berkshire since 1965.\nThe conglomerate also owns dozens of businesses including the Geico car insurer, BNSF railroad, energy and industrial companies, and consumer brands such as Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies.\nIt also owns the Pilot truck stop chain, after buying the 20% it didn't already own from the billionaire Haslam family in January.\nBerkshire will reveal more about its investing and businesses when it releases its annual report and Buffett's annual letter to shareholders, expected on Feb. 24.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Diane Craft)\n"

It expects the March quarter\u2019s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis.

        "Title": "Time to Buy Apple or Amazon Stock After Earnings?",
        "Author": "  Shaun Pruitt ",
        "Text": "Over the weekend investors were certainly digesting the quarterly results from Magnificent Seven players Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0last Friday. \u00a0\nOf course, Meta Platforms\u2019 stood out by announcing its first-ever dividend during its earnings release but all three were able to exceed their top and bottom line expectations. While Meta may have stolen the show on Friday, let\u2019s check out Amazon and Apple\u2019s quarterly results and see if now is a good time to buy stock in these iconic tech giants.\nAmazon Q4 Review \nRounding out its fiscal 2023 Amazon reported Q4 earnings of $1.01 per share which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus of $0.81 a share by 24%. Even better, Q4 earnings soared 380% from $0.21 a share in the comparative quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $169.96 billion beat estimates by 2% and leaped 14% YoY. Amazon produced Q4 net income of $10.6 billion which skyrocketed from the $300 million the e-commerce bohemoth brought in a year ago.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon attributed its very strong Q4 results to a record-breaking holiday shopping season and saw 13% and 17% growth in its North America and International segment sales respectively. In terms of its cloud services, Amazon\u2019s AWS segment sales were up 13% to $24.2 billion during Q4 but slightly missed estimates of $24.37 billion.\nStill, Amazon\u2019s total sales were up 12% in FY23 to $574.8 billion with net income of $30.4 billion climb swinging from a net loss of -$2.7 billion a year ago. This translated into annual earnings of $2.90 per share which skyrocketed 308% from $0.71 a share in 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple Q1 Review\nReporting its fiscal first quarter results of Friday, Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings of $2.18 per share was up 16% YoY to a new record high and topped the Zacks Consensus of $2.09 a share by 4%. Quarterly sales of $119.57 billion topped estimates by over 1% and rose 2% YoY. Apple reported net income of $33.92 billion which jumped 13% from the prior year quarter.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple\u2019s Q1 growth was fueled by iPhone sales and an all-time revenue record in its Services segment sales which includes Apple news, music, and TV along with its App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, and Apple Pay. iPhone sales came in at $69.7 billion and beat estimates by 1% although Services sales of $23.11 billion were still -1% short of the consensus of $23.39 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nFollowing their favorable quarterly results Amazon\u2019s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Apple lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The trend of positive earnings estimate revisions looks likely to continue for Amazon while investors may want to monitor Apple\u2019s warning of softer iPhone sales during the current quarter despite the company's immense\u00a0probability.\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "How to Earn $500 Per Month From Apple Stock",
        "Author": "  Joey Solitro ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $188.08 at the end of trading on February 8. In the preceding 52 weeks, the stock price has fluctuated from $143.90 to $199.62.\nOn February 1, Apple reported its first quarter earnings results for the quarter ending December 30, 2023. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showed payments for dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.825 billion, up from $3.768 billion in the same period in 2022.\nBased on its current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, the annualized dividend for Apple is $0.96 per share. Using the stock price at the close on February 8, its dividend yield is about 0.51%.\nIf you have an earnings target of $500 per month or $6,000 annually from Apple's dividends, your investment value needs to be $1,176,471 which is 6,255 shares at $188.08 each. But if you reduce your earnings target to $100 per month, your investment value drops to $235,294 or 1,251 shares.\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\nHow to earn $500 Per Month In Passive Income Through Real Estate Without Becoming A Landlord\nHow to calculate your estimated value of investments using dividend yields: To calculate an estimated investment value, you need two critical variables \u2014 the desired annual earnings target ($6,000 or $1,200) and the dividend yield of the stock (0.51% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0051 = $1,176,471 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0051 = $235,294 for $100 per month.\nTo calculate the dividend yield, you need to divide the annual dividend payments by the stock\u2019s current price. It is important to note that a company's dividend yield may change over time. This is because of the fluctuations in stock prices and changes in dividend policies on a rolling basis. Assuming that the stock price does not fluctuate or the capital appreciation is not factored into the calculations, the dividend value and its yield are positively correlated.\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).\nDisclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on Feb. 8 using an annualized dividend. The price of Apple stock at the end of trading on Feb. 8 was $188.08.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\u00a0\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

        "Author": "  Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer and Martin Coulter ",
        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer and Martin Coulter\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple has won an exemption for its iMessage and Microsoft for its Bing search engine from new EU tech rules after the companies convinced antitrust regulators their services are not gateways for businesses to reach end-users.\nThe European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which takes effect in three weeks' time, requires Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Meta Platforms and ByteDance to allow third-party apps or app stores on their platforms and make it easier for people to switch to rivals.\nThe companies are also prohibited from favouring their services over rivals.\nFollowing a five-month investigation, the European Commission found iMessage, Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising \"did not qualify as gatekeeper services,\" the EU executive said in a statement.\nThe Commission said Apple's App Store, iOS operating system and Safari browser will continue to be classified as gatekeepers as will Microsoft's Linkedin social network and Windows operating system.\nIt made \"a thorough assessment of all arguments, taking into account input by relevant stakeholders\", the Commission said without providing details of the companies' arguments.\nApple had said iMessage usage is negligible, even on its devices, compared to rival messaging services in the EU and that iMessage is not an important channel for businesses to reach users in the bloc.\n\"Consumers today have access to a wide variety of messaging apps, and often use many at once, which reflects how easy it is to switch between them,\" an Apple spokesperson said.\nMicrosoft said that Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising operate as challengers in the market and are of relatively small scale, meaning they are not important gateways for business users.\n\"We will continue to engage with the Commission and industry at large to ensure Microsoft's other designated platforms comply fully with the DMA,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\nLazar Radic, an antitrust expert at the International Center for Law and Economics, said: \"It is a good sign that the Commission has considered market realities, instead of just slapping the 'gatekeeper' label on iMessage because it fulfills certain quantitative thresholds.\n\"This suggests the Commission is capable of avoiding the temptation to over-regulate.\"\nHowever, the Coalition for Open Digital Ecosystems (CODE), whose members include Google, Meta Platforms and Qualcomm, disagreed with the Commission's decision to exempt services such as iMessage.\n\"Today\u2019s surprising decision undermines the objectives of the DMA, as well as its potential to improve choice and contestability for all Europeans,\" it said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Bart Meijer and Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Barbara Lewis and Keith Weir)\n"

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -Meta Platforms said on Thursday that businesses purchasing a \"boost\" for their posts on the iOS versions of its social media apps Facebook and Instagram would need to pay an extra 30% service charge to app store operator Apple.\nAdvertisers will be able to boost their content on Instagram and Facebook via a browser without paying the Apple service charges, the social media giant said.\nApple had announced the updated App Store guidelines in 2022. Meta said it will start implementing the changes this month in the United States and that other markets will be subject to this fee later in the year.\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on whether there would be any material impact from the change.\n\"We are required to either comply with Apple's guidelines, or remove boosted posts from our apps,\" Meta said in a statement.\n\"We do not want to remove the ability to boost posts, as this would hurt small businesses by making the feature less discoverable and potentially deprive them of a valuable way to promote their business.\"\nAs part of the change, advertisers boosting posts on iOS will be billed by Apple, not Meta, and will be required to pay in advance rather than after the ads run.\nBoosted posts is a product offered by Meta to businesses looking to promote their content on apps like Facebook or Instagram, without requiring a campaign through Ads Manager, Meta's advertising tool that lets brands buy and create ads.\n\"Boosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service - so of course In-App Purchase is required,\" Apple said in a statement. \"This has always been the case and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully.\"\nHowever, Apple said that Meta customers can still use a separate standalone app called \"Meta Ads Manager\" to pay for their ad campaigns without paying commissions to Apple because that separate app falls under an exemption for advertising campaign management apps.\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Maju Samuel and David Evans)\n"

        "Title": "Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain",
        "Author": "  Grahamites ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported first-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 1. According to the press release, the company posted revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2% year over year, and earnings of $2.18 per share, up 16%. The company highlighted that its services revenue reached a new all-time record and earnings reached a new all-time high as well. The installed base of Apple's active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all product and geographic segments. Overall, first-quarter earnings were in line with expectations. However, the stock was down a little bit the next day.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nThe company's services revenue grew 11.3% year over year. This is encouraging because it shows the growing power of Apple's iOS ecosystem. On the hardware side, both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories saw sales decline during the quarter. IPad sales declined 25.3%. CEO Tim Cook's explanation for this year-over-year decline during the earnings call was a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue declined 11.3%. Again, the decline was also due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Macbook sales were up 1% year over year. Cook remarked that this increase was driven by the strength of Apple's latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales.\nApple's most important business is obviously the iPhone, which accounted for 58.3% of revenue for the quarter. IPhone revenue grew 6% year over year, which was slower than the overall growth of the global smartphone market but faster than its biggest competitor Samsung (XKRX:005930).\nAccording to preliminary data from the International Data Corp. Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, global smartphone shipments declined 3.2% year over year to 1.17 billion units in 2023. The fourth quarter (4Q23) saw 8.5% year-over-year growth and 326.1 million shipments, higher than the forecast of 7.3% growth.\nThe iPhone's market share reached an all-time high and Apple surpassed Samsung to become the top player for the first time.\nThe iPhone obviously had a great quarter, but there is one big ominous sign Apple's revenue in China declined by double digits during the quarter.\nDuring the earnings call, the weaker performance in China was asked about a few times by various Wall Street analysts. Cook sounded optimistic about China in the long term, but it is almost guaranteed the iPhone will lose market share in China going forward because Huawei is back.\nHuawei's smartphone business was basically decimated after the U.S. sanctioned Huawai in 2019. According to Counterpoint Research Global Smartphone Tracker and Forecast, the company's market share declined from more than 30% to less than 6% in 2022.\nWhen the U.S. sanctioned Huawei, it looked like it was game over as the company could not get the high-end chips it needed to produce its smartphones. However, after more than four years of sanctions, Huawei miraculously came back and announced its high-end 5G Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro smartphones at the end of August. The two devices immediately became best-sellers in China after launch. This had an immediate impact on the iPhone's market share in China.\nAccording to Counterpoint's latest report on the Chinese market, Huawei's \"shipments soared 41% year over year in the third quarter of 2023 as its newly launched Mate 60 series with Kirin SoC gained momentum immediately after the launch. Apple also experienced a slight year over year uptick in shipments driven by the newly launched iPhone 15 series, but the initial supply constraints impacted its overall performance. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Apple's iPhone shipments in China dropped 2%, while Huawei's shipments increased by 36.20%.\nClearly, Huawei is taking market share from Apple in China since the launch of Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro. The challenge for Apple with Huawei's comeback is at least twofold. First of all, Huawei is very likely to continue to take market share from Apple in China in the foreseeable future. Second, Huawei might be able to take market share from Apple outside of China if its momentum can expand overseas. With Huawei's track record, I would not bet on Apple to maintain its worldwide market share going forward. If Apple cannot maintain its worldwide market share, then obviously Apple's fundamentals are likely to be impacted.\nApple's overall first-quarter earnings were very satisfactory. However, its business declined in China, which is its third-largest geographic market, mostly due to Huawei's launch of new high-end products. If Huawei is successful in its future product launches, Apple's China and global businesses may be adversely impacted. Investors should keep an eye on Huawei.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Major League Soccer: Apple deal 'set the bar at a different level'",
        "Author": " Alexandra Canal    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Watching an NFL season these days means viewers must subscribe to various streaming services in addition to a pricey cable package. That's not the case with professional US soccer.\nMajor League Soccer (MLS) said its desire to avoid what has become a fragmented viewing landscape for sports fans is what led it to sign an exclusive 10-year, $2.5 billion agreement with Apple (AAPL) in 2022.\n\"We think that the deal we did set the bar at a different level for people to think about how you do a partnership with a media company,\" Seth Bacon, executive vice president of media for MLS, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \"We're completely ingrained in Apple ecosystem with everything that we do. It's a true partnership.\"\nSo far the partnership appears to be paying off as sign-ups surge and viewership numbers skyrocket.\nApple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue said at a conference in November that each of the biggest MLS games last season attracted more than a million viewers on the service, noting \"no one expected that.\"\nThere's additional upside for Apple too. Matthew Ball, author of the bestselling book \"The Metaverse\" and former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, said in a new Stratechery podcast interview that Apple's MLS deal will likely amplify sales of the tech giant's new Vision Pro headset.\n\"There\u2019s a pretty good chance that in a few weeks or at least a year when [Lionel] Messi takes a free kick, I\u2019m going to get to be able to wander onto the field and stand right beside him at the box and watch or take the keeper\u2019s position,\" he predicted. \"And that I think is going to be remarkable and probably push this device in a way that we could never have imagined a year ago.\"\n\"When we started the process of reviewing our media rights at the end of 2017, we started to look down the road a little bit,\" Bacon said. \"We started to see that the world was going to look very different [and] that streaming was going to play a big part in it.\"\nThe league strategically consolidated all of its media rights about three years before the negotiation window for the rights opened. The goal? Create \"one big package\" to offer potential domestic partners.\nBacon explained the league, which kicked off its 2024 season last week, wanted to offer something \"completely different\" in the way games were distributed. That captured Apple's attention as it allowed the tech giant to control how it presented and delivered the game.\nAdditionally, the exclusive nature of the decades-long deal provided Apple the flexibility to fully invest in new concepts in order to deliver a more consistent fan experience.\nAs for MLS, the league knew Apple had the global distribution capabilities and would be able to amplify the brand on a much larger scale.\nOf course, it didn't hurt that Apple and MLS received a big boost from Argentine soccer legend Messi, who signed a historic MLS deal with Inter Miami in June.\nMessi's deal instantly led to a surge in ticket sales, sports apparel, and, most importantly, sign-ups to Apple's streaming package MLS Season Pass.\nSubscribers to the package \"over-delivered on expectations\" and have more than doubled since July, according to the league. Spanish language viewership has also surged, surpassing over 50% for Messi matches.\nAnalytics platform Antenna revealed that 110,000 users signed up for MLS Season Pass on the day of Messi's debut, representing a 280% increase from the number of sign-ups generated on the first day of the 2023 season. To note, Apple does not disclose subscriber figures.\nThe MLS partnership extends beyond just the live event games.\nEarlier this year, MLS and Apple announced an all-access docuseries, produced in partnership with Box to Box Films, the filmmakers behind Netflix's \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive.\"\nBacon said the docuseries is just the beginning given Apple's exposure to not only original content production but also music, podcasts, news, and fitness. The tech giant also just debuted a sports app that will provide users with real-time scores, betting lines, stats, and more.\n\"In the long haul, Apple is the place that we're pushing people,\" Bacon concluded. \"There's a huge amount of incentive for us and for our fans to lean into Apple and help grow the sport.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Despite fizzling interest in the metaverse, this isn't the first time a tech giant has delved into the VR sector. Vision Pro would be a competitor to tech giant Meta's (formerly Facebook) existing \"Meta Quest\" headset.\nVictoria VR's metaverse is driven by its VR token, which will reward its active users and stakers, the firm said. The token is based on Ethereum, under the blockchain's ERC-20 standard.\nHalf the revenue generated from in-game asset sales will be redistributed to stakers and active metaverse users.\n\"Victoria VR\u2019s in-app economy is fueled by the VR token, used to incentivize activities that enhance the virtual environment for the benefit of all participants,\" according to the press release.\nThe VR token has surged nearly 60% in the last 24 hours and has $103 million in market cap, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nAccording to a white paper posted on the project's website, \"We want Victoria VR to be accessible to all, and so citizens will be able to earn Victoria VR by simply taking part in the world.

        "Author": "  Rachyl Jones ",
        "Text": "Spotify CEO Daniel Ek ratcheted up his yearslong fight with Apple over its app store policies by accusing the company of skirting new EU requirements to fix the problem.\nEk had successfully pushed Europe\u2019s antitrust regulators to require that Apple let users download iOS apps from third party app stores. But on Tuesday, he complained that Apple\u2019s subsequent changes are \u201ca farce\u201d that continues to harm app developers.\n\u201cApple\u2019s stance is very much incongruent to our stance on the matter, and frankly, I think it\u2019s a bit of a farce,\u201d Ek said during Spotify\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday.\nTo comply with the EU\u2019s new rules, Apple recently introduced new terms for app purchases and downloads. While Apple is reducing its commission fee for in-app transactions\u2014from 30% to 17%, or 10% for small businesses\u2014it is tacking on additional charges. Developers who use the App Store\u2019s payment processing system will have to pay a 3% fee, and large developers will have to pay \u20ac0.50 ($0.54) every time a user downloads their app from an alternative app store.\nThis leaves music streaming giant Spotify in the same or a worse position than under Apple\u2019s old policy of charging developers a 30% commission on in-app purchases, Spotify said. App developers can choose whether they want to operate under the old rules or switch to the new ones, but those who adopt the new terms can never switch back.\n\u201cIt looks on the surface like they\u2019re complying with it,\u201d Ek said during the call about Apple complying with the new EU regulations. \u201cBut behind the surface, they\u2019re doing pretty much everything to make this such an unattractive experience that no sane developer would want to pick the new terms.\u201d\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nApple\u2019s policy changes and the new regulation, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), go into effect in March. During Apple\u2019s earnings call last week, CEO Tim Cook said predicting how consumers will react to the change is difficult, and that it\u2019s too early to know how the changes will impact the company\u2019s revenue. While Spotify says Apple\u2019s new policies circumvent the new rules, the European Commission will ultimately decide on the matter.\nAt the core of this feud is Spotify\u2019s bottom line. Over the past four quarters, it has reported a profit only once. Ek protested that some of his company\u2019s ideas to generate more revenue, like selling individual audiobooks, are undermined by Apple\u2019s excessive fees.\n\u201cApple insists on taking a 30% cut, which in many cases exceeds even our own cut,\u201d he said, adding that it limits \u201csome of these innovative things we would like to do.\u201d\nThe good news for Spotify investors is that Apple\u2019s policy changes result in no downside for Spotify\u2019s existing business, Ek said. Spotify can continue to operate under Apple\u2019s old terms. If the European Commission strictly enforces the DMA against Apple, though, the \u201cpotential upsides could be quite significant,\u201d he said.\nFor the most recent quarter, which ended Dec. 31, Spotify reported subscriber growth that beat analysts\u2019 expectations and revenue that fell slightly below. The company had 236 million paid subscribers, up 10 million from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, it generated $3.67 billion in revenue, or 16% year-over-year growth.\nInvestors cheered the news Tuesday morning, sending the stock soaring 9% before it retreated to a 4% gain, at $231.92.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

That will help them avoid an Apple commission that Meta said would take effect this month.\nApple\u2019s new policy requires advertisers to use its In-App Purchase feature whenever they pay to \u201cboost\u201d social media posts \u2014 a move that gives the content more exposure. Apple takes a cut of as much as 30% on app purchases in its iOS software, meaning that Meta will lose a portion of its ad revenue to the iPhone maker.\nThe policy change, first announced by Apple in 2022, ratcheted up tension between the tech giants, which have become two of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest adversaries in recent years. At the time, Meta accused the company of \u201cundercutting others in the digital economy.\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has also frequently criticized Apple for wielding too much control over its App Store.\nApple said Thursday that treating boosts as an In-App Purchase is consistent with its longstanding approach to the App Store. The company said it spent more than a year discussing the boosting policy with Meta, giving them ample time to comply.\n\u201cWe have always required that purchases of digital goods and services within apps must use In-App Purchase,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cBoosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service \u2014 so of course In-App Purchase is required. This has always been the case and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully.\u201d\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has been a vocal detractor of the privacy practices at Meta, which relies on user data to sell ads. Previous Apple changes have hit Meta in the pocketbook. In 2021, an iOS tweak that limited third-party data collection led to an estimated $10 billion loss in ad revenue for Meta.\nThe iPhone maker has drawn broader criticism for its policies, with companies like Spotify Technology SA and Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. saying App Store rules are unfair. The company recently overhauled its approach in Europe to comply with new regional legislation, though those changes have brought further outcry.\nApple\u2019s new policy takes effect in the US first, before rolling out to other countries later this year. The change will also require advertisers to pay for ads upfront when buying them through an iOS app. The change will largely affect Meta\u2019s smaller advertisers, some of whom use boosted posts as their only form of advertising, Meta said.\n(Updates with response from Apple in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures\nHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars\nPursuing \u2018American Dynamism,\u2019 Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC\nHow Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable\nToday\u2019s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "After Skyrocketing 615%, Why Does Warren Buffett Still Own Apple Stock?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Many people believe that Warren Buffett is the greatest investor ever. As the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has held many winning investments.\nPerhaps his most successful is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The conglomerate first started buying shares in the iPhone maker during the first quarter of 2016. And since the start of that year, shares have skyrocketed an incredible 615%.\nA whopping 45.7% of Berkshire's entire portfolio is represented by just Apple. With such a high weighting, coupled with a market cap of $2.9 trillion and a price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of 30.4, it forces one to wonder why the Oracle of Omaha still owns Apple today.\nI think there are four reasons why this might be the case.\nBuffett's investment strategy has long focused on finding outstanding businesses and aiming to hold them for a long time. In fact, his favorite holding period is forever.\nApple has the makings of a forever stock. Its incredibly powerful brand supports its economic moat. And because customers are also using the company's software and services more, Apple has an ecosystem that drives stickiness. These traits have helped support the business's financial success.\nThe added benefit of having an indefinite holding period is that it doesn't trigger a taxable event. This means compounding isn't interrupted unnecessarily.\nWhen picking stocks to invest in, the hope is that they can beat the market over the long term. Despite its huge market cap and premium valuation, Buffett might still believe that Apple has the potential to produce strong returns going forward.\nWith dividends reinvested, the S&P 500 has historically returned an average of about 10% per year. This is a difficult hurdle for most active managers to beat. But Buffett may think there is a high chance that Apple can outperform the broader index.\nIf this is the case, then there's absolutely no reason why he should sell, especially since he probably has expert knowledge about the business after owning it for all these years.\nBerkshire owns a 5.9% stake in Apple thanks to its holding of nearly 916 million shares. This massive position provides a financial windfall.\nApple pays a dividend that yields a measly 0.52%. But based on the current quarterly payout of $0.24, Buffett's firm receives an annualized $879 million from its equity position in the tech giant.\nApple uses the vast majority of its free cash flow to retire its outstanding stock. From the end of fiscal 2018 through the end of 2023, the business saw its share count shrink by 21%, a capital-allocation policy that increases Berkshire's ownership stake.\nIn this instance, it's very easy to come up with reasons for why Apple should be sold right now. But let's also consider the opportunity cost. If Buffett sold the entire position today, what would Berkshire do with the almost $170 billion in proceeds?\nThis sizable cash infusion would only exacerbate the conglomerate's problem. It already has $152 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury bills on the balance sheet, a sum that Buffett hasn't seemed to have had much use for in terms of finding compelling investments. He would likely have no idea what to do with more money that would come from selling Apple.\nThis tells me that even though a valid argument can be made that at its current size and expensive valuation it should be sold, Apple still provides a better potential return than just holding cash. This might be what Buffett is thinking.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Sold Nearly $2 Billion Worth of Apple Last Quarter. Here's Why.",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "CEO Warren Buffett called Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) \"a better business than any we own\" at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) annual shareholder meeting last May. The stock is, by far, the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, a sign of Buffett's conviction in the company. Yet the Oracle of Omaha decided to sell nearly $2 billion worth of Apple shares at the end of last year.\nBerkshire Hathaway held 10 million fewer Apple shares at the year's end than in September, according to the company's 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But investors shouldn't start worrying Buffett has soured on the tech titan. There's a clear explanation as to why Buffett sold some of his Apple stock.\nBuffett sold a lot of stocks in 2023. Through the first nine months of the year, Berkshire Hathaway sold $32.8 billion worth of stock (and bought just $9.1 billion).\nBuffett had plenty of good reasons for trimming some positions and exiting others entirely, but it's impossible to ignore the tax consequences of Buffett's sales.\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway reports deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains in its portfolio as a liability on its balance sheet, it doesn't actually have to pay those taxes until Buffett or one of the other investment managers at Berkshire sells shares and realizes a gain. As of the end of September, Berkshire's deferred tax liability was about $85 billion. It had $207 billion in net unrealized gains, and stock sales earlier in the year generated $5.4 billion in realized gains.\nBuffett continued selling in the fourth quarter. Two of the biggest sales were HP and Paramount Global.\nHe slashed 78% of Berkshire's remaining position in HP, a move Buffett started to make in the third quarter. That stock sale likely came with a hefty loss, as HP shares have declined in value since Buffett first established the position.\nBuffett cut one-third of Berkshire's position in Paramount. That represents another big loss from his initial stake established in 2022 when the stock traded above $30 per share.\nNeedless to say, Buffett's investments in these two companies didn't work out as expected. And he's not afraid to admit defeat when he's wrong or own up to a mistake. Plus, the sale of the two losing positions resulted in significant losses that can count against gains in Berkshire's portfolio.\nSo, in order to take advantage of the losses, Buffett looked to take gains on some of his winning positions. Apple is one of his biggest wins. So, it makes sense that he took just enough gains to offset the losses from other stock sales, resulting in a minimal net realized gain and a small tax bill as a consequence.\nThis isn't the first time Buffett's sold shares of Apple at the end of the year.\nHe sold shares at the end of 2018, 2019, and 2020, very likely taking gains each time. The sales were done purely for tax purposes. But Buffett said the decision to sell Apple shares was \"probably a mistake\" during Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting. When he asked Vice Chairman Charlie Munger if he thought it was a mistake, too, he simply replied, \"Yes!\"\nBuffett looked to correct his error by buying more Apple shares in 2022 as stock prices declined. Still, he missed out on significant gains by selling Apple. Shares reached a new all-time high last year.\nBuffett may have just repeated his mistake. That said, last quarter's sale isn't nearly as big as his sale in 2020. The 10 million shares he sold represent about 1% of Berkshire's total position. If it does turn out to be a mistake, it'll be a much smaller one. What's more, Buffett has an opportunity to buy back those Apple shares at a lower price, after the company's stock dropped to start the year.\nApple shares currently offer relatively good value. They trade at 27.8 times analysts' consensus estimate for 2024 earnings and just 25.5 times expected earnings in 2025. While that's a premium to the overall market, Apple shares arguably deserve a premium thanks to the generous capital return program and the $100 billion per year the company generates in free cash flow.\nThe important lesson for investors is that there are many reasons an investment manager might sell a stock. It doesn't necessarily mean they no longer like the company or they think it's not a good value. And in the case of Buffett's take on Apple, he's betting about $165 billion it's a great investment.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

Apple will then erase and reset it.\nThe issue is one of a few early customer-service snags surrounding the $3,499 device, which went on sale Friday. The company\u2019s support staff also has been fielding questions from users struggling to set up Optic ID \u2014 an eye-scanning tool for logging into the device \u2014 and the built-in Apple Music app.\nThe passcode problem could be particularly frustrating. When customers enter their passcode incorrectly too many times, the headset will be disabled. If users still can\u2019t recall their passcode after a waiting period, they\u2019ll need to send it back to Apple to be reset, according to guidance given to the company\u2019s support staff. At that point, all content on the device will be erased.\nIt\u2019s a quirk that doesn\u2019t exist with Apple\u2019s other products. The company\u2019s smartwatch, for instance, has a mechanism that lets users set it up again if a passcode is forgotten.\nIt\u2019s possible that Apple makes software changes in the near future that would allow the passcode to be reset without needing to send the product back. An Apple spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nOn Apple\u2019s community forum, one customer said he spoke to an agent who was flooded with calls about the problem. \u201cHe\u2019s had to deal with a lot of angry customers after telling them their only recourse is to return to the store,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cHe said Apple Support was really caught off guard by this and apologized for not being better prepared.\u201d\nOne complication with the Vision Pro is it doesn\u2019t have a USB-C port that lets users plug it into a Mac for troubleshooting. The company did release a special strap for developers to be able to attach the headset to a Mac last week, but that accessory costs about $300 and isn\u2019t meant for consumers.\nRead More: Apple Vision Pro Debut Brings New Shopping Experience\nThe Vision Pro is Apple\u2019s first major new hardware category since it began selling smartwatches almost a decade ago.

The technology for the micro-LED screens includes more bespoke Apple technologies to enable a brighter picture that more accurately reproduces colors.\nThe cancelation with AMS-Osram doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the new Apple Watch was nixed. Instead, Apple is likely relying on multiple other suppliers as AMS-Osram was only a small player in the overall product development, a person with knowledge of the matter said.\nAMS-Osram executives declined to identify the client. A spokesperson for Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAMS-Osram has invested heavily in the micro-LED space. The company committed \u20ac800 million in 2022 to expand its manufacturing facility in Kulim to produce micro-LED displays. It had expected its first revenue from the technology in 2025.\nDevelopment, however, has taken longer than expected. According to an August report by Taipei-based research firm TrendForce, the rollout of micro-LED on the Apple Watch was pushed back to 2026 from 2025.\nShares tumbled as much as 45% in Zurich to 1.21 Swiss francs, the lowest since its 2009 initial public offering. Aixtron SE, which supplies chipmaking equipment to AMS-Osram, slumped as much as 22%, also weighed down by results that showed a worse-than-expected operating margin outlook and lacked any guidance on orders.\nAMS-Osram will incur an impairment charge of \u20ac600 million ($651 million) to \u20ac900 million in the current quarter as it reviews the value of assets linked to the project involving micro-LED technology, it said in a statement on Wednesday. It cut its guidance for medium-term sales growth to as much as 8% from 10%.\nThe firm\u2019s business struggles were exacerbated by a downturn in the semiconductor industry and a slowdown in consumer device demand. The debt-laden firm has been in a turnaround process, with \u20ac2.25 billion raised in a refinancing plan completed in December. Both Kamper and Chief Financial Officer Rainer Irle assumed their roles less than a year ago.\n\u201cWith this project now canceled, we believe that the shares will take a major hit as long-term growth prospects will be much lower without the micro LED opportunity,\u201d said Stifel analyst Juergen Wagner, referring to AMS-Osram.\nBond Drop\nAMS-Osram\u2019s bonds also took a beating on the news, with a \u20ac625 million 10.5% bond maturing in March 2029 dropping 8 cents on the euro to a cash price of 102.6 cents, according to Bloomberg pricing source CBBT at 11:20 a.m. London.\nA zero-coupon convertible bond maturing in March 2025 also fell by 3 cents, to a cash price of 92.5 cents on the euro.\nThis convertible bond was issued in the low-rate era in 2018, when many technology-related firms were able to essentially get free debt in exchange for exposure to their stock. Since rates have risen, many of these bonds have tumbled as the underlying stocks have cratered.\nIn the case of AMS-Osram, these convertible bonds were designed to convert into shares at \u20ac50.1886 upon maturity in 2025. This is a nearly 3,000% premium to the current share price.\n--With assistance from Allegra Catelli, Alexey Anishchuk and Mark Gurman.\n(Updates with details on Apple product plans.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace\nImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market\u2019s Need for Workers\nWhy Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman\nPrivate Equity\u2019s Green Star Started It All With a Database\nNvidia Is the Latest Shiny Object to Spur Stocks to New Heights\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Foreign executives often opt for low-key visits to Taiwan so as to avoid a reaction from China, which claims the island as part of its territory.\nWilliams is among Apple\u2019s most senior executives under CEO Tim Cook, who hasn\u2019t visited Taiwan in an official capacity in more than a decade of leading the company. Cook makes regular trips to China, which hosts Apple\u2019s key production base and is one of the firm\u2019s largest markets. But he\u2019s mostly avoided Taiwan, and he last made a public appearance on the island in 2008 for Foxconn founder Terry Gou\u2019s wedding.\nRepresentatives for Apple, SoftBank and Arm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nAlso known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Foxconn is a mainstay in Apple\u2019s production and assembly chain, helping to navigate challenges like the logistics and supply snarls caused by the pandemic. Apple has leaned on Foxconn and other Taiwanese partners more recently to shift some iPhone assembly to India, as it grapples with how to diversify its supply chain in the face of escalating US tech restrictions on China.\nSoftBank\u2019s Son and Foxconn\u2019s Gou have been longtime business partners.

        "Text": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.\nWhile each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.\nWhether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.\nApple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.\nBoth Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.\nBut most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.\nI find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.\nSince SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.\nConsidering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The late Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., not only transformed technology but also became an icon himself, partly because of his signature look \u2014 a black turtleneck, Levi\u2019s 501 jeans and New Balance sneakers. His distinctive style has its origins in a story that intertwines Jobs\u2019s admiration for Japanese design and his relationship with fashion designer Issey Miyake.\nJobs\u2019s visit to Sony Group Corp. in the 1980s sparked the idea of creating a uniform for Apple employees. In Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of Jobs, this moment is captured with a detailed account of how Jobs was inspired by the uniformity and sense of belonging among Sony\u2019s workers, leading him to pursue a similar vision for Apple.\nDon't Miss:\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban\u2019s startup investment strategy according to his colorful portfolio.\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\n\u201cHe looked very ashamed and told me that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day,\u201d Jobs said of then Sony Chairman Akio Morita.\nAccording to the biography, the Sony uniform was a taupe nylon jacket, distinguished by its innovative and functional design, which features a standout characteristic: The sleeves can be detached from the shoulders with a zipper, transforming the garment into a sleek vest.\nMotivated by this concept, Jobs reached out to Miyake, hoping to instill a similar sense of identity at Apple.\n\u201cI decided that I wanted that type of bonding for Apple,\" Jobs said. \"So I called Issey and asked him to design a vest for Apple. I came back with some samples and told everyone it would be great if we would all wear these vests. Oh man, did I get booed off the stage. Everybody hated the idea.\"\nTrending: Average retirement income in America has been revealed \u2013 Will you make enough each month?\nAlthough the idea of an Apple uniform was not embraced by employees, it opened a new chapter in Jobs\u2019s style and his friendship with Miyake. Despite the initial rejection, Jobs found a personal uniform that suited him, saying, \u201cSo I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them.\u201d\nJobs\u2019 choice of a personal uniform was more than a fashion statement; it was a reflection of his approach to work and life. The simplicity and consistency of his attire mirrored his philosophy of focusing on what truly mattered. By eliminating the daily decision of what to wear, Jobs could concentrate more on his work and the innovative endeavors at Apple.\nWhen Jobs died in 2011, he left behind a world transformed by his vision. His influence continues to resonate, not just in the products Apple creates but in the way people think about technology and its role in their lives. Jobs\u2019s story \u2014 a blend of innovation, personal branding and unconventional thinking \u2014 is a lasting inspiration for future generations. His distinct personal uniform was a visual reminder of his commitment to challenging the status quo and making a mark on the world.\nRead Next:\nHarvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.\nIf the average American household is a millionaire, why do people feel so broke?\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Steve Jobs Wanted Apple Employees To 'Bond' By Wearing A Uniform So He Had A Vest Designed For Them \u2014 'Oh Man, Did I Get Booed Off The Stage.

        "Author": "  Lionel Lim ",
        "Text": "Both Xiaomi and its founder, Lei Jun, are big fans of Apple. The Chinese smartphone maker embraces Apple-like designs in its products and advertising, leading some to dub the company \"the Apple of China.\" And Lei cites Steve Jobs as an inspiration, saying that the 1984 book Fire in the Valley put him on the path to launching his own company.\nAnd so it wasn't a big surprise when, in March 2021, Xiaomi announced it was entering the EV space, following Apple's 2014 decision to explore building a car. At the time, Xiaomi promised to spend $10 billion over 10 years to eventually offer \"quality smart electric vehicles.\"\nBut now Apple's car plans are reportedly dead, with the U.S. tech company shifting personnel to AI projects instead.\nThe man behind the \"Apple of China\" said he was \"shocked\" by Apple's decision, in a Wednesday post on Chinese social media platform Weibo. He continued that Xiaomi made a \"strategic choice\" to invest in EVs, and that the company remains committed to the project, despite the difficulty.\nIn December, Lei told state broadcaster CCTV that Xiaomi devoted 3,400 engineers and 10 billion Chinese renminbi ($1.4 billion) towards the company's first prototype vehicle. He noted that the overall investment was 10 times higher than what automakers generally devote to new models.\nXiaomi can break into the car market because EVs combine elements of both traditional automobiles and consumer electronics, Lei said at the time.\nThe smartphone maker unveiled its first EV, the SU7 electric sedan, in late December. The car made its first public appearance at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week.\nDomestic deliveries could start as soon as the second quarter of the year, Xiaomi group president Weibing Lu told CNBC. The company hasn't revealed a price tag yet, but Lu said a formal release would come \"very soon.\" The company is targeting the premium market, which Lu described as a good starting point due to Xiaomi's experience selling smartphones to \"20 million premium users.\"\nChinese consumers adopted EVs at a rapid pace in recent years, helping companies like BYD and Li Auto generate record-high sales. But Xiaomi will be trying to enter the world's largest EV market right as the pace of growth starts to slow down, and as other EV makers get bogged down in fierce price wars to capture more market share.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "A working parent\u2019s review of the Apple Vision Pro",
        "Author": "  Dave Smith ",
        "Text": "I drove four hours over an international border and dropped nearly five grand to buy Apple\u2019s exorbitant first-generation headset.\nAm I crazy? Yes. But that\u2019s partly because I\u2019m also a working parent.\nYou\u2019ll find plenty of reviews out there from Apple enthusiasts and tech-heads breaking down the Vision Pro every which way to Sunday. Those reviews are valuable, absolutely. But I wanted to offer a review from the perspective of a dad who spends 90% of his day either working or spending time with his kid. I imagine there are many out there like me\u2014maybe even you.\nLet me highlight a recent instance where Apple Vision Pro really came in handy for me personally.\nIt\u2019s 2:30 a.m. on a Wednesday and I\u2019m waiting for my one-year-old son to fall asleep.I\u2019ve been in and out of his room all night\u2014picking him up, holding him until he falls asleep, and slowly placing him back into his crib. But sure enough, he wakes back up every time. I won\u2019t sleep until he does, so I retrieve the high-tech headset that\u2019s been perched on my office desk, away from the curious hands of my recently-mobile-but-now-extremely-mobile toddler, and return to my living room. I connect the headset to the battery pack, and wait 30 seconds or so for Apple\u2019s Vision Pro to activate.\nAfter a few moments, I see a digital keypad with a grid of numbers floating in the middle of my living room\u2014like if the Ghost of Christmas Past were a calculator. I enter my password by looking at the numbers I want and tapping my fingers together. Apple Vision Pro is the first computer I\u2019ve ever tried where I am the cursor. In practice, it feels like telekinesis.\nThen, with a couple of quick motions\u2014a click and a twist of the \u201cdigital crown\u201d atop the headset\u2014I\u2019m no longer in my living room. I no longer see my TV, or my plants, or any of my furniture.I see craters, and rocks, and the clearest, most beautiful view of our stars I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI\u2019m on the moon.\nAt no point does it feel like I\u2019m looking at a picture\u2014or through a pair of ultra-dense displays surrounded by sensors and cameras, which I am. It feels like I\u2019m really there. Here's a short video I recorded of what it looks like:\nThe effect washes over me instantly. I\u2019m no longer thinking about my lack of sleep tonight, or how difficult work is going to be tomorrow as a result. This simulated view of the cosmos is so convincing, I\u2019m instantly transported out of my current situation and back to those summer nights at sleep-away camp in upstate New York\u2014far enough from the lights and pollution of nearby cities to give you a stellar view of the stars on most nights.\nThe best part? It\u2019s quick and easy to enter and exit this virtual world. When my baby cries, I simply twist the digital crown atop the headset and I\u2019m back in my living room. I can check to make sure he\u2019s safe, even while still donning the headset\u2014and, when I\u2019m ready, I can twist the crown again to re-deploy those starry skies.\nIt\u2019s these moments where I\u2019m really not thinking about how much I spent on this headset. (For the record, nearly $5,000 after taxes and insurance, which you totally need if you buy this thing). Frankly, I\u2019m not really thinking about anything at all. I embrace the stillness of the moon, and feel at peace.\nLike many parents, I love immersive entertainment. After working all day, and chasing my toddler before and after said work, I like to unwind by escaping reality as much as possible. Usually, that means digging into a TV show or movie with my wife, or playing a video game. But Apple Vision Pro, so far, has delivered the most immersive entertainment I\u2019ve ever experienced.\nThis headset has tricked my brain into all sorts of wild scenarios so far: that I\u2019m standing on top of a mountain, or alone in the desert, or in front of Alicia Keys as she rehearses with her band (my favorite). I\u2019ve gotten up close and personal with rhinos, dinosaurs, and T-Pain. And it all feels real.\nIt\u2019s also breathed new life into movies I\u2019ve seen countless times: Notably, I watched Avengers: Infinity War in 3D, on the moon, the biggest and brightest screen I\u2019ve ever seen. I was blown away. 3D experiences are where the Vision Pro truly shines.\nBut the best thing I\u2019ve done on Apple\u2019s first-generation Vision Pro so far is film 3D home movies.\nApple Vision Pro has cameras pointing at your eyes to optimize visuals and detect what you want to do\u2014but it also has cameras pointing outside so you can see your real-world surroundings. These same outward-facing cameras let you record 3D photos and videos which, when you watch them later, really feel like you\u2019re experiencing them again for the first time.\nThe depth effect of these 3D movies is not only convincing, it\u2019s emotional. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve re-watched videos of my son running into my arms for a hug, or my wife and I feeding him in his high chair. It tugs at my heartstrings, if I can be honest\u2014reliving these memories and knowing how fragile and temporary they are. Soon, my son will change: He\u2019ll be a boy, then a teen, then a man. But here, in this headset, I can see my baby, just as he looks now, forever and always.\nSurprisingly, capturing all of these 3D movies hasn\u2019t taken up much storage. On the contrary, my multimedia library only comprises about 10% of the 512 GB of storage on this device (you can buy it in 256 GB and 1 TB varieties, but this was the sweet spot for me). And, to be clear, I have a ton of multimedia content: over 9,000 photos, 1,000 videos, and a dozen \u201cspatial videos\u201d so far. (Worth noting: A 3-minute spatial video shot with Vision Pro is about 1 GB of space, but most of my videos come in around 30 seconds, which means each video is about 100 MB. I\u2019ll be able to store plenty of memories in this thing.)\nApple Vision Pro isn\u2019t perfect. Sometimes, it feels like there isn\u2019t enough to do: not enough apps, not enough immersive content from Apple or third parties, and not enough features. Passthrough\u2014the ability to see your real-life surroundings\u2014needs to be sharper and more colorful. The field of view could be wider, and there should be more unique interactions with other Apple devices. I wish, for instance, this thing came with Find My iPhone so it could direct me to my misplaced iDevices in a cool 3D way. (I can\u2019t tell you how annoying it is looking for your missing iPhone while wearing this thing.)\nVision Pro also needs to be much better at work. It only really excels as a mirror for my MacBook display. I use my laptop\u2019s keyboard, while the Vision Pro provides a massive digital screen that can be manipulated by pinching and pulling the air. It\u2019s fun! But you really don\u2019t want to use Vision Pro for work unless you own a MacBook, or a physical Bluetooth keyboard.\nTyping with only Vision Pro means using a single finger to select letters on a virtual keyboard, or focusing on each individual letter and typing it by tapping your fingers\u2014both methods are painfully slow and prone to mistakes. So if you\u2019re a working parent but are considering a Vision Pro for the work side of your life, just be sure you have a MacBook or physical Bluetooth keyboard handy. (I once tried writing a 250-word article with just the Vision Pro; it took almost two hours just to get the words out. Oof.)\nAs a busy dad, there also just aren\u2019t many occasions where wearing the headset is appropriate. If I wear it during the work day, I have to take it off at least 15 minutes in advance of meetings since it leaves goofy red marks on my face and head. When I\u2019m spending time with my wife and son at night, the headset can also be a distraction rather than a tool. People aren\u2019t accustomed to headsets like this being \u201cnormal\u201d just yet, so I\u2019ve gotten some looks from friends and family when I take it out\u2014even when the spatial videos I film are incredible to watch later.\nThere\u2019s a lot of room to grow for Apple Vision Pro. But as Casey Neistat points out, this is the worst Apple Vision Pro will ever be: issues will be ironed out, features will be introduced and iterated upon, and more content will be available. I understand many people have returned their Vision Pros for various reasons, but I have no plans to return mine. As a working parent, I have limited time, and the time I do spend inside this device feels novel\u2014and worth it.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Blake Brittain ",
        "Text": "By Blake Brittain\nWASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear patent-licensing company VirnetX's bid to revive a $502.8 million jury verdict it won against Apple in a dispute over internet-security patents.\nThe justices turned away Zephyr Cove, Nevada-based VirnetX's appeal of a lower court's decision to overturn the verdict against Cupertino, California-based Apple that had been reached by a jury in Tyler, Texas. VirnetX had challenged the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's decisions to invalidate its patents.\nApple and VirnetX have waged a 14-year-long court battle over VirnetX's internet-security patents that has included several trials and appeals.\nThe jury awarded VirnetX $502.8 million in 2020 after a separate jury determined that Apple's iPhones and iPads infringed patents related to virtual private networks.\nThe patent office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board allows petitioners to challenge the validity of specific patents. The process, known as inter partes review (IPR), is often used by big tech companies that are frequently targeted with patent lawsuits to contest patents they are accused of infringing.\nThe board rejected Apple's requests to invalidate the patents under the IPR process after it found that Apple had waited too long to file its petitions. The board later declared the patents invalid based on separate requests from hedge fund Mangrove Partners in cases that Apple was allowed to join.\nThe patent-focused U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the decisions to invalidate the patents and overturned the verdict last year. VirnetX had told the Supreme Court that letting the rulings stand would incentivize the \"harassment\" of patent owners at the board.\n\"A veritable cottage industry has sprung up,\" VirnetX said. \"Entities with no discernable stake file IPR petitions challenging patents successfully asserted in litigation - only for well-heeled but time-barred infringement defendants to conveniently join the proceedings and shoulder the cost.\"\nVirnetX cited a patent board case in which patent office director Kathi Vidal imposed sanctions on an entity called OpenSky Industries for attempting to extort both sides in a multi-billion-dollar dispute between Intel and patent owner VLSI Technology. Vidal removed OpenSky from the case based on its misconduct, and the tribunal allowed the challenge to a VLSI patent to continue with Intel leading it.\nVirnetX also argued that former patent office interim director Drew Hirshfeld, who presided before Vidal was appointed, exceeded his authority by denying VirnetX's requests for director review of the decisions.\nApple and Mangrove responded that VirnetX's arguments were not supported by applicable federal law. President Joe Biden's administration, representing the patent office, also urged the justices to reject the case.\nVirnetX previously won $440 million from Apple based on a 2016 verdict that the tech giant used its security technology in features like FaceTime video calls.

        "Title": "Chinese start-up EmdoorVR counts on Apple Vision Pro lookalike to break into consumer headset market",
        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "People in most parts of the world have yet to get their hands on Apple's Vision Pro, the tech giant's first mixed-reality headset that launched exclusively in the US earlier this month. But in the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen, sellers are already offering much cheaper alternatives.\nOne of them is the Vision SE, made by Shenzhen-based headset maker EmdoorVR. CEO Shi Qing said the company was hoping to leverage the interest around Apple's Vision Pro to survive a slowdown in the virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) industry.\n\"We did not want to miss the Apple Vision Pro opportunity, so we rode the wave and made something similar,\" he said.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nFrom its white straps and curved front screen down to its name, the Vision SE shows remarkable similarities with Apple's headset. Yet, their functionality and prices are starkly different.\nA customer tests a Vision Pro headset at an Apple store in Palo Alto, California. Photo: Bloomberg alt=A customer tests a Vision Pro headset at an Apple store in Palo Alto, California. Photo: Bloomberg>\nFor less than 2,000 yuan (US$280), the Vision SE lets users view videos, web pages and workplace apps in a VR and AR environment through its 5.5-inch LCD display that has 3664 x 1920 pixels combined.\nBut the device, powered by Qualcomm's entry-level AR and VR processor Snapdragon XR1, lacks the eye tracking and hand-gesture interaction experience offered by the Apple Vision Pro, which has a starting price of US$3,499 and costs twice as much in China's grey market.\nWhile Apple's device dives into the new concept of spatial computing, Emdoor's Vision SE focuses more on providing an entertainment experience, according to Shi.\nShi said he recognised the two devices' resemblance, which has earned the Vision SE the nickname \"Huaqiangbei Vision Pro\" on social media, after the famed consumer electronics market in Shenzhen that is known for selling knock-off gadgets.\nShi stressed that the company had filed for relevant patents and undergone auditing to avoid legal risks.\nThe devices from EmdoorVR and Apple arrived after a rocky year for the AR and VR industry, which saw global shipments decline 8.3 per cent to 8.1 million units in 2023, research firm IDC estimated in December. Demand was curtailed by macroeconomic pressures on both consumers and businesses, according to that report.\nIn China, Pico, the world's second-largest VR brand and a subsidiary of TikTok owner ByteDance, conducted at least two rounds of lay-offs last year, affecting hundreds of employees. The VR arm of video-streaming site iQiyi delayed salary payments and reduced headcount, according to a report by Chinese media outlet Caixin last April.\nVisitors tried out the EmdoorVR Vision SE headset at the CES electronics expo in Las Vegas last month. Photo: Handout alt=Visitors tried out the EmdoorVR Vision SE headset at the CES electronics expo in Las Vegas last month. Photo: Handout>\n2024 is going to be different, according to IDC.\nThe global AR and VR market is expected to grow more than 46 per cent thanks to the launch of Apple's Vision Pro, as well as the availability of the Facebook owner's Meta Quest 3, released last October.\nThe sector is \"at a critical point in its short history,\" said Ramon Llamas, IDC research director for mobile devices and AR/VR. \"Apple's entry [in 2024] will bring much needed attention to a small market, but it will also force other companies to compete in different ways.\"\nEstablished in 2015, EmdoorVR started as a contract manufacturer of VR devices for Chinese tech firms including iQiyi and ZTE, as well as other industry and government clients.\nEmdoorVR's enterprise-facing business contributes around 90 per cent of the firm's total revenue, according to Shi. The company has shipped 200,000 units of its AX161 headset, an enterprise product with the same specifications as Vision SE, since its launch last year.\nVision SE is EmdoorVR's shot at the consumer segment, and the company is counting on Apple to pave the way.\nThe device's marketing and launch schedule follows closely that of the Californian giant: Vision SE hit the market in October, just months after Apple unveiled the Vision Pro in June. EmdoorVR then showcased its headset at CES, one of the world's leading consumer electronics expos, which took place in Las Vegas last month, right before the Vision Pro shipped on February 2.\nA person tried out a Meta Quest 3 headset at the Facebook owner's headquarters in Menlo Park, California.

Photo: AFP>\nApple's entry into the VR and AR market has already drawn the interest of Chinese app developers. DingTalk, the work collaboration platform run by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, recently launched a native app for the Vision Pro, allowing users to send messages and hold video meetings in a three-dimensional virtual environment.\nAlibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.\nShanghai-based online travel service provider Trip.com Group - which also operates Ctrip, Qunar and Skyscanner - has also introduced an app for the Vision Pro, letting users watch panoramic videos of travel destinations, such as Mount Everest and the Sahara.\nEmdoor's Shi said he saw the Apple Vision Pro as a major opportunity to educate the market and bring substantial changes to the content ecosystem and supply chain, which would eventually make similar headsets more popular and affordable.\nBut for now, his top goal is just to stay afloat after a challenging year.\n\"2023 has been tough for the VR industry, which saw tech giants downsize their investment and manpower in these projects,\" Shi said. \"My priority for my team is to survive and ship products.\"\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

In 2023, the fund returned 21.3% net of fees underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 26.2%. The fund was up 448% net since inception in 2016 vs the S&P at 161%, an annual outperformance of 11.7%. Last year was the second calendar year in a row that the fund underperformed the S&P 500, and the first since 2019.

At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026.

        "Title": "People are wearing Apple Vision Pro headsets while driving Teslas. Fuzzy distracted-driving laws suggest they can get away with it",
        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "Apple Vision Pro owners seem willing to pay thousands of dollars to not look at the world in front of them.\nSince Apple Vision Pro\u2019s Friday release across U.S. stores \u2014 with an eye-watering starting price of $3,500 \u2014 people have been spotted wearing their headsets courtside at NBA games, at the gym, on the subway, and crossing the street. At least two viral videos show people in the driver\u2019s seat of a moving Tesla while still wearing the Apple Vision Pro headset, drawing criticism from government officials and other advocates for distraction-free driving.\n\u201cDriving while wearing a VR headset is reckless and disregards the safety of everyone on the road,\u201d \u00a0a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesperson told Fortune in a statement. \u201cAll vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems require a fully attentive human driver performing the driving task and monitoring the surrounding environment at all times.\u201d\nThe Apple Vision Pro user guide warns users to \u201cnever use Apple Vision Pro while operating a moving vehicle, bicycle, heavy machinery, or in any other situations requiring attention to safety.\u201d\nDistracted driving in the U.S. is a growing problem. The NHTSA reported 3,522 deaths in 2021 \u2014 compared to 3,142 the year before, a 12% increase \u2014 from distracted driving, or \u201cany activity that diverts attention from driving\u201d like texting, eating, or fiddling with your in-car entertainment. These accidents account for between 8-9% of car-related deaths in the U.S.\nCars with self-driving features have dangers of their own. Tesla recalled 2 million vehicles in December due to issues with the self-driving features, and U.S. safety regulators have investigated 1,000 Tesla Autopilot-related accidents, 40 of which were fatal.\nWhile there isn\u2019t comprehensive evidence on the prevalence of distracted driving in partially automated vehicles, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, there\u2019s a widespread perception that partially automated vehicles are the same as fully self-driving cars, which has led drivers to take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel.\nDante Lentini, who posted a video of himself wearing the Apple Vision Pro headset while in the driver\u2019s seat of a partially automated Tesla and appearing to be pulled over by police, told Fortune that the stunt wasn\u2019t as dangerous as it looked. He said his device was on transparency mode and that he was viewing the road from the headset\u2019s cameras. Lentini said an Apple engineer told him the Apple Vision Pro has a steering-wheel detector that does not allow users in the driver seat to use its apps. Apple did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nWearing the headset while driving isn\u2019t as dangerous as using other technologies behind the wheel, Lentini argued.\n\u201cWhile I understand the initial backlash and concern, I believe people may not know the device displays a passthrough vision display of what\u2019s in front of me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t recommend driving with it on, I would find someone being on their phone or even eating to be more hindered.\u201d\nDespite the video showing a police car pulled up behind him in a parking lot, Lentini was not pulled over or given a citation. The video was meant to be a skit, he said.\nLentini wasn\u2019t busted for distracted driving, and inconsistencies in laws banning distracting technology in cars may explain why.\nThe use of handheld devices while driving is illegal in 24 states, and texting is illegal in 48 states, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics \u2014 and in all but two of those states, texting while driving is a primary law. That means law enforcement can ticket a driver for distracted driving without any other traffic violation, such as speeding.\nBut texting only accounts for some of the distractions behind the wheel. Two-thirds of drivers surveyed by the IIHS reported performing a distracting activity behind the wheel, like using a navigation app, making a call, or reading texts. Eight percent of those surveyed reported playing a video game while driving.\nWhile 35 states have laws that prohibit screens in drivers\u2019 lines of sight, some of those states, such as New York and New Jersey, limit the ban to television, not internet streaming. In states like Texas, similar bans don\u2019t apply to devices with screens mounted near the dashboard.\nThe introduction of face-mounted technology further complicates how distracted-driving laws are enforced. In 2013, Southern California driver Cecelia Abadie was pulled over and given a speeding ticket while driving wearing Google Glass, an Android mixed-reality product. She was given an additional citation for wearing Google Glass. California vehicle code 27602 outlines that a person should not drive if a screen pointed toward the driver is displaying video. Both charges were thrown out because of lack of evidence that the device was turned on and playing video.\nBy February 2014, several states introduced legislation regulating the use of Google Glass behind the wheel. Google led lobbying efforts to kill bills banning Google Glass use while driving, arguing because the product was not yet readily available, banning it would be premature. Google Glass prototype sales ended in January 2015, but Google\u2019s most recent enterprise version of the device was on the market from 2019 to 2023.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Apple Vision Pro will face similar regulatory hurdles as the Google Glass but until it does, expect more inadvisable headset sightings in online stunts.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway sells off some Apple stock",
        "Author": "  Nicole Goodkind, CNN ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway sold off 10 million shares of Apple stock in the final three months of 2023, representing about 1% of its holdings in the company.\nThe tech titan has become a major holding for the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s company and is known as one of the so-called \u201cfour giants\u201d \u2013 alongside its insurance, railroad and energy operations \u2013 that Buffett says drives most of Berkshire\u2019s value.\nBut the Omaha-based conglomerate announced on Wednesday it had slightly trimmed its position in Apple in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe selloff is notable for Buffett, who is known to hold onto stocks for long periods of time. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don\u2019t even think about owning it for 10 minutes,\u201d he\u2019s said.\nBerkshire still owns more than 905 million shares of the company, worth about $174 billion. That represents 6% of all Apple shares and one-fifth of Berkshire\u2019s entire portfolio.\nMany investors, hoping to duplicate the success of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio, closely watch and often copy Buffett\u2019s market moves.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Berkshire, which began investing in Apple in 2016, has pared back some of its holdings in the tech company.\nIn the second half of 2020, the company sold off about $11 billion worth of the stock, a move that Buffett, 93, later said was \u201cprobably a mistake,\u201d in a shareholder meeting.\nBuffett went on to praise Apple CEO Tim Cook as \u201cone of the best managers in the world\u201d and last year said that the company \u201cjust happens to be a better business than any we own.\u201d\nBerkshire Hathaway purchased an additional $31 billion in Apple shares in 2022.\nShares of Apple fell by about 1.2% in morning trading on Thursday. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway were 0.7% higher.\nApple reported earlier this month that sales grew year-on-year during the December quarter, following a streak of four consecutive quarters of revenue declines caused by slower device sales amid an uncertain economic environment. But while product sales have ticked up, revenue from the key China region slid, a sign of growing competition weighing on the iPhone maker.\nThe company\u2019s stock is essentially flat from the start of this year.\nAs it works to right the ship, Apple has taken a bold bet and rolled out its first new product in nearly a decade: the Vision Pro mixed reality headset. The device, which cost Apple billions in research and development, is being touted by the company as the future of computing, but for now, it remains a costly and clunky piece of hardware with limited uses.\nFilings also showed that Berkshire sold 80 million shares of printer company HP in the fourth quarter of 2023, reducing its holdings by 78%. It also pared off 32% of its holdings in media company Paramount.\nBuffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders is due out on February 24. It will be the first letter since his long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, died last November.\nAdditional reporting by Clare Duffy\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Author": "  Chris Morris ",
        "Text": "Jon Stewart has confirmed that his Apple TV+ show, The Problem with Jon Stewart, was cancelled by Apple executives for fear of what the outspoken commentator might say during the 2024 elections.\nAppearing on CBS Mornings ahead of his return as the part-time host of The Daily Show, Stewart said he returned to the program that made him a household name as he felt he needed a platform to speak about the presidential race\u2014and his former bosses weren\u2019t comfortable with that.\n\u201cI wanted a place to unload thoughts as we get into this election season,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI thought I was going to do it over at \u2014 they call it Apple TV+. It\u2019s a television enclave, very small. It\u2019s like living in Malibu. But they decided \u2026 they felt that they didn\u2019t want me to say things that might get me in trouble.\u201d\nThe Problem With Jon Stewart came to an abrupt end last October as Stewart and Apple parted ways weeks before the show\u2019s third season was set to begin taping. That show was Stewart\u2019s first regular television appearance in six years after his 16-year Daily Show run at Comedy Central.\nStewart has never shied away from controversial topics. The Problem with Jon Stewart had already tackled issues including gender identity and gun control, with many episodes going viral. The most recent season was nominated for an Emmy in the outstanding talk series category. But it was Stewart\u2019s outspoken style on political matters that made him a star on The Daily Show. He continued to keep politicians accountable after leaving that program, often holding press conferences in Washington D.C. on matters including 9/11 First Responders and health benefits for veterans. In 2022, Stewart was the recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in humor.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "Apple's recent move to boost the interest rate for its Apple Card Savings Account to 4.5% is now prompting a competitor to do the same. Cash App today announced it will now offer \"up to\" a 4.5% APY (annual percentage yield) for its Cash App Savings customers, with a few caveats. While Apple's Savings account requires that customers qualify for an Apple Card credit card, Cash App will limit its high percentage rate to its cardholders in a different way.\nThe company says that customers will have to direct deposit $300 or more per month in paychecks to increase their rate to 4.5%. This could be more challenging for those who bank elsewhere but use Cash App for peer-to-peer payments or business purchases. But for those new to Cash App, it could prove an incentive to use the app as their main account going forward. (Without direct deposit, Cash App's rate is a less remarkable 1.5%).\nTo earn the 4.5% rate, customers must also have a Cash App Card, be using a personal (not business) account, and be at least 18 years old.\nImage Credits: Cash App\nTo be competitive with other banks, Cash App offers other perks. For example, customers have overdraft coverage of up to $50 on their Cash App Card purchases, free ATM withdrawals in-network and one free withdrawal per month at any ATM, plus access to call customer support from within the app, the company says.\nThe news is another example of not only how Apple's entry into the savings market is forcing others to raise rates to compete, but also how consumers are benefiting from the Federal Reserve's push to fight inflation. Banks take their cues from the federal funds rate, which has also been raised.\nAt launch, the Apple Savings Account arrived with a high APY of 4.15% but Apple upped it to 4.5% last month. At the time, Apple's rate was nearly 10x higher than the national average.\nOther fintechs have followed Apple's lead to attract customers. Another digital banking service, Step, raised its rate to 5% following Apple's entry into the market, for instance.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/cash-app-takes-on-apple-with-a-4-5-apy-for-savings-accounts-with-direct-deposit/\n"

The company is planning to bring them back in the future. Of course, Zuckerberg took the chance to talk about the Quest's bigger library and to emphasize that the Quest, unlike the Vision Pro, has access to the YouTube and Xbox apps.

        "Text": "The automotive industry is notoriously challenging, so much so that even a behemoth with a market capitalization in the trillions of dollars has reportedly opted to abandon its ambitions in the sector.\nApple is shutting down its electric vehicle (EV) project, according to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the decision. It would mark the conclusion of a decade-long endeavor.\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in.

Try these 5 easy money hacks to help you make and save thousands of dollars in the new year (they will only take seconds)\nThe news caught the eye of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who reacted on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a saluting emoji followed by a cigarette emoji.\nIn a subsequent post, Musk remarked: \u201cThe natural state of a car company is dead.\u201d\nThe abrupt end to Apple\u2019s EV project could spell good news for the existing players in the market. Here\u2019s a look at two EV companies that Wall Street finds particularly attractive \u2014 plus a Warren Buffett EV investment that\u2019s beating Tesla in one key metric.\nWhen people think of EV stocks, Tesla is usually the first one to come to mind.\nIn 2023, the company achieved a significant milestone by delivering 1,808,581 EVs, which represents a 38% increase from 2022.\nIn the U.S., Tesla\u2019s dominance in the EV market is particularly evident. Data from Kelly Blue Book indicates that 55% of the EVs purchased by Americans in 2023 were Tesla products, highlighting the brand's strong foothold and consumer preference in the domestic market.\nHowever, as one of the market's most dynamic mega-cap names, Tesla's shares have experienced considerable volatility. They doubled in value in 2023 but have seen a decline of 18% so far in 2024.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives sees a revival on the horizon. The analyst has placed a price target of $315 on Tesla, implying a potential upside north of 50%.\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\nGiven that Ford's best seller is the F-Series of pickup trucks, the company isn\u2019t considered a pure-play EV stock.\nBut the automaker has made significant strides in electrifying its lineup.\nIn November 2019, Ford unveiled the Mustang Mach-E, a five-door electric compact SUV. This model hit the market in December 2020 and clinched the 2021 North American SUV of the Year Award. Moreover, Ford launched the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup in April 2022, marking another significant step in its EV journey.\nIn its latest earnings report, Ford highlighted: \u201cSales volumes of the F-150 Lightning pickup and Mustang Mach-E SUV both were up year-over-year and respectively the top-selling electric pickup and No. 3 most popular EV of any type in the U.S. for 2023.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has estimated a price target of $16 on Ford \u2014 around 30% above where the stock sits today.\nChinese EV manufacturer BYD has been a part of investing legend Warren Buffett's portfolio for more than a decade.\nIn 2008, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 225 million shares of BYD for $232 million, a move that proved to be highly lucrative. By the end of 2020, as stated in Berkshire\u2019s shareholder letter, their stake was valued at approximately $5.9 billion.\nAlthough Buffett later began reducing his stake in BYD, an October 2023 stock exchange filing reported on by Reuters revealed that Berkshire still held a sizable 7.98% stake in the company.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD\u2019s EV sales reached 526,409 vehicles, overtaking Tesla's deliveries of 484,507 EVs, according to Reuters, and displacing it as the top EV manufacturer globally. The Chinese company's success has been attributed to various factors, including its broad lineup with inexpensive models, price cuts, its battery-manufacturing capability, and the Chinese government's support of the country's EV sector.\nBYD's shares are not listed in the U.S., but they are traded over-the-counter, so American investors who want to buy the stock would need to choose a broker that supports trading them.\nHere's how you can invest in rental properties without the responsibility of being a landlord\n'The biggest crash in history': Robert Kiyosaki warns that millions of 401(k)s and IRAs will be 'toast' \u2014 here's what he likes for protection\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling inflation\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "Title": "Apple and Google received panicked letters from a Scottish council after their GPS kept sending vehicles down a flight of steps",
        "Author": "  Ryan Hogg ",
        "Text": "We\u2019ve all had that moment where we realize we need to be wary of GPS. You track down a highly recommended restaurant on Google Maps only to find it moved locations a couple of weeks ago. Or you take an Apple Maps\u2013approved shortcut straight into a dead end. On rare occasions, you might even find yourself unwittingly barreling down a flight of Edinburgh steps.\nThat last one might sound like hyperbole, but it\u2019s an issue a surprising number of drivers in the capital of Scotland found themselves in over the past couple of months.\nThe issue became widespread enough that the City of Edinburgh Council was forced to get in touch with Apple and Google to ask the tech giants to update their GPS, short for \u201cglobal positioning system,\u201d after out-of-date maps left multiple drivers stranded in a stairway beside a pub.\nThe council installed steps on the city\u2019s Greenside Lane and blocked the road off from traffic as part of street design guidance that sought to make the street similar to others in the city, including those linking to the famous Royal Mile.\nHowever, those updates weren\u2019t reflected in Apple Maps or Google Maps, which continued to direct drivers down the path.\nReports began to emerge last month that the issue was leading to cars getting stuck on the steps beside the Theatre Royal Bar, with the Metro reporting that a Toyota Prius and SUV were known victims of the mix-up.\nAmused residents have taken to social media to publicize a trend that was at risk of becoming endemic, and also appears to have affected heavy-duty transit vans and delivery vehicles.\nOne of those unfortunate people, an unnamed delivery driver, told BBC Scotland: \u201cI was just following the satnav [satellite-based navigation]. I always remember I used to come down this way. I followed it and just got stuck.\n\u201cI had no idea there was a step there; I used to come down this way. I am a bit embarrassed about it.\u201d\nIn a paper published last week, the council said it had been made aware the change had led vehicles to careen into the steps.\nA representative for the City of Edinburgh told Fortune that Google had updated its GPS to reflect that Greenside Lane was no longer suitable for cars, while Apple had been asked to make a correction.\nFortune has approached Apple for comment.\nAn experiment carried out by Fortune using both Google Maps and Apple Maps shows drivers are no longer directed down Greenside Lane. A representative for Google confirmed to Fortune that it had updated its map as soon as it was made aware of the change.\nWhile it waited to confirm the maps had been updated, the council installed a temporary barrier to prevent further accidents from happening.\nCouncillor Scott Arthur, the city\u2019s transport and environment committee convener, said: \u201cThe footpath in this area is incredibly busy, so these incidents are really concerning.\n\u201cWhile we would expect drivers to use common sense in a situation like this, we are going to install temporary barriers this week to prevent it happening again.\n\u201cSatnav is an incredibly useful tool, but it\u2019s no substitute for common sense. Cars and trucks don\u2019t go down steps.\u201d\nGPS, or as Brits call it, \u201csatnav,\u201d has improved by leaps and bounds since it was first popularized among consumers as an in-car attachment.\nAccording to Google, the maps are updated constantly or, to quote its maps group: \u201cliterally, every second of every day!\u201d The group appears to use a \u201cSwiss cheese model\u201d of risk management, where layered defenses minimize the possibility of a notable error occurring.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly collecting new information about the world, whether from satellite imagery and Street View cars, or Google Maps users and local business owners, and using that information to update the map.\u201d\nBut smaller updates, including the placement of a few steps, are much harder for satellites to pick up on a map, and updates may slip through the net.\nOn this occasion, it seems Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s various avenues for updating maps fell short in Edinburgh.\nThe accidents in Scotland\u2019s capital, which didn\u2019t lead to any reported injuries, offer a sobering reminder of the limits of modern-day technology, particularly as drivers begin to embrace autonomous driving.\nAnd the incident serves as a reminder: Next time you\u2019re directed down a side street, make sure to double-check what\u2019s really there.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

This week\u2019s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA.\nWe have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market.\nThese companies, along with their peers in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of stocks \u2013 Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia \u2013 led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year.\nOther than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn\u2019t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively.\nTesla\u2019s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market.\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.\nThis week\u2019s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week\u2019s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, February 2nd, we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members, or 46% of the index\u2019s total membership.\nWe have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA and Celsius Holdings CELH.\nEarnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple, NVIDIA and Celsius Holdings.\nLet's take a closer look at each.\nApple\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\nStill, EPS wasn't the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\nIt's worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises.\nShares couldn't hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin.\nNVIDIA \nNVIDIA's quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA's Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity.\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nCelsius Holdings\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year.\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong growth.\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including those above, have posted quarterly records.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Will Nvidia Beat Amazon and Google in Joining Apple and Microsoft in the $2 Trillion Club?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) delivered a sizzling return of nearly 240% last year. Believe it or not, the stock is on pace to generate gains that aren't too far behind that mark in 2024.\nThanks to its share price soaring close to 50% so far this year, Nvidia now sports a market cap of nearly $1.83 trillion. Will the chipmaker beat Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) in joining Apple and Microsoft in the $2 trillion club?\nMicrosoft currently stands at the top of the mountain with a market cap of over $3 trillion. Apple isn't too far behind, with its market cap of more than $2.8 trillion. For now, these are the only stocks with market caps above $2 trillion.\nNvidia only needs to rise another 10% or so to join Apple and Microsoft in the $2 trillion club. However, Alphabet and Amazon are nipping at Nvidia's heels with market caps of $1.82 trillion and $1.77 trillion, respectively.\nIt's a neck-and-neck race at this point. The momentum is certainly on Nvidia's side, though. Its stock performance trounced both Alphabet and Amazon in 2023 and has continued to do so thus far this year.\nThe primary potential catalyst that could push Nvidia's market cap above the $2 trillion threshold is the strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Surging interest in generative AI is providing an ongoing tailwind for GPU demand.\nBut Alphabet and Amazon also benefit from the generative AI boom. The two companies provide cloud services with a variety of tools to help customers build generative AI apps.\nWall Street appears to be most confident about Amazon's prospects of joining the $2 trillion club soon. The average 12-month price target for Amazon reflects an upside potential of 21%. Of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February, 43 rated the stock as a buy or strong buy.\nAnalysts are also upbeat about Alphabet. The consensus price target for the stock is 12% above the current share price. Thirty-eight of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG this month rate Alphabet as a buy or strong buy.\nWhat about Nvidia? There's still some enthusiasm about the chip stock on Wall Street. However, the overall mood isn't nearly as positive compared to the sentiment for Amazon and Alphabet.\nThe average 12-month price target for Nvidia is 7% below the current share price. While 21 of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February rate Nvidia as a buy or strong buy, another 15 recommend holding the stock. One analyst rates the stock as an underperform. One analyst recommends that investors sell their Nvidia shares.\nThis is a big swing from January, when all but five analysts rated Nvidia as a buy or a strong buy. It's probably fair to say that many on Wall Street now think that Nvidia's share price has gotten ahead of itself, even with the company's tremendous growth prospects.\nI'm confident that the market caps of Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia will top $2 trillion over time. Which stock will join the $2 trillion club first? My hunch is that it will indeed be Nvidia.\nYes, the limited availability of GPUs due to strong demand is motivating customers to look to other AI chipmakers, such as AMD\u00a0and to develop their own chips. Nvidia's meteoric trajectory since early last year won't be sustainable indefinitely. However, it doesn't have to be for the stock to beat Amazon and Alphabet over the near term.\nAll three stocks need close to the same percentage gain to hit $2 trillion. Nvidia has the strongest tailwind of the three right now. Perhaps just as important, though, is that the company is likely to report its next quarterly results a day or two before Amazon and Alphabet do. Positive news could push Nvidia over the threshold.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "With thousands of preorders for the Vision Pro rolling in, many consumers are curious about Apple\u2019s AR/VR headset and the apps that will arrive alongside the new device. While some are from companies you recognize -- Disney+, Max, TikTok, Zoom, Reddit and others -- there are plenty of independent developers launching visionOS-optimized apps on Friday. So far, more than 600 apps and games have been designed for the Apple Vision Pro, Apple said earlier this week.\nFrom spatial puzzle games to an app where you can view interior design projects in 3D, here are some of the visionOS apps from smaller developers that users can try out when their headset arrives. We\u2019ll keep adding more to this list as they roll out.\nImage Credits: Soul Assembly\nSoul Spire is a spatial puzzle game exclusively developed for the Vision Pro. Players must free the friendly little ghosts trapped within color-shifting cubes.\nImage Credits: Ryan McLeod\nBlackbox is a unique spatial puzzle game where, instead of tapping or swiping, players must interact with puzzles -- which appear as floating bubbles in the physical world -- in other creative ways like singing and rotating, among other methods that don\u2019t involve using their hands.\nImage Credits: Tempuno/Michael Temper\nPloppy Pairs is a card-matching game that can be played with friends and family via SharePlay during FaceTime calls. You can also move, scale and rotate the cards so they appear on the coffee table in front of you or make them as big as your floor. Additionally, Michael Temper -- the developer behind Ploppy -- is launching a hidden-object game called \"Where is Ploppy?\".\nImage Credits: Sindre Sorhus\nDoodle Draw is a simple digital drawing pad where you can brainstorm ideas and use your creativity to sketch doodles with various brushes, pens, markers and colors.\nImage Credits: ModumHQ\nNowPlaying is for all your music knowledge and discovery needs. Search your favorite song to learn detailed information about the artists, see recommendations, experience 3D models of Grammys and other music awards, and even earn trophies that can be displayed on a virtual shelf. Thanks to its ShazamKit integration, it also can identify which song is playing in your environment, whether it\u2019s from a vinyl record or a TV show playing in the background.\nImage Credits: Algoriddim\nDJ app and AI mixer Djay is aimed at recreating the live DJ experience, featuring an interactive, hyperrealistic 3D turntable with controllable knobs and buttons, different futuristic-looking environments/backgrounds and a built-in music library.\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1yFq10fhzw?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent&w=640&h=360]\nMusic video editor Spool allows you to create music videos and add visual effects as you perform by tapping visual pads.\nImage Credits: AmazeVR\nAmazeVR Concerts lets you watch live-action 3D footage of your favorite artist in rendered virtual environments.

There are controls for waveform, reverb, distortion, chorus, scale snapping and more. In addition, Spatial Symphony includes a three-dimensional waveform visualization, making it so the sound waves move toward you in 3D.\nImage Credits: MindNode\nMindNode is a visual brainstorming app that helps you outline and organize notes in the form of thought bubbles that float around your virtual space.\nImage Credits: Cynapse\nNumerics is a dashboard app that lets you bring your KPIs from over 90 tools like HubSpot and Google Sheets to view all your tasks in one place.\nImage Credits: The Omni Group\nProject management tool OmniPlan is introducing a dedicated app for the Vision Pro that allows you to visualize Gantt charts in a large window the size of your room. The Omni Group is also bringing its other apps to the headset, including OmniFocus, OmniGraffle and OmniOutliner.\nImage Credits: JigSpace\nJigSpace wants to enable anyone to show their ideas with the use of 3D content, audio, video and text in spatial presentations. The company uses its collaboration with the Alfa Romeo F1 Team as an example (image shown above), bringing its life-size C43 car built to scale.\nFocus is a task management app that applies the Pomodoro method. You can start and stop timers and track your progress on different tasks. You can also put a small focus timer window on the side while you browse other apps. The app is free for the first year on Vision Pro. After that, users can pay an annual fee of $39.99 to use it across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac.\nImage Credits: Meaningful things\nIf you don't want any of the task management stuff, but just want to create timers, Focused Work is the app for you.\nImage Credits: Focused Work\nImage Credits: Axel Le Pennec\nTizipizi is a time zone converter and world clock, letting you convert time to schedule a team meeting with staff worldwide. The app also allows you to compare availability with colleagues and personalize clocks by assigning it to a certain event or renaming it after someone who lives in that time zone.\nImage Credits: Good Snooze/Jordi Bruin\nNavi translates conversations in real time, allowing you to see live captions during FaceTime calls.\nWell, the name says it all. It's world clock widgets for the Vision Pro device.\nImage Credits: World Clock Widgets (opens in a new window)\nStudy Snacks splits the words you are learning across the space and then you have to put them together to guess the right word.\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ednLmtKSA0I?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent&w=640&h=360]\nThe Subjects app, which helps students with tracking classes, homework and grades, is launching its version for Vision Pro.\nImage Credits: Subjects\nImage Credits: Fifth Star Labs\nSky Guide reimagined its constellation finder app for the Apple Vision Pro, giving you an immersive experience built for spatial computing so you can imagine you\u2019re star gazing inside your home. The app also uses gaze detection to aim a laser pointer at planets and stars as well as hand gestures to zoom in or pull constellations from the sky.\nImage Credits: Planner 5D\nPlanner 5D, a 2D/3D home improvement tool, is bringing its interior design features to the Vision Pro. Users can view 3D design projects, customize items using their eyes and hands, explore a large catalog of furniture and home d\u00e9cor, as well as experience renders and 360 panoramas in VR mode.\nImage Credits: Elite Hoops\nElite Hoops, the basketball play creation app, launched its visionOS app so basketball coaches can draw up plays and defenses and see their drills come to life in their living rooms.\nSince YouTube decided not to build an app for the Vision Pro, indie developer Christian Selig, best known for the third-party Reddit client Apollo, made one instead. The $5 Juno app uses YouTube's embed API to load videos in a web view and offers controls for playback. (Read more about Juno here).\nImage Credits: Christian Selig\nS\u00f6ka is a goal tracker app where you can make different bucket lists and track them. It lets you do things like marking countries that you have visited on a virtual map, browsing photos to add to your goal with Unsplash integration and discovering new activities.\nImage Credits: S\u00f6ka\nPinch gestures are the prime points for interactions with the VisionOS interface. The Spatial Symphony app makes clever use of it by making a music creation app. The developer said that the idea came from Theremin \u2014 a real-life instrument that generates sound as you move your hands in the air.\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErxrYhdHy00?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent&w=640&h=360]\nVision Pro is launching with Apple's mindfulness.
