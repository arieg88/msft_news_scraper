        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) took the leap into generative AI, debuting its Apple Intelligence platform at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. It\u2019s a massive shift for the company, bringing a host of new features to its various operating systems and products.\nApple certainly isn\u2019t the first company to debut generative AI capabilities for its software or devices. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) both debuted their own AI chatbots and services in 2023 and updated them with new capabilities during their respective developer conferences earlier this year. But Apple is unique in how it\u2019s positioning its AI service. Samsung also has its own Galaxy AI services, which use the company's own AI models as well as Google Gemini models.\nRather than introducing a digital know-it-all, however, Apple, is presenting Apple Intelligence as a personalized AI platform designed to understand your data and provide it to you when you need it most. It\u2019s a subtle distinction but one that acts as a key differentiator for Apple as it seeks to prove that its approach is the one consumers will find most useful.\n\u201cWhen we think about what it means for intelligence to be really useful, it has to be centered on you,\u201d said Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi. \u201cWe think AI's role is not to replace our users but to empower them. \u2026 It needs to be integrated into the experience you're using all the time. It needs to be intuitive, but it also needs to be informed by your personal context, really, knowledge of you.\u201d\nApple is creating a personal kind of AI experience in a number of ways, including a new and improved version of Siri that is contextually aware of your data. For instance, imagine you have to pick your mother up from the airport but don't know what time she gets in.\nYou'll be able to ask Siri when your mom\u2019s flight is landing, and the assistant will find the appropriate messages your mother sent you about her flight via email or text, then check real-time flight data to give you the exact time her flight lands.\nSiri will also be able to understand the content on your screen. Say your friend sends you an address followed by a series of unrelated texts. You can tell Siri, \u201cSave this address to their Contact Card,\u201d and Siri will recognize that you want to save that particular address to your friend\u2019s Contact Card without having to say your friend\u2019s name over again.\nSiri isn\u2019t the only place you\u2019ll find Apple Intelligence. Apple says it\u2019s using the technology to help prioritize notifications, putting priority messages and app alerts at the top of your notifications stack and even summarizing long threads to help you catch up without having to scroll through endless messages.\nLike Google and Samsung, Apple has also added generative AI-powered photo editing features and the ability to summarize and rewrite text in Mail and other apps.\nBut generative AI raises privacy concerns since data is regularly shared back and forth with the web. And it could be especially problematic for Apple to intertwine so much of your personal data with generative AI apps. To that end, Apple says it is using a number of on-device AI models that don\u2019t share your data with cloud-based services.\nFor requests that are too complex for on-device models, Apple says it will connect to its own specialized cloud services it calls Private Cloud Compute that run on Apple\u2019s own servers powered by its own chips, which the company says ensures requests remain secure. What\u2019s more, the company says that when users make requests, only a small amount of necessary data goes up to the cloud.\nApple further points out that its servers have no storage options for user data, so it won\u2019t save any of the information it uses in your requests. The software powering Private Cloud Compute is also publicized so that it can be audited by security researchers.\nBasically, the company wants users to know that while some AI prompts will use cloud-based AI models, your user data won\u2019t end up being used to train future Apple models or live on Apple\u2019s servers in perpetuity.\nApple isn\u2019t only using its own AI models. It has also partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the company\u2019s devices. But Apple says you\u2019ll be asked whether you want to use the service every time you try to access it before anything is sent to the OpenAI\u2019s servers. The company says it\u2019s also working to integrate other AI models including Google\u2019s Gemini.\nApple Intelligence will be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Macs and iPads running its M1 chip and newer later this fall. And if the company is successful in its effort to make generative AI truly useful for the average user, it could set Apple up as one of the industry leaders in the still-nascent space.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) were on a tear Tuesday morning, with the stock adding as much as 6.7%. As of 1:53 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 6.2%.\nThe catalyst that sent the iPhone maker higher was the company's big artificial intelligence (AI) reveal to kick off Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).\nInvestors have been waiting since early last year for insight into Apple's plans to join the AI revolution. At the WWDC keynote yesterday, CEO Tim Cook finally detailed the company's plans, and Wall Street's response was extremely bullish.\nThe biggest revelation was the debut of Apple Intelligence, which will provide on-device generative AI processing across the company's entire product line while also maintaining Apple's famous emphasis on security.\nSiri will get a long-awaited AI upgrade and have a greater ability to interact with other iPhone apps. ChatGPT will also be integrated into the iPhone, giving users the option to engage the chatbot for specific topics. Apple also unveiled a host of other AI-powered features that will debut with iOS 18, which will be released this fall.\nMany investors had taken a \"wait and see\" approach with Apple, worried about waning sales of its flagship iPhone. However, in the wake of the company's presentation, Wall Street has turned decidedly bullish.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives expressed the prevailing sentiment, suggesting the addition of these new tools to the iPhone will spark \"an AI-driven iPhone upgrade cycle starting with iPhone 16.\" The analyst also suggested AI will add $30 to $40 per share to Apple's growth story.\nEven as big tech has staged a significant rally over the past year, Apple's stock has been the outlier, up just 7%, compared to 25% gains for the S&P 500. A laundry list of AI-powered features will likely mark the dawn of the next upgrade cycle, boosting the company's results and putting Apple back in investors' good graces.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple's stock (AAPL) surged 7% on Tuesday to reach a record-high close for the first time in 2024 as investors digested the announcement of its AI platform, Apple Intelligence. \nShares in the iPhone maker fell slightly in premarket trading on Wednesday, down less than 1%.\nAfter the stock fell on Monday during and after the company's WWDC conference, the stock moved higher, notching its best single-day performance since November 2022 as some Wall Street analysts cheered the company's announcements.\n\"If you look at the signal away from the noise, you realize that this is unprecedented capability that Apple is going to introduce, and it's going to integrate AI into everyday life,\" D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance (video above).\nFollowing Monday's event, Luria upgraded Apple to Buy from Neutral and raised his price target to $230 from $200.\nOn Monday, Apple announced \"Apple Intelligence,\" its long-awaited foray into the generative AI space. The company said the platform would be integrated across the company's hardware and software products, ranging from the iPhone and Mac to mail, messages, and photos. Apple Intelligence will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPads and Macs running Apple's M1 series chips and newer later this fall.\nKey features of the launch include updates to Siri, which will now be able to parse messages for addresses or find photos in a phone's photo library based on voice prompts. Apple also launched new software updates for its iPhones, watches, and computer products.\n\"Our experience with consumer surveys with prior generations of iPhone launches tell us that the hardware upgrade cycle is more driven by a collection of feature upgrades across diverse applications, which in aggregate will provide ... reasons to upgrade over the next few years,\" JPMorgan senior analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\nHe added, \"The release of the AI features across Mac, iPads and iPhones will support an upgrade cycle across all the devices.\"\nThe announcements capped off a month of excitement for the stock as rumors around some of the news, including a partnership with ChatGPT operator OpenAI, had already been percolating.\nAfter briefly being passed by Nvidia (NVDA), the stock of the iPhone maker is now back as the second-most-valuable company (behind Microsoft) in the world with a market capitalization of more than $3.1 trillion.\nFollowing a slow start to the year amid concerns of slowing iPhone demand, Apple stock is now up more than 15% in the past two months. Analysts like Luria and Chatterjee believe the next iPhone upgrade cycle could be on the horizon as the new AI features are only coming to iPhone 15 pro and later generations.\n\"As people buy new phones this holiday season, they're going to see this great functionality,\" Luria said. \"They're going to show their friends and family and the product upgrade cycle will happen over the next few months and quarters.\"\nThis, Luria argued, should be a key catalyst for the stock moving forward.\n\"The stock has been flat because there hasn't been revenue growth at Apple,\" Luria said. \"Now, we think that this will allow Apple's overall growth to accelerate from the low single digits into the mid-, maybe even high-single digits over the next year or two. That's what can drive Apple's stock.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Foo Yun Chee ",
        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) -European Union antitrust regulators charged on Monday that Apple breached the bloc's tech rules, a charge that could result in a hefty fine for the iPhone maker which also faces another investigation into new fees imposed on app developers.\nThe European Commission, which is also the EU's antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple following an investigation launched in March.\nThe charge against Apple is the first by the Commission under its landmark Digital Markets Act which seeks to rein in the power of Big Tech and ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals. It has until March next year to issue a final decision.\nDMA violations could result in a fine of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover.\nEU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager cited issues with Apple's new terms, saying that they fell short of complying with the DMA. Apple can avoid a fine if it can address the concerns by modifying its business terms.\n\"As they stand, we think that these new terms do not allow app developers to communicate freely with their end users, and to conclude contracts with them,\" she told a conference.\nShe said it was up to Apple to decide how to comply with the DMA and not for her to tell the company what to do.\nApple said it had made a number of changes in the past several months to comply with the DMA after getting feedback from app developers and the Commission.\n\"As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission,\" it said in an email.\nThe Commission said under most of the business terms, Apple allows steering only through 'link-outs', meaning that app developers can include a link in their app that redirects the customer to a web page where the customer can conclude a contract.\nIt also criticised the fees charged by Apple for facilitating via the App Store the initial acquisition of a new customer by developers, saying they went beyond what was strictly necessary for such remuneration.\n\"We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,\" Apple said in its email.\nNEW CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe EU executive said it was also opening an investigation into the iPhone maker over its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores and whether these were necessary and proportionate.\nAt issue is its core technology fee, the multi-step user journey to download and install alternative app stores on iPhones and the eligibility requirements for developers to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones.\nApple rolled out the new fees in March in the EU, which include the core technology fee to major app developers even if they do not use any of its payment services, prompting criticism from \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games and others.\nVestager also criticised Apple's announcement last week that it would delay the launch of its AI-powered features of its AI-powered features in the EU which the company blamed on the DMA. Vestager said that it seemed that Apple suggested that its AI integration may be anti-competitive.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n"

The dialogue about a partnership didn\u2019t reach any formal stage, and Apple has no active plans to integrate Llama.\nThe preliminary talks occurred around the time Apple started hashing out deals to use OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gemini in its products. The iPhone maker announced the ChatGPT agreement earlier this month and said it was expecting to offer Gemini in the future.\nApple decided not to move forward with formal Meta discussions in part because it doesn\u2019t see that company\u2019s privacy practices as stringent enough, according to the people. Apple has spent years criticizing Meta\u2019s technology, and integrating Llama into the iPhone would have been a stark about-face.\nApple also sees ChatGPT as a superior offering. Google, meanwhile, is already a partner for search in Apple\u2019s Safari web browser, so a future Gemini deal would build on that relationship.\nSpokespeople for Apple and Meta declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the two companies were in talks about an AI partnership.\nApple unveiled a suite of artificial intelligence features at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. The new technology \u2014 called Apple Intelligence \u2014 includes homegrown tools for summarizing notifications, transcribing voice memos and generating custom emoji.\nBut Apple\u2019s chatbot technology isn\u2019t as advanced as that of rivals, prompting it to seek out partners. The company also believes that customers will want the ability to switch between different chatbots depending on their needs, similar to how they might hop between Google and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Bing for searches.\nApple continues to talk to AI startup Anthropic about eventually adding that company\u2019s chatbot as an option, the people said. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year as part of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nThe current deal with OpenAI doesn\u2019t involve money swapping hands, but Apple will allow paying ChatGPT customers to access their subscriptions within the iOS operating system. That could generate revenue for OpenAI, a percentage of which could be headed to Apple in the form of App Store commissions.\nMeta and Apple were on friendlier terms a decade ago, when the iPhone maker was integrating Facebook into iOS. But the companies have become fierce rivals in recent years, competing over AI, home devices and mixed-reality headsets.\n\u2014With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\nCorporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash\nWhy BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford\nHow to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Setting a new standard for privacy in AI, Apple Intelligence understands personal context to deliver intelligence that is helpful and relevant\nCUPERTINO, Calif., June 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today introduced Apple Intelligence\u2122, the personal intelligence system for iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae, and Mac\u00ae that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that\u2019s incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS\u00ae 18, and macOS\u00ae Sequoia. It harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. With Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers.\n\"We\u2019re thrilled to introduce a new chapter in Apple innovation. Apple Intelligence will transform what users can do with our products \u2014 and what our products can do for our users,\" said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \"Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user\u2019s personal context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. And it can access that information in a completely private and secure way to help users do the things that matter most to them. This is AI as only Apple can deliver it, and we can\u2019t wait for users to experience what it can do.\"\nNew Capabilities for Understanding and Creating Language\nApple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages\u00ae, and third-party apps.\nWhether tidying up class notes, ensuring a blog post reads just right, or making sure an email is perfectly crafted, Writing Tools help users feel more confident in their writing. With Rewrite, Apple Intelligence allows users to choose from different versions of what they have written, adjusting the tone to suit the audience and task at hand. From finessing a cover letter, to adding humor and creativity to a party invitation, Rewrite helps deliver the right words to meet the occasion. Proofread checks grammar, word choice, and sentence structure while also suggesting edits \u2014 along with explanations of the edits \u2014 that users can review or quickly accept. With Summarize, users can select text and have it recapped in the form of a digestible paragraph, bulleted key points, a table, or a list.\nIn Mail, staying on top of emails has never been easier. With Priority Messages, a new section at the top of the inbox shows the most urgent emails, like a same-day dinner invitation or boarding pass. Across a user\u2019s inbox, instead of previewing the first few lines of each email, they can see summaries without needing to open a message. For long threads, users can view pertinent details with just a tap. Smart Reply provides suggestions for a quick response, and will identify questions in an email to ensure everything is answered.\nDeep understanding of language also extends to Notifications. Priority Notifications appear at the top of the stack to surface what\u2019s most important, and summaries help users scan long or stacked notifications to show key details right on the Lock Screen, such as when a group chat is particularly active. And to help users stay present in what they\u2019re doing, Reduce Interruptions is a new Focus that surfaces only the notifications that might need immediate attention, like a text about an early pickup from daycare.\nIn the Notes and Phone apps, users can now record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to help recall key points.\nImage Playground Makes Communication and Self-Expression Even More Fun\nApple Intelligence powers exciting image creation capabilities to help users communicate and express themselves in new ways. With Image Playground, users can create fun images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Image Playground is easy to use and built right into apps including Messages. It\u2019s also available in a dedicated app, perfect for experimenting with different concepts and styles. All images are created on device, giving users the freedom to experiment with as many images as they want.\nWith Image Playground, users can choose from a range of concepts from categories like themes, costumes, accessories, and places; type a description to define an image; choose someone from their personal photo library to include in their image; and pick their favorite style.\nWith the Image Playground experience in Messages, users can quickly create fun images for their friends, and even see personalized suggested concepts related to their conversations. For example, if a user is messaging a group about going hiking, they\u2019ll see suggested concepts related to their friends, their destination, and their activity, making image creation even faster and more relevant.\nIn Notes, users can access Image Playground through the new Image Wand in the Apple Pencil\u00ae tool palette, making notes more visually engaging. Rough sketches can be turned into delightful images, and users can even select empty space to create an image using context from the surrounding area. Image Playground is also available in apps like Keynote\u00ae, Freeform\u00ae, and Pages, as well as in third-party apps that adopt the new Image Playground API.\nGenmoji Creation to Fit Any Moment\nTaking emoji to an entirely new level, users can create an original Genmoji to express themselves. By simply typing a description, their Genmoji appears, along with additional options. Users can even create Genmoji of friends and family based on their photos. Just like emoji, Genmoji can be added inline to messages, or shared as a sticker or reaction in a Tapback\u00ae.\nNew Features in Photos Give Users More Control\nSearching for photos and videos becomes even more convenient with Apple Intelligence. Natural language can be used to search for specific photos, such as \"Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt,\" or \"Katie with stickers on her face.\" Search in videos also becomes more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips so users can go right to the relevant segment. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo \u2014 without accidentally altering the subject.\nWith Memories, users can create the story they want to see by simply typing a description. Using language and image understanding, Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. Users will even get song suggestions to match their memory from Apple Music\u00ae. As with all Apple Intelligence features, user photos and videos are kept private on device and are not shared with Apple or anyone else.\nSiri Enters a New Era\nPowered by Apple Intelligence, Siri\u00ae becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri is more natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal, with the ability to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. It can follow along if users stumble over words and maintain context from one request to the next. Additionally, users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment. Siri also has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when Siri is active.\nSiri can now give users device support everywhere they go, and answer thousands of questions about how to do something on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Users can learn everything from how to schedule an email in the Mail app, to how to switch from Light to Dark Mode.\nWith onscreen awareness, Siri will be able to understand and take action with users\u2019 content in more apps over time. For example, if a friend texts a user their new address in Messages, the receiver can say, \"Add this address to his contact card.\"\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri will be able to take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. For example, a user could say, \"Bring up that article about cicadas from my Reading List,\" or \"Send the photos from the barbecue on Saturday to Malia,\" and Siri will take care of it.\nSiri will be able to deliver intelligence that\u2019s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, \"Play that podcast that Jamie recommended,\" and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, \"When is Mom\u2019s flight landing?\" and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.\nA New Standard for Privacy in AI\nTo be truly helpful, Apple Intelligence relies on understanding deep personal context while also protecting user privacy. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence.\nWith Private Cloud Compute, Apple Intelligence can flex and scale its computational capacity and draw on larger, server-based models for more complex requests. These models run on servers powered by Apple silicon, providing a foundation that allows Apple to ensure that data is never retained or exposed.\nIndependent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to verify privacy, and Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac do not talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection. Apple Intelligence with Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in AI, unlocking intelligence users can trust.\nChatGPT Gets Integrated Across Apple Platforms\nApple is integrating ChatGPT access into experiences within iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, allowing users to access its expertise \u2014 as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities \u2014 without needing to jump between tools.\nSiri can tap into ChatGPT\u2019s expertise when helpful. Users are asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer directly.\nAdditionally, ChatGPT will be available in Apple\u2019s systemwide Writing Tools, which help users generate content for anything they are writing about. With Compose, users can also access ChatGPT image tools to generate images in a wide variety of styles to complement what they are writing.\nPrivacy protections are built in for users who access ChatGPT \u2014 their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. ChatGPT\u2019s data-use policies apply for users who choose to connect their account.\nChatGPT will come to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia later this year, powered by GPT-4o. Users can access it for free without creating an account, and ChatGPT subscribers can connect their accounts and access paid features right from these experiences.\nAvailability\nApple Intelligence is free for users, and will be available in beta as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia this fall in U.S. English. Some features, software platforms, and additional languages will come over the course of the next year. Apple Intelligence will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later, with Siri and device language set to U.S. English.

        "Title": "Here\u2019s Everything Apple Plans to Show at Its AI-Focused WWDC Event",
        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. isn\u2019t typically the first to embrace new product categories \u2014 as it famously showed with its iPhone, smartwatch and Vision Pro. All those areas were established before the company showed up, but Apple found a way to make its mark.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nApple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash\nHunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad\u2019s Reaction Was Remarkable.\nChinese Trader\u2019s $20 Million Pile of Russian Copper Goes Missing\nGavin Newsom Wants to Curb a Labor Law That Cost Businesses $10 Billion\nUS Inflation Broadly Cools in Encouraging Sign for Fed Officials\nNow it looks to do something similar with artificial intelligence. Nearly two years after the generative AI frenzy started, the company is preparing to lay out its vision for the technology. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference Monday, Apple will announce plans to deeply integrate AI into its major apps and features \u2014 all while reiterating a commitment to privacy and security.\nThe company\u2019s new AI system will be called Apple Intelligence, and it will come to new versions of the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, according to people familiar with the plans. There also will be a partnership with OpenAI that powers a ChatGPT-like chatbot. And the tech giant is preparing to show new software for the Vision Pro headset, Apple Watch and TV platforms.\nThe AI features will account for about half of Apple\u2019s WWDC keynote presentation, which starts at 10 a.m. Pacific time and typically runs for roughly two hours. Some of the buzziest features may be ones that don\u2019t focus on AI, such as ones that make the iPhone more customizable and improve the Apple Watch. A company spokesperson declined to comment on the plans.\nHere is everything to expect during the keynote address:\nAI Features\nApple\u2019s approach to AI will involve integrating the technology into as many of its apps as possible, in ways that ideally ease the daily lives of customers. The company is less focused on whiz-bang technology \u2014 like image and video generation \u2014 and instead concentrating on features with broad appeal.\nThe new capabilities will be opt-in, meaning Apple won\u2019t make users adopt them if they don\u2019t want to. The company will also position them as a beta version. The processing requirements of AI will mean that users need an iPhone 15 Pro or one of the models coming out this year. If they\u2019re using iPads or Macs, they\u2019ll need models with an M1 chip at least.\nApple\u2019s AI features will be powered by its own technology and tools from OpenAI. The services will either rely on on-device processing or cloud-based computing, depending on the sophistication of the task at hand. The new operating systems will include an algorithm to determine which approach should be taken for any particular task.\nAfter years of discouraging the use of cloud servers for processing data \u2014 and even chastising rivals that did so \u2014 Apple risks sparking controversy by using the cloud for AI. So a large part of its announcement will focus on the precautions that the company is taking, including security features on the chips that it\u2019s using in its data centers. Apple also won\u2019t build user profiles based on customer data, and the company will generate reports to show that consumers\u2019 information is secure and not being sold or read. At the same time, Apple will still tout the merits of on-device processing \u2014 when available.\nA major component of the AI push is summarization. Apple is planning features that can quickly recap articles and web pages in the Safari browser. They\u2019ll also be able to sum up meetings notes, text messages and emails. And Apple is planning a catch-up feature for missed notifications, allowing users to quickly absorb what they missed when they weren\u2019t looking at their phones.\nAnother part of this is reply suggestions. The iPhone will be able to automatically create fully fleshed-out responses to emails and text messages on behalf of the user.\nSiri will be a part of the new AI push as well, with Apple planning a revamp to its voice-control service based on large language models \u2014 a core technology behind generative AI. For the first time, Siri users will be able to have precise control over individual features and actions within apps. For instance, people will be able to tell Siri to delete an email, edit a photo or summarize a news article. Over time, Apple will expand this to third-party apps and allow users to string multiple commands together into a single request. These features are unlikely to arrive until next year, however.\nXcode, Apple\u2019s software for developing apps, is getting a big AI infusion too. It will work similarly to Microsoft Corp.\u2019s GitHub Copilot, which can complete code for programmers automatically. Though Apple has already been using this new developer tool internally, it\u2019s unlikely to release it in its full form to third-party developers until next year.\nThe Mail app is getting a big upgrade as well. It will include a Gmail-like feature that automatically categorizes incoming messages.\nOne feature that will likely get a lot of attention among Gen Z \u2014 and perhaps the rest of the population \u2014 will be AI-created emoji. This will use AI to create custom emoji characters on the fly that represent phrases or words as they\u2019re being typed. That means there will be many more options than the ones in the standardized emoji library that has long been built into the iPhone.\nVoice Memos will get a much-needed AI infusion, with the company adding the ability to automatically transcribe recordings. That\u2019s a feature that Google Pixel devices and many third-party voice recording apps have had for years.\nAI is coming to the Photos app as well, which will embed new capabilities into photo editing. That will make it easier to enhance an image or remove a person or object from the frame.\nOther Apple Software Upgrades\nFor decades, Apple\u2019s industrial design team dictated the look and feel of all of the company\u2019s products, ensuring that the software running on devices matched the clean lines and simplicity of the hardware. Now, customers are going to get a bit more say. In the latest iPhone operating system \u2014 iOS 18, codenamed Crystal \u2014 app icons will no longer have to remain in a neat grid. Instead, users will be able to place icons wherever they choose on their home screen. Moreover, icon colors will be customizable for the first time. That means users could make all their social media apps blue or finance-related icons green. All together, it\u2019s considered to be the biggest upgrade to the home screen in the iPhone\u2019s 17-year history.\nControl Center, another core part of the iPhone operating system, will get an updated interface that allows shortcut buttons to be rearranged within the Control Center view itself and placed across multiple pages. It will also have a new music widget and an updated interface for controlling smart home appliances.\nThe Settings app, which has remained generally unchanged since the first version of the iPhone, is getting updated on iOS, iPadOS and macOS with a focus on improved navigation, better organization and more reliable search.\nThe Messages app is getting some non-AI tweaks, including a change to the effects feature \u2014 the thing that lets you send fireworks and other visual elements to the people you\u2019re texting. Users will now be able to trigger an effect with individual words, rather than the entire message. There will be new colorful icons for Tapbacks, which let you quickly respond to a message with a heart, exclamation point or other character (they\u2019re currently gray). And users will have the ability to Tapback a message with any emoji. There\u2019s another frequently requested feature coming as well: the ability to schedule a message to be sent later. And Apple announced last November that it will be bringing RCS \u2014 or rich communication services \u2014 to the iPhone later this year, reversing a long-held stance. That will make it easier to share messages with Android users.\nApple is launching a Passwords app for iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS 15 that will offer an alternative to the 1Password and LastPass services. This will essentially be an app version of the company\u2019s long-existing iCloud Keychain feature, which is currently hidden in the Settings app.\nThe company has revamped the Calculator app and is bringing it to the iPad for the first time. On the iPad and Mac, the app will use the same overall interface \u2014 with round buttons \u2014 as the existing iPhone version.\nCalendar is getting some updates, including the ability to bring in data from the Reminders app. But the two apps aren\u2019t getting combined on iOS or macOS.\nThe Health app is getting some upgrades, including improved blood pressure data management \u2014 in preparation for future Apple Watches to have hypertension detection. There also will be support for a new hearing test feature on Apple\u2019s AirPods. The earbuds are getting a new hearing-aid feature as well, but this may not be announced until later this year. The Health app, meanwhile, will better tailor data, such as cycle tracking, if a person is pregnant.\nThe watchOS 11 update, codenamed Moonstone, will add an updated Siri interface that uniquely formats responses depending on the type of query. There are also major changes coming to some key apps such as Fitness.\nSafari in macOS 15, codenamed Glow, is getting some changes, but it seems unlikely that Apple is going to unveil its own ad blocker \u2014 something that\u2019s been reported as a possibility. Advertisers already pushed back heavily against Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency, or ATT, in iOS 14 a few years ago, and the company doesn\u2019t need another privacy-related headache.\nApple\u2019s devices are getting new wallpaper packs, including Mac versions that reference old school icons and slogans. The iPhone wallpapers will have options that look similar to early ones on the phone.\nThe company\u2019s newest product, the Vision Pro, won\u2019t get a major overhaul with visionOS 2 \u2014 codenamed Constellation \u2014 but the software will include features like new environments, the Passwords app and Vision Pro versions of iPad software. That should make the experience a bit more polished. Overall, the software is more focused on filling in gaps from the first version rather than breaking new ground.\nHardware and What\u2019s Coming Later\nWWDC usually focuses on software, but the company has used the conference to unveil devices as well. Last year, Apple showed off the Vision Pro for the first time. But this time, we\u2019re in a lull between releases. The next wave of devices aren\u2019t expected until the fall, so there shouldn\u2019t be any new hardware announcements next week.\nStill, the conference will set the stage for what\u2019s to come. The new health features will be fundamental to upgraded Apple Watches in the fall. And the new AirPods enhancements will be core to multiple new models coming later this year. The AI features, meanwhile, should help Apple sell new iPhones and Macs with upgraded chips over the next year and beyond.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon\nIsraeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War\nThe World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\nChina\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\nGrieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Brian Heater ",
        "Text": "On Monday at WWDC 2024, Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence, its long-awaited, ecosystem-wide push into generative AI. As earlier rumors suggested, the new feature is called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences.\n\"Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more,\" CEO Tim Cook noted. \"And of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It\u2019s personal intelligence, and it\u2019s the next big step for Apple.\"\nThe company has been pushing the feature as integral to all of its various operating system offerings, including iOS, macOS and the latest, visionOS.\n\"It has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\" Cook said. \"It has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences. Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more and of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up. Together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It's personal intelligence, and it's the next big step for Apple.\"\nSVP Craig Federighi added, \"Apple Intelligence is grounded in your personal data and context.\" The feature will effectively build upon all of the personal data that users input into applications like Calendar and Maps.\nThe system is built on large language and intelligence models. Much of that processing is done locally according to the company, utilizes the latest version of Apple silicon. \"Many of these models run entirely on device,\" Federighi claimed during the event.\nThat said, these consumer systems still have limitations. As such, some of the heavy lifting needs to be done off device in the cloud. Apple is adding Private Cloud Compute to the offering. The back end uses services that run Apple chips, in a bid to increase privacy for this highly personal data.\nApple Intelligence also includes what is likely the biggest update to Siri since it was announced more than a decade ago. The company says the feature is \"more deeply integrated\" into its operating systems. In the case of iOS, that means trading the familiar Siri icon for a blue glowing border that surrounds the desktop while in use.\nSiri is no longer just a voice interface. Apple is also adding the ability to type queries directly into the system to access its generative AI-based intelligence. It's an acknowledgment that voice is often not the best interface for these systems.\nApp Intents, meanwhile, brings the ability to integrate the assistant more directly into different apps. That will start with first-party applications, but the company will also be opening up access to third parties. That addition will dramatically improve the kinds of things that Siri can do directly.\nThe offering will also open up multitasking in a profound way, allowing a kind of cross-app compatibility. That means, for instance, that users won't have to keep switching between Calendar, Mail and Maps in order to schedule meetings, for example.\nApple Intelligence will be integrated into most of the company's apps. That includes things like the ability to help compose messages inside Mail (along with third-party apps) or just utilize Smart Replies to respond. This is, notably, a feature Google has offered for some time now in Gmail and has continued to build out using its own generative AI model, Gemini.\nThe company is even bringing the feature to emojis with Genmoji (yep, that's the name). The feature uses a text field to build customized emojis. Image Playground, meanwhile, is an on-device image generator that is built into apps like Messages, Keynote, Pages and Freeform. Apple is also bringing a stand-alone Image Playground app to iOS and opening up access to the offering via an API.\nImage Wand, meanwhile, is a new tool for Apple Pencil that lets users circle text to create an image. Effectively it's Apple's take on Google's Circle to Search, only focused on images.\nSearch has been built, as well, for content like photos and videos. The company promises more natural language searches inside of these applications. The GenAI models also make it easier to build slideshows inside of Photos, again using natural language prompts. Apple Intelligence will be rolling out to the latest versions of its operating systems, including iOS and iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia and visionOS 2. It's available for free with those updates.\nThe feature will be coming to iPhone 15 Pro and M1 Mac and iPad devices. The standard iPhone 15 will not be getting the feature, likely owing to limitations of the chip.\nAs expected, Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI that brings ChatGPT to offerings like Siri. The GPT 4.0-powered feature utilizes that company's image and text generation. The offering will give users access without having to sign up for an account or pay a fee (though they can still upgrade to premium).\nThat's arriving for iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year. The company says it will also be bringing integration to other third-party LLMs, though didn't offer much detail. It seems likely that Google's Gemini is near the top of that list.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EYoV1kZWkThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-is-the-companys-new-generative-ai-offering/\n"

        "Author": "  MICHAEL LIEDTKE ",
        "Text": "CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Apple has jumped into the race to bring generative artificial intelligence to the masses, spotlighting a slew of features Monday designed to soup up the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nAnd in a move befitting a company known for its marketing prowess, the AI technology coming as part of free software updates later this year is being billed as \u201cApple Intelligence.\u201d\nEven as it tried to put its own stamp on technology's hottest area, Apple tacitly acknowledged during its World Wide Developers Conference that it needs help catching up with companies like Microsoft and Google, which have emerged as the early leaders in AI. Apple is leaning on ChatGPT, made by the San Francisco startup OpenAI, to make its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri smarter and more helpful.\n\u201cAll of this goes beyond artificial intelligence, it's personal intelligence, and it is the next big step for Apple,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said.\nSiri's optional gateway to ChatGPT will be free to all iPhone users and made available on other Apple products once the option is baked into the next generation of Apple's operating systems. ChatGPT subscribers are supposed to be able to easily sync their existing accounts when using the iPhone, and should get more advanced features than free users would.\nTo herald the alliance with Apple, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sat in the front row of the packed conference, which was attended by developers from more than 60 countries.\n\"Together with Apple, we\u2019re making it easier for people to benefit from what AI can offer,\" Altman said in a statement.\nBeyond allowing Siri to tap into ChatGPT's storehouse of knowledge, Apple is giving its 13-year-old virtual assistant an extensive makeover designed to make it more personable and versatile, even as it currently fields about 1.5 billion queries a day.\nWhen Apple releases free updates to the software powering the iPhone and its other products this fall, Siri will signal its presence with flashing lights along the edges of the display screen. It will be able to handle hundreds of more tasks \u2014 including chores that may require tapping into third-party devices \u2014 than it can now, based on Monday's presentations.\nApple's full suite of upcoming features will only work on more recent models of the iPhone, iPad and Mac because the devices require advanced processors. For instance, consumers will need last year's iPhone 15 Pro or buy the next model coming out later this year to take full advantage of Apple's AI package, although all the tools will work on Macs dating back to 2020 after that computer's next operating system is installed.\nThe AI-packed updates coming to the next versions of Apple software are meant to enable the billions of people who use the company's devices to get more done in less time, while also giving them access to creative tools that could liven things up. For instance, Apple will deploy AI to allow people to create emojis, dubbed \u201cGenmojis\u201d on the fly to fit the vibe they are trying to convey.\nApple's goal with AI \u201cis not to replace users, but empower them,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, told reporters. Users will also have the option of going into the device settings to turn off any AI tools they don't want.\nMonday's showcase seemed aimed at allaying concerns Apple might be losing its edge with the advent of AI, a technology expected to be as revolutionary as the 2007 introduction of the Phone. Both Google and Samsung have already released smartphone models touting AI features as their main attractions, while Apple has been stuck in an uncharacteristically extended sales slump.\nAI mania is the main reason that Nvidia, the dominant maker of the chips underlying the technology, has seen its market value rocket from about $300 billion at the end of 2022 to about $3 trillion. The meteoric rise allowed Nvidia to surpass Apple as the second most valuable company in the U.S. Earlier this year, Microsoft also eclipsed the iPhone maker on the strength of its so-far successful push into AI.\nInvestors didn't seem as impressed with Apple's AI presentation as the crowd that came to the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters to see it. Apple's stock price dipped nearly 2% Monday.\nDespite that negative reaction, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives asserted in a research note that Apple is \u201ctaking the right path.\u201d He hailed the presentation as a \u201chistorical\u201d day for a company that already has reshaped the tech industry and society.\nBesides pulling AI tricks out of its bag, Apple also used the conference to confirm that it will be rolling out a technology called Rich Communications Service, or RCS, to its iMessage app. The technology should improve the quality and security of texting between iPhones and devices powered by Android software, such as the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel.\nThe change, due out with the next version of iPhone's operating software, won't eliminate the blue bubbles denoting texts originating from iPhones and the green bubbles marking text sent from Android devices \u2014 a distinction that has become a source of social stigma.\nIn another upcoming twist to the iPhone's messaging app, users will be able to write a text (or have an AI tool compose it) in advance and schedule a specific time to automatically send it.\nMonday's presentation marked the second straight year that Apple has created a stir at its developers conference by using it to usher in a trendy form of technology that other companies already had employed.\nLast year, Apple provided an early look at its mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, which wasn't released until early 2024. Nevertheless, Apple's push into mixed reality \u2014 with a twist that it bills as \u201cspatial computing\u201d \u2014 has raised hopes that there will be more consumer interest in this niche technology.\nPart of that optimism stems from Apple's history of releasing technology later than others, then using sleek designs and slick marketing campaigns to overcome its tardy start.\nBringing more AI to the iPhone will likely raise privacy concerns \u2014 a topic that Apple has gone to great lengths to assure its loyal customers it can be trusted not to peer too deeply into their personal lives. Apple did talk extensively Monday about its efforts to build strong privacy protections and controls around its AI technology.\nOne way Apple is trying to convince consumers that the iPhone won't be used to spy on them is harnessing its chip technology so most of its AI-powered features are handled on the device itself instead of at remote data centers, often called \u201cthe cloud.\u201d Going down this route would also help protect Apple's profit margins because AI processing through the cloud is far more expensive than when it is run solely on a device.\nWhen Apple users make AI demands that requiring computing power beyond what's available on the device, the tasks will be handled by what the company is calling a \u201cprivate cloud\u201d that is supposed to shield their personal data.\nApple's AI \u201cwill be aware of your personal data without collecting your personal data,\u201d Federighi said.\n"

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) kicked off its big push into generative AI with the debut of its Apple Intelligence platform at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday.\nBut if you own an iPhone 15 or older, you\u2019re out of luck.\nApple says you\u2019ll need an iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max or future iPhone to take advantage of the software. That\u2019s because the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are the only iPhones with processors powerful enough to handle the AI platform.\nAnd despite coming out at the same time as the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with older, less capable chips.\nThat\u2019s certainly a letdown for people who bought an iPhone 15 this year expecting it to stay updated with the latest software for at least more than a year.\nApple, however, wins by ensuring that anyone who wants to use Apple Intelligence and doesn\u2019t have its top-of-the-line phones will need to pay up or go without.\nApple is taking a more holistic approach to generative AI than its peers, spreading its Apple Intelligence software out across its existing apps like Photos and Messages and improving the functionality of apps like Siri, which will now be far more responsive and intelligent thanks to both Apple\u2019s AI models and help from OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nIt\u2019s an enormous upgrade, and one the company hopes will make older iPhone users want to upgrade sooner than later.\nSee, one of Apple\u2019s biggest problems is that its phones last a long time. IPhones get years' worth of security and operating system updates. And unless their batteries die or their screens crack, users hold on to them without feeling the need to upgrade every year.\nAccording to a 2023 survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, 61% of iPhone users had their previous iPhones for two or more years. Another 29% held onto their previous phone for three years or more.\nUBS analyst David Vogt, meanwhile, says that a recent analysis of 7,500 smartphone users from the US, UK, China, Germany, and Japan found that the average age of consumers\u2019 iPhones is 21 months, up from 19.9 months last year.\nBy only bringing its AI features to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, Apple is incentivizing users to ditch their older phones for newer offerings more quickly, speeding up the usual replacement cycle.\n\u201cWith the advent of Apple Intelligence, we see replacement cycles shrinking, creating a stronger replacement dynamic,\u201d BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a recent investor note.\nStill, Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t even available to users yet, and a big part of whether it will drive any sales comes down to how Apple delivers on the promises it made about the software during WWDC.\nWe\u2019ve seen companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announce and debut their own AI offerings only to have to rework or pull them back following consumer pushback. Microsoft had to make changes to its Recall feature before it even hit the market over concerns that it presented a security risk.\nRecall is designed to take screenshots of what you\u2019ve been doing on your PC so you can go quickly and easily access it. But security researchers said it could lead to hackers being able to view your data with ease.\nGoogle, meanwhile, had to address problems with its AI Overview for Search that told users it was alright to do things like add glue to pizza to keep the cheese from sliding off and eat rocks.\nApple will need to ensure that its own AI products don\u2019t run into similar problems, which could keep some users from upgrading.\nNow the company just has to wait and see how well its Apple Intelligence works during its early beta periods. We\u2019ll learn how many people actually want to buy their next smartphone based on the software when it lands later this fall.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "We\u2019re less than a week out from Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which kicks off on June 10 at the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. This year the company is expected to unveil its big generative AI push with new capabilities for the iPhone.\nThe moves are likely to energize investors who have been anxiously awaiting Apple\u2019s foray into generative AI. But don\u2019t expect generative AI itself to spur a new iPhone sales supercycle this year. That\u2019s because when it comes to smartphones, users care more about hardware than software.\n\u201cI don't think it's going to become the primary reason why people buy an iPhone,\u201d explained Thomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. \u201cIt's more likely going to augment experiences.\u201d\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean generative AI won\u2019t power iPhone sales in the coming years. That\u2019s because as phones age and become unable to run generative AI experiences, users will inevitably have to upgrade.\nPeople generally buy new smartphones for the hardware, not software.\n\u201cThe typical consumer is not going to care [about generative AI],\u201d explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. \u201cThey want to know screen size, No. 1. Second is camera, third is battery.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another reason generative AI on the iPhone is unlikely to get people to line up outside of their local Apple Store: The software is still too new.\nMany of the consumer offerings out there are still relatively basic. Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Copilot will soon provide helpful tips on how to fix common PC issues, and Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) Gemini for Workspace makes drafting emails easier. But by and large, there\u2019s no must-have generative AI app.\nEven Microsoft\u2019s AI-centric Copilot+ PCs are more interesting for their new Qualcomm (QCOM) chips, which are supposed to rival Apple\u2019s own M3 processors, than for the AI software they\u2019re named after.\n\u201cIf you go to Joe and Jane Smith on Main Street, USA, and say to them, 'Hey, you can have Gen AI in your iPhone,' now they're going to say, 'Great. Now, what do I do with it?' And that's the \u2026 intersection that we find ourselves at right now,\u201d explained IDC research director Ramon Llamas.\nAccording to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, Apple will roll out a new, smarter version of Siri that will allow you to control apps with your voice and transcribe recordings, new photo editing tools, and enhanced notifications, all powered by generative AI.\nSure, making Siri useful would be a huge step in the right direction, though it will be interesting to see how often people end up using the voice assistant. After all, when was the last time you asked Siri to do anything other than set a cooking timer or find out the weather for the next day?\nTranscription and photo editing tools would also be helpful, but Google and Samsung already offer those features in their own phones, and they don\u2019t seem to be driving sales. And it's likely Apple will also offer its own take on transcription and photo apps.\nMore importantly, we\u2019ll have to wait to see how iPhone developers end up using generative AI technologies to improve their own third-party apps. Think about it. You likely spend most of your time on your iPhone using third-party apps like WhatsApp, TikTok, or Gmail. The same will be true with generative AI-powered apps, but it\u2019ll take time for developers to get them up and running.\nWhile generative AI might not kick off a sales bonanza this year, it will get consumers to pony up for new iPhones in the coming years. That\u2019s because generative AI features will require some of Apple\u2019s latest chips, and users with older phones will either be unable to use those functions or they\u2019ll run slowly. And nothing makes people want to buy a new phone more than when apps are slow.\n\u201cIt'll take six months, a year, two, three years, for people to start to understand that the hardware that they had pre-generative AI isn't performing as well as your phone,\u201d Munster said. \u201cThe battery won't last, because it will be putting more weight on the CPU or the AI chip \u2026 things like that. I think that this iPhone AI upgrade cycle, it's like a two- or three-year cycle.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say Apple might not see a sales bump in September when it releases its next iPhone. The smartphone market, in general, is starting to turn around after a two-year slog. According to IDC, global smartphone sales should improve by 4% year over year in 2024. The majority of that, however, will come from Android sales, though iPhone shipments should improve some 0.7%. Not exactly a staggering number, but an increase, nonetheless.\nAs for the sales boost, that\u2019s more likely to come further down the line as Apple fine-tunes its generative AI features and developers fire off more generative AI-powered apps that tax older iPhones. As for the supercycle, it\u2019ll just have to wait.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Everything Apple announced at its big AI event",
        "Author": "  Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN ",
        "Text": "Apple just kicked off a brand new era for the company with the introduction of its first generative AI features for the iPhone.\nAt its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, the company unveiled the first batch of tools powered by \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d from personalized Genmoji \u2013 Apple\u2019s AI-generated emoji \u2013 to a significantly smarter Siri, which can answer questions about your schedule, what\u2019s in your email and what time your loved one\u2019s flight is landing.\nIt also announced a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to power the features. Although the partnership will likely give the company a much-needed boost, Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust, facing criticism for taking user inputs and incorporating them into ChatGPT\u2019s data set may cause some challenges down the road.\nApple emphasized privacy and security during its presentation, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone, keeping inputs away from a far-off server cloud.\nA big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was passed this week by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US.\nThe company said it\u2019s been impressed with the generative AI tools already on the market, but wanted to make it more personal with privacy in mind.\n\u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more. And, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up.\u201d\nThe timing is also noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at what Apple announced at its big event:\nApple is embracing generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions \u2013 through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record, essentially turning it into an iPhone chatbot.\nThis could enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. It can also perform more advanced tasks, such as answering when a user\u2019s mom\u2019s plane is landing, by analyzing information previously sent in an email. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and respond accordingly.\nThis is not unlike what some competitors have already introduced in generative tools. Siri will also likely adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues.\nUsers will also be able to create personalized photos, such as taking a picture of your mom and making it into a stylized, cartoon-y version, adding a superhero cape. It can take action across apps, including asking the software to pull up all photos of a family member, and retrieve and analyze data from across your apps, such as factoring in what\u2019s on your screen like email or a calendar.\nIf a meeting is being rescheduled, Apple Intelligence can process relevant personal data and see the email your kid sent days before about a recital, alerting users if there may be a conflict.\nIn a Q&A following the keynote, Cook once again said the company is taking privacy and security very seriously with the rollout of the new technology.\n\u201cWe think AI\u2019s role is not to replace users but to empower them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think about what\u2019s possible, it has to be integrated with the experience and be intuitive, and informed by your personal context and knowledge of you. If you\u2019re going to do that, there\u2019s a lot of responsibility.\u201d\nApple kicked off its iOS 18 portion of the event by highlighting new controls and personalization coming to iOS 18, including a revamped look for all icons when it goes into Dark Mode, a new tint color that compliments wallpaper and a redesigned control center that is available from the lock screen, so you can swap the flashlight icon for other tools.\nApple said it is also doubling down on privacy and security, such as giving users the option to \u201clock\u201d certain apps, making them accessible only via Face ID, Touch ID or a user\u2019s passcode. The feature could be especially helpful to protect apps like a banking app, an insurance app, or if you\u2019re handing your phone over to show off photos or get someone\u2019s phone number.\nUsers can now also \u201chide\u201d an app, so it will show up only in a locked, hidden folder. And media from hidden apps won\u2019t show up anywhere else on their phone.\nText messages are getting a bump, too. The company said it will soon let people send texts via satellite, even if they don\u2019t have a cell or WiFi connection. Apple is also adding what it called one of the most requested features in iMessage: the ability to schedule messages\n.iPhone users will now be able to record and create transcripts of calls right from the phone app. All parties to the call will be notified when it is being recorded.\nThe company also made software updates to other products, including the Mac, AirPods and Apple Watch.\nApple showed off its latest MacOS software called Sequoia, with a handful of new productivity features. Phone mirroring, for example, will bring iPhone alerts directly to the laptop that show up directly next to Mac notifications.\nMacOS will also support the ability to arrange windows open on screen in certain areas, such as side by side \u2014 a concept popularized by Microsoft Windows.\nVideo conferencing is getting a presenter preview, so users can see what they\u2019re going to share before they share it. Apple is also introducing background replacements on calls, so users can hide the laundry behind them.\nMeanwhile, AirPods users will be able to answer or decline a call with just a nod or shake of their head. And new vital sign tracking on Apple Watch can notify users when they may be getting sick, based on signals like body temperature and heart rate.\nJust a few months after its launch, Apple showed off a few upgrades coming to the software that powers its Vision Pro mixed reality headset.\nDuring its most recent earnings call, Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c[We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d he added.\nVision OS 2 promises to offer more rich experiences for users, such as a wider display for work stations, new hand gestures that let you check battery life or open up the home screen, and get deeper inside the photos in your library, thanks to advanced machine learning that provides more natural depth.\nThe company said it is also adding more capability for users to capture spatial videos.\nApple is also bringing Vision Pro to more countries, including the UK, China, Japan Singapore and Australia, this summer.\nUpgrades could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499. Demand for Apple\u2019s new headset has\u00a0reportedly\u00a0been weak.\nCNN\u2019s Clare Duffy contributed to this report\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference next week promises to be a pivotal moment in the iPhone maker's history. Though the Vision Pro debuted at last year's event, don't expect hardware to be the main attraction at WWDC 2024, which kicks off Monday at 10 a.m. PT.\nWWDC is for developers, and much of the focus will be on iOS 18. The Cupertino tech giant will showcase how it's chosen to integrate AI technology into its devices and software, including through a historic partnership with OpenAI. As the big event nears, all sorts of leaks have emerged about what iOS 18 and its rumored AI-powered apps and features have in store.\nAmong the changes, Apple is said to be powering some of its new AI features with its Ajax LLM. Other reports indicate that Apple plans to process data from AI in a way that even employees won't be able to access, which would help Apple continue to deliver on its promise of data privacy for its users.\nBelow, we'll take a look at how Apple is said to be adding AI to its apps and services in the next big update for the iPhone, alongside other improvements and changes coming to iOS 18.\nApple's digital assistant is prepared to get an AI revamp. The digital assistant will leverage Apple's own large language models and will allow Siri to control individual features inside applications. This will work without any necessary setup by developers or users, like App Intents or Siri Shortcuts currently require. Instead, users will be able to ask Siri to do things like delete an email or edit a photo.\nSome of Siri's upgraded AI capabilities won't be ready until next year. For example, the ability for Siri to handle tasks with multiple steps is likely delayed.\nA more advanced Siri will also come to Apple Watch for on-the-go use. You could use Siri on your Watch to play music on another device, one report said.\nSiri will receive more natural-sounding voices.\nSiri will be able to summarize notifications that include people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates and more.\nCould Siri's new look be hinted at in the animations below?\nhttps://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1797654910944919861\nA new interface is being teased.\nPeople will have the ability to retouch photos with AI, perhaps challenging Google Photos in this area.\nA \"Clean Up\" feature would, for instance, let you remove objects from your photos using generative AI technology, similar to Google's Magic Eraser.\nOne report noted that Apple made an internal-only application called Generative Playground that uses GenAI to create and edit images. It's unclear how this functionality will be presented to end users, though iMessage integration was spotted in the form of an app extension.\nAI recaps of Safari web pages and news articles will be available through a new Intelligent Search feature. (Watch out, Arc?)\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2024/05/29/is-apple-planning-to-sherlock-arc\nUsers will be able to ask for AI recaps of Notes.\nGenAI will also help to transcribe audio in Notes.\nIn-app audio recording will be supported alongside audio transcription and AI summarization.\nMath Notes will help users create graphs and solve equations through AI by recognizing the text of mathematical equations and then helping you to solve them.\nNotes users may also have the option to auto-complete their mathematical equations when typing.\nProject Greymatter is the code name for a set of AI tools that are being integrated into core like Safari, Photos and Notes, Bloomberg reported.\nReal-time transcription for voice memos is also coming.\nGenerative AI emojis will be supported, letting users create their own emojis with technology.\nAI recaps of missed texts will also be available.\nOverall deeper Siri integration is expected.\nTapbacks will get new icons.\nMessage effects for individual words will be supported in addition to effects for the message itself.\nMessages will offer suggested replies generated by Apple's on-device Ajax LLM to make texting back easier.\nRCS support is also expected to arrive this year to bring read recipes, typing indicators and high-quality video and images when texting with Android users via iMessage.\nApple's LLM will be able to communicate with the Calendar app to check for events when composing responses to messages.\nMail will also get suggested email replies generated by Ajax.\nProject BlackPearl is the code name for the AI upgrade that's enhancing Apple Mail.\nSearch within Apple Mail will include information from Contacts, locations, and locally stored documents.\nUsers may be able to ask Siri to make their emails \"sound more professional\" among other things.\nSettings will hopefully get less confusing with a revamped interface and updates that include better organization and improved search.\nA new Music widget will be available \u2014 possibly to feature larger artwork?\nImprovements to HomeKit for smart home integrations.\nAI recaps of missed notifications will be available.\nApple is working on something called \"Enhanced\" notifications.\nSpotlight is expected to get faster, more reliable search.\niOS 18 will bring the ability to place app icons wherever you want, instead of having to align them to the grid without spaces in between them.\nUsers will also be able to change the color of app icons, perhaps as Apple's answer to Google's Material You.\nMaps will support custom route creation in iOS 18, which lets users design their own routes for a trip.\nApple Music may take on Spotify with its own AI-powered auto-generated playlists.\nOther apps with planned updates include Freeform, Xcode and Apple's productivity apps, like Keynote and Pages, which may get GenAI features.\nWe\u2019re launching an AI newsletter!

        "Author": "  Samuel Stolton and Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is withholding a raft of new technologies from hundreds of millions of consumers in the European Union, citing concerns posed by the bloc\u2019s regulatory attempts to rein in Big Tech.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho\nYouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor\nVolkswagen Invests $5 Billion in EV Startup Rivian to Form Joint Venture\nFedEx Stokes Investors With Hint of a Freight Deal\nNvidia Rout Takes Breather as Traders Scour Charts for Support\nThe company announced Friday that it would block the release of Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing from users in the EU this year, because the Digital Markets Act allegedly forces it to downgrade the security of its products and services.\n\u201cWe are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\nThe EU\u2019s DMA forces dominant technology platforms to abide by a long list of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts. Tech services are prohibited from favoring their own offerings over those of rivals. They\u2019re barred from combining personal data across their different services; blocked from using information they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them; and have to allow users to download apps from rival platforms.\nAs part of the rules, the EU has designated six of the biggest tech companies as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d \u2014 powerful platforms that require stricter scrutiny. In addition to Apple, that list includes Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc.\n\u201cGatekeepers are welcome to offer their services in Europe, provided that they comply with our rules aimed at ensuring fair competition,\u201d the European Commission said in response to Apple\u2019s plans.\nApple Intelligence \u2014 the company\u2019s suite of AI services \u2014 was the highlight of its recent Worldwide Developers Conference presentation, which also included updates to the iPhone maker\u2019s operating systems. The technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. The push also includes a revamped version of Siri, Apple\u2019s once-pioneering digital assistant.\nThe new features helped spur a rally in Apple shares in recent weeks. The stock has climbed about 9% since the WWDC presentation on June 10, propelling the company\u2019s valuation to more than $3.2 trillion. The shares were up 0.4% to $210.48 as of 2:19 p.m. in New York on Friday.\nApple\u2019s decision to halt the rollout in the EU will mean consumers in all 27 of the bloc\u2019s nations, including the likes of France, Germany, Spain and Italy, won\u2019t have access to the company\u2019s ambitious new AI technologies for now. The software is due to launch elsewhere this fall, but will only work on a subset of Apple\u2019s devices and just in American English.\nIt\u2019s not clear how the features might violate the DMA, but withholding the technology threatens to irk consumers in the region \u2014 who might potentially put pressure on regulators.\nAs part of the move, iPhone mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing also will be held back. The mirroring feature lets you use your device virtually on your Mac display and have full control over it. The SharePlay capability, meanwhile, lets you screen-share from an iPad or iPhone to another device and control it remotely for technical support.\nApple executives have already locked horns with the EU over attempts to rein in the market power of Big Tech. The company is set to receive a formal warning from EU regulators under the DMA as early as Monday over how it allegedly blocks apps from steering users to cheaper subscription deals on the web \u2014 a practice for which it already received a \u20ac1.8 billion ($1.9 billion) fine from Brussels regulators earlier this year, under traditional antitrust law.\nThe Apple Intelligence rollout is facing complications in other parts of the world as well.

        "Text": "Apple Intelligence, Apple's new generative AI offering, won't just be a consumer-facing feature; developers will be able to take advantage of the latest technology, too. In Apple's keynote address at WWDC 2024 on Monday, the company announced that developers would be able to integrate the experience powered by Apple Intelligence into their own apps.\nApple's SDKs (software development kits) have been updated with a variety of new APIs and frameworks that will allow app makers to do things like integrate the Image Playground \u2014 or GenAI image creation \u2014 with just a few lines of code. Apple showed off how an app like Craft could use this offering to make users' documents more visual by allowing them to add AI images.\nAI-powered writing tools will also be automatically available in any app that uses the standard editable text view. For this, Apple demonstrated how an app like Bear Notes would automatically be able to allow users to rewrite, proofread and summarize their notes.\nIn addition, Apple is building more ways for developers to take actions in apps with Siri.\nDevelopers who have already adopted SiriKit \u2014 an SDK for integrating Siri into their apps \u2014 will see immediate enhancements for many of Siri's new capabilities without any extra work on their part, Apple said. This includes areas like Lists, Notes, Media, Messaging, Payments, Restaurant reservations, VoIP calling and Workouts.\nIn its Developer keynote, Apple said that there are two new Siri capabilities that developers will be able to benefit from without additional work. First, Siri will be able to invoke any item from an app's menus. That means a user could say something like \"show my presenter notes\" when in their slide deck or even something more conversational, like \"I need to see my speaker notes.\"\nSecondly, Siri will be able to access any text displayed on the page using Apple's standard text systems. This will allow users to reference and act on text on the screen. For instance, if you had a reminder or note to \"wish grandpa a happy birthday,\" you could just say \"FaceTime him\" to take action on that note.\nMeanwhile, Apple's App Intents framework, which allows for lightweight app-like interactions without the app being installed, will also gain access to Apple Intelligence.\nApple is defining new intents and making them available to developers across categories starting with a subset of categories including Books, Browsers, Cameras, Document Readers, File Management, Journals, Mail, Photos, Presentations, Spreadsheets, Whiteboards and Word Processors.\nThese intents are defined and tested so they're easier for developers to adopt, Apple claims.\nWith the intents, a photo-editing app like Darkroom could leverage the Apply Filter intent so users could just say \"Apply a cinematic present to the photo I took of Ian yesterday\" to have the app take action. More domains will be added in time.\nInitially, users will be able to develop with the Shortcuts app but over time, Siri will gain the ability to call the app intents in the supported domains.\nPlus, Apple shared in its keynote address, apps that fit an existing SiriKit domain will be able to benefit from Siri's enhanced conversational capabilities, like responding correctly even if you stumble over your words or understanding references to an earlier part of the conversation.\nSiri will also be able to search data from apps using a new Spotlight API that enables app entities to be included in its index. These entities refer to Apple Intelligence's semantic index of things like photos, messages, files, calendar events and more.\nAlso on Monday, the company announced its own password-manager app, AI-generated Bitmoji and Calculator for the iPad.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EYoV1kZWk\nThis post was updated after publication with more information from the Developer keynote. \nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-brings-apple-intelligence-to-developers-via-sirikit-and-app-intents/\n"

Nvidia's value briefly eclipsed Apple's last week.\nAt its annual developer event on Monday, Apple unveiled an improved Siri virtual assistant that can answer a wider range of queries and accomplish more complicated tasks than earlier versions, and several AI features across its apps that will be shipped with the latest operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.\nAt least 13 analysts raised their price targets on Apple's shares after the developer event, with some saying the latest features could encourage a cascade of new purchases as the company prepares to announce a new line of iPhones in autumn.\n\"Apple is demonstrating that it is invested in evolving its platform and devices to enable the next era of computing, interfaces and experiences,\" Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Shubham Batra in Bengaluru and by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Bill Berkrot)\n"

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) unveiled a host of software updates for its most important software offerings, including iOS, the operating system that powers the iPhone, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, and more. The updates bring a variety of changes to Apple's devices, ranging from an upgraded Photos app for the iPhone to a new Vitals app for the Apple Watch.\nThe features also come as the company rolls out its artificial intelligence strategy across its various products and services. The company announced its new Apple Intelligence generative AI platform, complete with an upgraded version of Siri and access to OpenAI's GPT-4o for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. More on that here.\nHere are the biggest upgrades coming to Apple's devices later this year.\nThe latest version of iOS, dubbed iOS 18, will feature a new customizable home screen for the iPhone that allows you to rearrange icons as you want them to appear, so you no longer have to keep them in a rigid grid as you've had to since the iPhone first debuted in 2007. You'll also be able to change the color of your apps' icons to give them a personalized look.\nControl Center is also getting major improvements, allowing you to add and reconfigure app shortcuts to third-party apps. On the privacy front, Apple announced a new feature called Lock An App, which requires users to use Face ID to unlock and access certain apps. A new hidden folder option will also let you hide specific apps on your iPhone.\nThe Messages app, meanwhile, will now include the ability to schedule text messages and text effects like animated words and emojis that pop off the screen. The Mail app will sport a new look with on-device categorizations that will drop your messages into sections like primary emails, promotions, or updates from other notes.\nApple is also finally bringing Rich Communication Services (RCS) to its Messages app. The feature means that iPhone users will be able to send high-quality images, videos, and encrypted texts to Android users. You'll still, however, have to deal with those obnoxious green chat bubbles.\nApple's Wallet app will now include a tap-to-cash feature that lets you quickly pay a friend using Apple Cash by tapping your phones together.\nGame Mode is also coming to iPhone. In this mode, your iPhone will automatically reduce background activities to ensure games run smoothly without lags.\nThe Photos app for iOS 18 gets a major design update that puts a photo grid of the entire library at the top of the screen and a filter button that allows you to organize images. You can also explore photos via the People and Pets section, which lets you view groups of photos of specific people and, well, pets.\nApple's iPadOS 18 comes with many of the same features as iOS 18, including the new Photos app and customizable home screen. The software will also come with new updates for things like SharePlay, which lets you take control of another user's iPad to help them navigate and adjust settings. The company is also bringing the Calculator app to the iPad, something that's been missing for quite some time. The app will include a Math Notes feature that will let you write mathematical equations on your screen using the Apple Pencil and have the iPad instantly solve them for you.\nApple also announced its visionOS 2, the second iteration of the operating system that powers the Vision Pro headset. The company says that the AR/VR device's Photos app will now give you the option to turn traditional 2D shots into 3D-style photos using machine learning, so you'll be able to see your photos from different perspectives.\nThere are also new ways to navigate the operating system, such as holding up your open hand to bring up the home screen. Mac Virtual Display, which lets you mirror your Mac's display on the Vision Pro, is also getting an update to create larger virtual screens, and Apple says it's adding train support for using the Vision Pro on the go when you're riding the rails. The feature is meant to keep the display from moving in strange ways while you're en route. There's a similar option for flights.\nApple says Vision Pro is also coming to more countries including China, Japan, and Singapore in June and European countries in July.\nApple's watchOS 11, for its part, sports a new training mode that can tell how your workouts are impacting your body over time. The watch will use an algorithm to estimate how much you exert yourself during exercise. You'll then be able to rate your exertion level from 1 through 10. The Apple Watch will then use that data to help you understand how much your training is helping you to improve over time.\nYou'll also, thankfully, be able to pause your exercise rings, allowing you to tell your Apple Watch if you're taking a day off from working out or if you've got an injury that's keeping you from being able to exercise.\nA new Vitals app for the watch will be able to give you a deeper look at your overall health and tell you when your heart rate, temperature, and sleep are out of sync with your normal ranges.\nMacOS Sequoia, which powers Macs and MacBooks, brings along many of the features found in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, including Math Notes for the Calculator app and more expressive texts in Messages, as well as a new iPhone Mirroring function that lets you wirelessly access and control your iPhone from your Mac.\nYou'll also be able to move your apps around your screen, positioning them in different quadrants so that you'll be able to make the most out of your display real estate. The Safari browser, meanwhile, comes with the ability to summarize articles while stripping out distractions from web pages, which is sure to affect online advertisers.\nApple is also releasing a new version of its gaming toolkit to bring more Windows-based games to Macs and MacBooks. The company has been working to push deeper into gaming for years, and it appears to be paying off as more developers begin releasing titles for the company's systems. Case in point: Ubisoft announced that its latest \"Assassin's Creed\" title will be available for the Mac as well as iPhone later this year.\nApple traditionally rolls out its latest software updates during the fall, with iOS launching alongside the iPhone. You can expect iPadOS, visionOS, watchOS, and macOS to land around the same time.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Aditya Soni and Max A. Cherney ",
        "Text": "By Aditya Soni and Max A. Cherney\n(Reuters) -Apple unveiled a long-awaited AI strategy on Monday, integrating its new \"Apple Intelligence\" technology across its suite of apps including Siri and bringing OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices.\nIn the nearly two-hour long presentation at Apple's annual developer conference, executives including CEO Tim Cook touted how voice assistant Siri would be able to interact with messages, emails, calendar, as well as third party apps. Siri will be able to write emails and change the tone of voice to suit the occasion.\nLong known for a focus on user safety, the iPhone maker also signaled it plans to differentiate itself from rivals Microsoft and Google by placing privacy \"at the core\" of its features.\nBut Wall Street - looking for more dazzling AI features and reassurance that would put Apple in good standing to compete on AI with market-leader Microsoft - was lukewarm on the event. Apple shares closed down nearly 2%.\nApple's stock, which trails those of other Big Tech firms this year, had rallied 13% last month in the run-up to the event.\n\"There isn't anything here that propels the brand ahead of its as-expected trajectory of incrementalism,\" said Dipanjan Chatterjee, analyst at Forrester.\n\"Apple Intelligence will indeed delight its users in small but meaningful ways, it brings Apple level with, but not head and shoulders above, where its peers are at.\"\nApple's approach contrasts with the enterprise-first focus of its rivals. The company hopes these moves will convince its more than 1 billion users - most of whom are not tech aficionados - on the need for the nascent technology.\nApple executive Craig Federighi called Apple Intelligence \"AI for the rest of us.\"\nApple still remains overly reliant on sales of the iPhone and some analysts said any boost from the new AI features was unlikely to materialize in the short term.\n\"In this early race, it feels that Alphabet, and even more so Microsoft, are in better shape following their initial moves and with thanks to their cloud assets,\" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst and founder of PP Foresight.\nThe AI features announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference will come with the latest operating system for its devices, which were also demonstrated at the event.\nApple uses the event at its Cupertino, California, headquarters each year to showcase updates to its own apps and operating systems as well as to show developers new tools they will be able to use in their apps.\nSIRI REVAMP\nThe revamped Siri will have more control, helping it do what has proven tricky in the past because the assistant needed to understand the user's exact intentions as well as how the app works.\nSiri will also tap ChatGPT's expertise and seek permission from users before querying the OpenAI service as part of Apple's tie-up with the Microsoft-backed startup, a privacy feature that Apple emphasized.\nBut the tie-up immediately sparked questions over privacy.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said on X that he would immediately ban Apple devices at his companies if the iPhone maker integrates the startup's tech at the OS level.\nThe ChatGPT integration will be available later this year and other AI features will follow, Apple said, adding that the chatbot could be accessed for free and that users' information will not be logged.\nLater on Monday, Apple released a paper detailing how its features, including those powered by OpenAI would ensure safety of customer data. This includes handling more complex tasks by Apple's servers under a new offering called Private Cloud Compute.\nApple also said it plans to add technology from other AI companies on its devices amid reports that it was discussing a potential tie-up with long-time search partner Google.\nTo power the AI features, Apple plans to use a combination of on-device processing and cloud computing. That means the AI features will only be available on the latest iPhones starting with iPhone 15 Pro, as well as upcoming models.\nThe company, which has long opposed cloud processing of consumer data over privacy concerns, said its approach would offer more privacy protections as it plans to use in-house chips in data centers come baked with security features.\nAnalysts have said that the use of its own chips could also help Apple avoid spending on Nvidia's pricey chips.\nApple said the new iOS 18, the software powering its flagship device, will make the iPhone home screen more customizable.\nIt will come with a \"lock an app\" feature that will help people protect sensitive information. Users can opt to lock specific apps and keep data more tightly controlled in the OS.\nThe company is also making its mixed-reality headset Vision Pro available in eight more countries including China and Japan. The new VisionOS 2 software for the headset will use machine learning to create natural depth photos and come with new gestures.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis, Max A.

The technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. The push also includes a revamped version of Siri, the company\u2019s once-pioneering digital assistant.\nThe shares gained 7.3% to $207.15, marking their first record high of the year. Investors initially had a tepid reaction to the event, with the stock price virtually unchanged in premarket trading \u2014 a not-uncommon reaction when Apple debuts long-anticipated new features. Shares of some key Apple suppliers, meanwhile, sank overnight.\nApple is making a high-stakes bid to catch up with rivals in the booming AI market. After falling behind tech peers like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp., the company is counting on a streamlined interface \u2014 and loyal customer base \u2014 to regain ground.\n\u201cThis is a moment we\u2019ve been working toward for a long time,\u201d Senior Vice President Craig Federighi, who oversees software engineering, said at the event. He described Apple Intelligence as \u201cAI for the rest of us,\u201d alluding to an old slogan about the Mac computer.\nApple formally announced a partnership with OpenAI, which Bloomberg reported on before the event. This will let customers access ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year, but some features \u2014 including the ability for Siri to precisely control features within apps \u2014 won\u2019t come until next year. Support for languages beyond English also won\u2019t arrive until later.\nOpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman was at Monday\u2019s event and wrote on the social media site X that he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to be teaming up with Apple. While the ChatGPT integration will be free, paid subscribers to OpenAI will get additional features over time. Apple, which has also held talks with Google about using that company\u2019s Gemini feature, said it plans to support other services later. Shares of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, spiked as much as 1.5% during Apple\u2019s keynote on Monday but were little changed on Tuesday.\nEnsuring that customer data is secure was a major theme of the presentation. A system called Private Cloud Compute will help keep users\u2019 information safe when it\u2019s being sent to data centers, Federighi said. Apple Intelligence will also support AI-created emoji called Genmoji and automated photo editing.\nApple\u2019s iOS 18 and iPadOS \u2014 its iPhone and iPad software \u2014 will get features that improve customization, productivity and communication. Some additions will include:\nAn upgraded home screen will let users place icons anywhere. App icon colors can also be changed, and they can be tinted when the device is placed in dark mode.\nA new Control Center includes support for third-party controls, multiple pages of settings and an updated look.\nThe iPhone 14 and more recent models will get support for text messaging via satellites. That was previously available in emergency situations.\nThe Messages app will have the ability to schedule a text to be sent later. The Tapbacks feature, which lets users quickly respond to texts with things like a heart or question mark, will now work with an emoji or digital sticker.\nCustomers can set up effects \u2014 such as a shaking word \u2014 for individual words and phrases, rather than entire texts. And there\u2019s rich text support, which will make it easier for Apple customers to communicate with Android users.\nA Passwords app will manage secure logins, passkeys and Wi-Fi account details.\nA redesigned Photos app will use artificial intelligence to improve editing.\nThere\u2019s the ability to lock any app behind Face ID.\nThe iPad gets the Calculator app for the first time, and it will let people solve handwritten math equations using an Apple Pencil. That app\u2019s absence from the iPad was a longstanding issue among customers, and the new feature was announced to applause at Monday\u2019s event.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company also rolled out macOS Sequoia, which includes the same Apple Intelligence features as the iPad and iPhone.\nSome of its other enhancements:\nThe ability to receive and interact with iPhone notifications.\nThe ability to drag and drop files between devices.\nMirroring an iPhone\u2019s display so it can be used on a Mac\u2019s screen.\nThe ability to organize Mac application windows as tiles that stick to different portions of the display.\nAnd the company unveiled visionOS 2, the latest version of its software for the Vision Pro headset. That has new features for photos and handling office work, including:\nThe ability to turn regular photos into 3D spatial pictures.\nNew hand gestures for opening the Home View and Control Center.\nA new version of the Mac Virtual Display feature that can create a virtual wraparound screen.\nThe ability to AirPlay content from an iPhone, iPad or Mac into the Vision Pro.\nApple also announced plans to launch the Vision Pro internationally, with preorders beginning in China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore on June 13. The device will go on sale in those areas June 28. That will be followed by Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK. Preorders will begin in those countries June 28, and sales will start July 12.\nNew AirPods software, meanwhile, will make it easier to hear users\u2019 voices during a phone call by removing background noise. The Apple Watch will get additional health capabilities, such as enhanced pregnancy tracking and an app that shows at-a-glance vital statistics.\nBut the AI features were the biggest focus of the event. Those tools will also include the ability to transcribe phone calls and voice memos, solve advanced math equations, sort through email, and prioritize notifications.\nNever miss an episode.

Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever\nTech Hits Stocks as Nvidia Extends Selloff to 13%: Markets Wrap\nThe two companies aren\u2019t in discussions about using Meta\u2019s Llama chatbot in an AI partnership and only held brief talks in March, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. The dialogue about a partnership didn\u2019t reach any formal stage, and Apple has no active plans to integrate Llama.\nThe preliminary talks occurred around the time Apple started hashing out deals to use OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gemini in its products. The iPhone maker announced the ChatGPT agreement earlier this month and said it was expecting to offer Gemini in the future.\nApple decided not to move forward with formal Meta discussions in part because it doesn\u2019t see that company\u2019s privacy practices as stringent enough, according to the people. Apple has spent years criticizing Meta\u2019s technology, and integrating Llama into the iPhone would have been a stark about-face.\nApple also sees ChatGPT as a superior offering. Google, meanwhile, is already a partner for search in Apple\u2019s Safari web browser, so a future Gemini deal would build on that relationship.\nSpokespeople for Apple and Meta declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the two companies were in talks about an AI partnership.\nApple unveiled a suite of artificial intelligence features at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. The new technology \u2014 called Apple Intelligence \u2014 includes homegrown tools for summarizing notifications, transcribing voice memos and generating custom emoji.\nBut Apple\u2019s chatbot technology isn\u2019t as advanced as that of rivals, prompting it to seek out partners. The company also believes that customers will want the ability to switch between different chatbots depending on their needs, similar to how they might hop between Google and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Bing for searches.\nApple continues to talk to AI startup Anthropic about eventually adding that company\u2019s chatbot as an option, the people said. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year as part of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nThe current deal with OpenAI doesn\u2019t involve money swapping hands, but Apple will allow paying ChatGPT customers to access their subscriptions within the iOS operating system. That could generate revenue for OpenAI, a percentage of which could be headed to Apple in the form of App Store commissions.\nMeta and Apple were on friendlier terms a decade ago, when the iPhone maker was integrating Facebook into iOS. But the companies have become fierce rivals in recent years, competing over AI, home devices and mixed-reality headsets.\n\u2014With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\nCorporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash\nWhy BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford\nHow to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

For instance, Apple will deploy AI to allow people to create emojis, dubbed \u201cGenmojis\u201d on the fly to fit the vibe they are trying to convey.\nThe full suite of upcoming AI features will only work on the recent iPhone 15 line because the functions require advanced processors. But there are still plenty of upgrades for all iPhone owners.\nHere are some of the best new features coming to iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence.\nScheduled texts, tap backs and RCS\nApple confirmed that it will be rolling out a technology called Rich Communications Service, or RCS, to its iMessage app. The technology should improve the quality and security of texting between iPhones and devices powered by Android software, such as the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel.\nIn another upcoming change to the iPhone\u2019s messaging app, users will be able to write a text (or have an AI tool compose it) in advance and schedule a specific time to automatically send it.\nAnd Apple is introducing a series of animated tap backs to allow users to instantly reply with any emoji or sticker, giving its app abilities similar to other messaging platforms like Google Chat or WhatsApp.\nAI tools and data privacy\nApple's new AI platform, dubbed \"Apple Intelligence,\" will use Siri to help carry out actions between apps and boost the assistant's range of capabilities.

There will be functions that can help you write text and change the tone of it as well, similar to other popular gen AI platforms.\nBut the tech firm is trying hard to convince consumers that the iPhone won\u2019t be used to spy on them. Apple is harnessing its chip technology so most of its AI-powered features are handled on the device itself instead of at remote data centers, often called \u201cthe cloud,\u201d thus keeping users data local.\nWhen Apple users make AI demands that requiring computing power beyond what\u2019s available on the device, the tasks will be handled by what the company is calling a \u201cprivate cloud\u201d that is supposed to shield their personal data.\nMore screen customization and control center options\niPhone users will have more options to arrange apps, resize icons and widgets on the home screen when iOS 18 arrives. A new dark mode look and tinting effect will also be available for further customization.\nThe control center has also been redesigned to give users access to more one tap functions, and the ability to add some third-party app options \u2014 such as remote starting your car \u2014 to it.\nCollecting your passwords\nAll of Apple's platforms \u2014 iPhone, iPad, Mac and Vision Pro \u2014 are getting a new dedicated Passwords app.\nThe new app lets you access all of your passwords in one place, including Wi-Fi passwords, and allow you to access some authentication tools. Apple also claims the app will alert you when certain passwords are compromised.\n"

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) took the leap into generative AI, debuting its Apple Intelligence platform at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. It\u2019s a massive shift for the company, bringing a host of new features to its various operating systems and products.\nApple certainly isn\u2019t the first company to debut generative AI capabilities for its software or devices. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) both debuted their own AI chatbots and services in 2023 and updated them with new capabilities during their respective developer conferences earlier this year. But Apple is unique in how it\u2019s positioning its AI service. Samsung also has its own Galaxy AI services, which use the company's own AI models as well as Google Gemini models.\nRather than introducing a digital know-it-all, however, Apple, is presenting Apple Intelligence as a personalized AI platform designed to understand your data and provide it to you when you need it most. It\u2019s a subtle distinction but one that acts as a key differentiator for Apple as it seeks to prove that its approach is the one consumers will find most useful.\n\u201cWhen we think about what it means for intelligence to be really useful, it has to be centered on you,\u201d said Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi. \u201cWe think AI's role is not to replace our users but to empower them. \u2026 It needs to be integrated into the experience you're using all the time. It needs to be intuitive, but it also needs to be informed by your personal context, really, knowledge of you.\u201d\nApple is creating a personal kind of AI experience in a number of ways, including a new and improved version of Siri that is contextually aware of your data. For instance, imagine you have to pick your mother up from the airport but don't know what time she gets in.\nYou'll be able to ask Siri when your mom\u2019s flight is landing, and the assistant will find the appropriate messages your mother sent you about her flight via email or text, then check real-time flight data to give you the exact time her flight lands.\nSiri will also be able to understand the content on your screen. Say your friend sends you an address followed by a series of unrelated texts. You can tell Siri, \u201cSave this address to their Contact Card,\u201d and Siri will recognize that you want to save that particular address to your friend\u2019s Contact Card without having to say your friend\u2019s name over again.\nSiri isn\u2019t the only place you\u2019ll find Apple Intelligence. Apple says it\u2019s using the technology to help prioritize notifications, putting priority messages and app alerts at the top of your notifications stack and even summarizing long threads to help you catch up without having to scroll through endless messages.\nLike Google and Samsung, Apple has also added generative AI-powered photo editing features and the ability to summarize and rewrite text in Mail and other apps.\nBut generative AI raises privacy concerns since data is regularly shared back and forth with the web. And it could be especially problematic for Apple to intertwine so much of your personal data with generative AI apps. To that end, Apple says it is using a number of on-device AI models that don\u2019t share your data with cloud-based services.\nFor requests that are too complex for on-device models, Apple says it will connect to its own specialized cloud services it calls Private Cloud Compute that run on Apple\u2019s own servers powered by its own chips, which the company says ensures requests remain secure. What\u2019s more, the company says that when users make requests, only a small amount of necessary data goes up to the cloud.\nApple further points out that its servers have no storage options for user data, so it won\u2019t save any of the information it uses in your requests. The software powering Private Cloud Compute is also publicized so that it can be audited by security researchers.\nBasically, the company wants users to know that while some AI prompts will use cloud-based AI models, your user data won\u2019t end up being used to train future Apple models or live on Apple\u2019s servers in perpetuity.\nApple isn\u2019t only using its own AI models. It has also partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the company\u2019s devices. But Apple says you\u2019ll be asked whether you want to use the service every time you try to access it before anything is sent to the OpenAI\u2019s servers. The company says it\u2019s also working to integrate other AI models including Google\u2019s Gemini.\nApple Intelligence will be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Macs and iPads running its M1 chip and newer later this fall. And if the company is successful in its effort to make generative AI truly useful for the average user, it could set Apple up as one of the industry leaders in the still-nascent space.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference event kicks off Monday, June 10, from the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with a keynote by CEO Tim Cook. One of the most anticipated Apple events in years, WWDC 2024 is expected to serve as the launch point for the company\u2019s big push into generative AI.\nWall Street is eager to find out what Apple\u2019s been cooking up over the past few months as its rivals have begun rolling out, or in some cases rolling back, their own generative AI offerings. Apple has been largely on the sidelines of the AI conversation, save for a few fleeting mentions during earnings calls and the like.\nDuring the company\u2019s Q2 call in May, Cook seemed to tee up potential AI news from WWDC while touting Apple\u2019s capabilities in both hardware and software.\n\"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration; groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry-leading neural engine; and our unwavering focus on privacy,\" he said.\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Apple\u2019s marketing chief Greg Joswiak posted on X, formerly Twitter, that WWDC will be \u201cAbsolutely Incredible!\u201d and made sure to capitalize both words. Get it? AI.\nIn addition to unveiling its broader AI strategy, Apple will also debut the latest versions of its various operating systems, including iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and the first major updates to the company\u2019s visionOS, which powers the Vision Pro mixed reality headset.\nStill, everything else is virtually guaranteed to take a back seat to Apple\u2019s AI news.\nAccording to Apple soothsayer Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the highlight of WWDC 2024 will be a new generative AI-powered version of Apple\u2019s Siri smart assistant. The feature will allow Siri to control individual features within apps, making it far more versatile than the Siri on your current iPhone.\nSiri has been languishing for years, proving more useful for setting timers and playing songs on Spotify than acting as a true digital helper. But a generative AI version of Siri offers the promise of an actual smart assistant that could provide you with everything from proactive tips to improved responses to those random questions that pop into your head throughout the day.\nBloomberg\u2019s Gurman also said Apple\u2019s AI features, called Apple Intelligence, will touch a host of other apps, including Messages, Notes, and Safari.\nExactly how Apple will power a smarter Siri is still an open question. According to reports from Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times, Apple has held talks with OpenAI to license its GPT software and separate talks with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to license its Gemini software.\nA tie-up with either company could get complicated. OpenAI already works closely with Microsoft (MSFT), which is working to set its PC business apart from Apple by boasting about how some Windows 11 features are powered by GPT-4o. Google, meanwhile, uses its Gemini AI model on its Android smartphones, which compete directly with Apple\u2019s iPhone. Google is also working with Samsung to provide AI software for that company\u2019s Galaxy line of phones.\nIt will also be interesting to see if consumers or Wall Street end up more excited about Apple\u2019s AI rollout. Investors and analysts have been waiting for Apple to debut some kind of answer to the generative AI explosion, but so far consumer use cases have been relatively limited.\nIf Apple does roll out some well-developed features, they\u2019re unlikely to get consumers to drop everything and buy a new iPhone come September when the company debuts its newest phones. Instead, most consumers will probably wait until they see some kind of hardware upgrade or until their current phone becomes unbearably slow before ponying up for a new device.\nAs for iPadOS and macOS, expect Apple to roll out the same AI features it adds to iOS across those operating systems as well. In general, I expect Apple to be rather judicious with its AI moves. The company is keenly attuned to how consumers perceive its products, and after the blowback competitors like Google and Microsoft have seen with their own AI stumbles, it\u2019s hard to imagine Apple will announce anything it isn\u2019t completely confident in.\nOutside of AI, Apple is also expected to unveil Rich Communication Services, or RCS, for the iPhone. This means that users will finally be able to text high-quality images and videos to their Android friends. RCS is also more secure than the SMS standard Apple currently uses for iPhone-to-Android texting.\nGurman also said that Apple will finally allow people to arrange app icons on their iPhone home screen in any way they want, rather than being stuck with the traditional grid layout.\nThere are bound to be plenty more announcements from the big show, and Yahoo Finance will be there live, bringing you all of the latest news as it breaks.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "In the end, Apple\u2019s highly-anticipated AI announcements were very, well, Apple-y. You could practically feel that bite in the tech giant\u2019s fruit logo as the company finally announced Apple Intelligence (how deliciously on-brand to take advantage of the technology\u2019s initials), which Apple\u2019s Tim Cook touted will be \u201cpersonal, powerful, and private\u201d and integrated across Apple\u2019s app and hardware ecosystem.\nApple, of course, has always been all about being a protective \u201cwalled garden\u201d that provides comprehensive security measures but also plenty of restrictions for users, and Apple Intelligence will be no different. But it is that very personal context of the user within the Apple landscape, combined with the power of generative AI, that makes Apple Intelligence something perhaps only Apple could really do.\nApple has not been first, or anywhere near the cutting edge of generative AI, but it is betting on something else: An AI \u2018for the rest of us\u2019 \u2014 for the billions of users who don\u2019t care about models or APIs or datasets or GPUs or devices or the potential for artificial general intelligence (AGI). That is, the \u2018normies\u2019 \u2014 as those in the tech industry like to call them \u2014 who simply want AI that is easy, useful, protective of privacy and just works.\nThe laundry list of features Apple executives promised to roll out across iPhone, iPad and Mac OS devices was long. Siri is getting an upgrade that makes the assistant \u201cnatural, more contextually relevant, and more personal.\u201d If Siri can\u2019t answer a question itself, it will ask the user if it\u2019s OK to tap into ChatGPT (thanks to a new deal between Apple and OpenAI) and it will have \u201con-screen awareness\u201d that will eventually allow Siri to take more agent-like action on user content across apps.\nThere will be new systemwide writing tools in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, as well as new ways for AI to help prioritize everything from messages to notifications. The fun factor is well-represented as well, with on-device AI image creation and the fittingly-named Genmojis, which let users create custom emojis on-the-fly (think: smiley face with cucumbers on the eyes to indicate you're at the spa).\nBut unlike Google and Meta\u2019s throw-everything-at-the-wall approach to integrating generative AI to their products, Apple is taking a different tack, putting a carefully designed layer of gen AI on top of its operating system. None of it, at least in Monday\u2019s demo, seems bolted on as an afterthought (like Meta\u2019s AI-is-everywhere search bar in Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, for example). And none of it, in fact, really uses the word AI as in \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d\nThe re-branding of AI as Apple Intelligence takes a technology consumers have heard and read about for more than a year (and which has often sounded frightening, futuristic and kind of freaky), and serves it up as something that's soothingly safe and secure. It\u2019s the tech equivalent of a mild soap for sensitive skin, offering consumers a freshly-scrubbed face with no hard-to-pronounce and potentially irritating ingredients.\nOf course, Big Tech demos are notorious for big announcements that don\u2019t always deliver. And there were few details about important issues like the provenance of the data powering Apple Intelligence features, the terms of Apple's deal with OpenAI for access to ChatGPT, and how Apple plans to deal with the inevitable hallucinations that will result from its AI output. After all, safe and secure does not mean \u201caccurate.\u201d When Apple Intelligence is released \u201cin the wild,\u201d things are sure to get interesting, and messier.\nThe tech world is in a fierce battle to see which company will be able to take AI and turn it into the industry\u2019s next game-changer. Whether that is Apple or not remains to be seen, but the elegant simplicity of the Apple Intelligence announcements certainly puts Google, Meta, Amazon and yes, OpenAI on notice: AI may be complicated, but as Steve Jobs said, \u201csimple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.\u201d Perhaps, AI companies will finally figure out how to keep it simple\u2014and as Jobs said, \u201cmove mountains.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) initial launch of the iPhone was arguably a once-in-a-generation investing opportunity. The world changed afterward -- and Apple's share price skyrocketed.\nMany investors probably also view the introduction of ChatGPT as a once-in-a-generation investing opportunity with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) in powering generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications took off and hasn't slowed since.\nBy definition, such moments with Apple and Nvidia are rare. However, no rule says a company can't have multiple game-changing catalysts during its lifetime. Perhaps both Apple and Nvidia are once again presenting once-in-a-generation opportunities. If so, is Apple a better pick than Nvidia for investors right now?\nThe \"new\" has long worn off the iPhone. Apple hasn't rolled out truly head-turning technology improvements to its popular smartphone in years. As a result, iPhone upgrades have slowed considerably.\nHowever, Apple's introduction of its new AI capabilities (called Apple Intelligence) could be a major turning point. Thus far, most AI functionality has run in the cloud. With Apple Intelligence, though, AI runs locally on the company's devices.\nThis approach is known as edge AI. It could be a massive new market opportunity that some analysts believe will spur an iPhone upgrade super cycle.\nUnsurprisingly, Nvidia's new opportunity is also related to AI, and it's more of an extension of the company's current opportunity than anything entirely new. Nvidia's next wave of growth could come from an acceleration of AI capabilities that achieves or comes close to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- a form of AI that matches or exceeds human-level performance.\nMore powerful AI systems will undoubtedly require more powerful AI chips. Nvidia's GPUs continue to set the bar for performance.\nHow could these AI opportunities pan out for Apple and Nvidia? Let's look at two potential scenarios -- one optimistic and the other pessimistic.\nIn an optimistic future, Apple's customers will flock to upgrade their iPhones and iPads to take advantage of the company's new AI features. Apple will continue to add capabilities regularly, attracting new customers who switch from rival smartphones. The company will return to double-digit growth and its iPhone ecosystem will become more valuable than ever.\nNvidia will continue to launch faster and faster chips. The pace of the company's innovation will be so rapid that no competitor will be able to keep up. As AI grows more powerful, Nvidia's technology will enjoy increasingly greater demand. The company's revenue, profits, and share price will soar.\nIn the pessimistic scenario, however, customers will ultimately view Apple Intelligence as merely a novelty. There'll be an initial modest uptick in iPhone upgrades, but nothing more. Apple's growth will be sluggish, at best, and its stock will flounder for years as a once-great company loses its way.\nAs for Nvidia, AGI or anything close to it may prove to be much more difficult to achieve than imagined. Large language models (LLMs) will reach a plateau in capability, and the demand for AI chips will decline with companies not seeing the desired return on investment.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's rivals and large cloud customers will roll out their own chips that are less expensive and compare favorably on performance with Nvidia's GPUs. Nvidia's market share -- and share price -- will fall sharply.\nNvidia has clearly been the better stock in recent years and so far in 2024. But could Apple deliver greater gains going forward? Maybe.\nI think the optimistic scenario (or something fairly close to it) is more likely for Apple than the pessimistic scenario. Although Apple's valuation is high, it doesn't have nearly as much projected growth baked in as Nvidia's does.\nSome aspects of the pessimistic scenario for Nvidia also seem quite possible. AGI could be much further away than some predict. Other chipmakers are already aiming to challenge Nvidia's AI chip dominance.\nIf the optimistic scenarios play out for both Apple and Nvidia, I believe Nvidia will continue to be the bigger winner. However, I think the pessimistic scenario is less likely for Apple than for Nvidia.\nI won't claim unequivocally that Apple is a better once-in-a-generation investment opportunity than Nvidia. My view is that both stocks should perform well for long-term investors. But for more cautious investors, Apple looks like the better pick.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) is expected to launch its next-generation AI-centric iPhone in September, but the company's Apple Intelligence software platform may not be enough to spark a new sales supercycle in 2025. That's according to UBS Global Research analyst David Vogt, who says Apple's market share losses in China to homegrown companies like Huawei, act as a \"material governor on iPhone unit growth.\"\nApple is heavily dependent on iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market by total revenue behind the Americas and Europe. In 2023, China accounted for $72.56 billion of Apple's $383.3 billion in revenue. The Americas brought in $162.6 billion, while Europe made up $94.3 billion.\nThe resurgence of Huawei, which was initially kneecapped by US sanctions on high-powered smartphone chips in 2019 but has since released phones with sufficiently advanced chips, has meant increased competition for Apple in China. That, coupled with a tepid economic environment, led to slower iPhone sales in the region in the early part of the year.\nApple has attempted to goose sales for Chinese consumers, offering deep discounts across the Greater China market. And by some measures it's working. According to Bloomberg, iPhone shipments increased as much as 50% in April and 40% in May.\nDespite those gains, Huawei could still pose a threat to Apple's growth in China. To counter that, and build sales in other regions, the company announced its new Apple Intelligence platform during its WWDC event in June. But according to Apple, the software, which infuses generative AI technologies across apps ranging from Messages and Photos to the iPhone's Calculator app, requires powerful processors only found in the iPhone 15 Pro line and, presumably, future iPhones.\nThat means users who want to take advantage of Apple Intelligence but have older iPhones or even the standard iPhone 15 will have to pony up to use the new software.\nStill, Apple isn't the only company rolling out generative AI technologies. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have already debuted their own generative AI-powered smartphones, and you can expect more Android device makers to do the same.\nSamsung is also gearing up for its annual Unpacked event next week, where it is expected to launch its newest foldable phones, while Google is aiming to announce its own updated Pixel smartphone lineup in August.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) Intelligence might have stolen the show at the company\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference this week, but another announcement during the show could literally help you stay in touch with friends and family while off the grid or camping when you don\u2019t have cell service.\nMessages via satellite is a new feature for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 coming in iOS 18 that will allow you to send iMessages, you guessed it, via satellite. Apple already offers its Emergency SOS via satellite service, but that\u2019s more geared to serious situations like when a user is lost in the wilderness or in some other kind of danger. Emergency SOS via satellite requires users to answer brief prompts about their particular situation, which Apple can then route to the appropriate authorities.\nUnlike Emergency SOS via satellite, Messages via satellite allows you to send standard iMessages to friends and family who use iPhones, as well as SMS messages to Android users. I joined Apple\u2019s senior director of platform product marketing for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, Kurt Knight, for a brief demo of the new feature and its capabilities.\nStanding outside in the sweltering California heat, Knight showed me how the process of sending texts via satellite works using an iPhone without either a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. From your phone\u2019s lock screen, you\u2019ll get a notification saying that you can send and check for messages via satellite when your iPhone detects you don\u2019t have a cellular or Wi-Fi signal.\nTap the notification and you\u2019ll be brought to a screen showing your location on a map and indicating whether there is a satellite nearby overhead. Below that are options to send messages, call for roadside assistance, use the Find My app, or use Emergency SOS via satellite.\nYou can also launch Messages via satellite by opening up the Messages app on your phone when disconnected from cellular or Wi-Fi. While using the app, you\u2019ll get a pop-up in your iPhone\u2019s Dynamic Island showing your relative position to the closest satellite. Move too far to the left or right, and the pop-up will tell you to get back in the right position to communicate with the satellite.\nYou won\u2019t be able to use the feature indoors or under heavy tree cover, since it requires a clear line of sight between the satellite and your iPhone, but it does work surprisingly quickly. During the demo, Knight was able to send both text and an emoji via iMessage, as well as one of Apple\u2019s Tapback message replies.\nThe Messages app will alert you each time you send or receive a text via satellite by adding a small note above your message\u2019s timestamp. The idea is to ensure you and the person you\u2019re texting are both aware that you\u2019re communicating via satellite and that responses might not be as fast as they would over cellular or Wi-Fi signals.\nDon\u2019t expect to send videos or photos over satellite, though. Apple says it was able to make sending normal texts possible because it was able to compress them to a size that made them easier to send back and forth to satellites. Photos and videos are just too big at this point.\nAs for how to use Messages via satellite, you\u2019ll need an iPhone 14 or newer and access to iOS 18 when it comes out later this fall. Apple hasn\u2019t said when or what it will charge for the service yet. The company initially offered iPhone 14 users a year of service for free, but then extended that for another year in 2023. IPhone 15 owners received a free year of service when they purchased their phones as well. Apple has yet to announce what will happen when those terms are up.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Apple's AI Surge: Growth Potential With Limited Margin of Safety",
        "Author": "  Kenio Fontes ",
        "Text": "From the) Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10 to the time of writing, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gained $297 billion in market cap, once again surpassing $3.20 trillion and regaining its position as the largest company in the world, although still very close to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nApple has achieved an incredible milestone, shifting perspectives and going from one of the companies that was not at the top of the artificial intelligence trend to one that will benefit greatly from it, having announced new features for its products. Most importantly, this has the power to boost growth, making it even more profitable and strengthening the moats of its ecosystem.\nOn the other hand, in this context, it is also important to analyze the company's margin of safety given all the euphoria surrounding this trend, which, however real it may be, is interesting to look for sustainable returns in relation to the company's price when investing.\nThe main highlights of the event included notable advances in Apple's Vision Pro and spatial computing, which, although still in their early stages and of little relevance to the company, are interesting. The presentation of iOS 18 brought several design improvements, including Dark Mode, new privacy features and the integration of Apple Pay between iPhones. These updates are set to significantly improve the user experience.\nThe iPad announcement also captured attention, especially with the introduction of AI designed for calculations, studying and various other activities, surpassing expectations of only announcing a calculator app for the iPad.\nMacOS (with Mac Sequoia) introduced significant innovations, such as iPhone Mirroring and improved notifications. However, the standout feature by far is Apple Intelligence, which promises advanced capabilities on devices equipped with the M1 chip and the latest iPhone 15 models. This includes a collaboration with OpenAI to integrate GPT-4 Chat into Siri, marking a big leap in artificial intelligence features on Apple devices, ranging from writing tools to integrated and personalized personal assistance.\nThe event emphasized personalization and privacy, addressing the growing concerns about these issues, especially in light of the doubts raised by other solutions such as Microsoft's Copilot+ and its Recall tool. This highlight shows how Apple, after falling behind in the AI race, has managed to turn things around and reaffirm its moats with a rebranding of the trend, turning the technology into Apple Intelligence and making great use of its ecosystems.\nBut how does all this fit in with the company's financials? Well, just emphasizing that the company is integrating AI into its devices is already good for its reputation with the market, which is valuing it highly. But it is possible to go further. First, Apple has been able to emphasize its ecosystem very well, with iPhone mirroring, Apple pay, reinforcing quality and more. But the most important thing is the company has a cyclicality in its sales model, where its products change every few years. And in recent quarters, this cycle hasn't helped boost growth. While revenue services have been showing double-digit growth in recent periods (and also mitigate some of this cyclicality), the iPhone and its other products have shown mediocre performance.\nIn the quarter ending March 2024, iPhone revenue fell by 10% quarter over quarter, while the Mac shrank by 17%. In the graph below, you can see this has been going on for some time, with iPhone sales peaking at $72 billion in first-quarter 2022 with the launch of the iPhone 13.\nSource: App Economy Insights\nAfter quarters of timid growth for the iPhone, the moment for a new boost in the cycle seems to have arrived. As already mentioned, many of the features announced, such as Apple Intelligence, will only be available for the newer iPhone 15 models and most likely also for the iPhone 16 models that will be announced in September. Therefore, it is quite possible to infer that a significant number of people who have not yet exchanged their older iPhones will do so soon.\nTo give you an idea, in January, the adoption of the iPhone 15 Pro Max was 3.60%, while that of the iPhone 15 Pro was 2.30%. Essentially,the overwhelming majority of the base uses older iPhones, so if they want to have access to these new features, they will have to upgrade.\niPhone 15 adoption rate worldwide from September 2023 to January 2024 by model:\nSource: Statista\nIt is difficult to estimate an exact amount, especially given that these features may end up impacting more people involved in the technology niche who are excited about it, while others may still take some time to want to adopt the new features and expect greater obsolescence of the device. Another crucial factor is to understand what the next cycles will be like. In 2026, will Apple once again announce important features that will not exist in the iPhone 15 and 16? How relevant could these features be? My guess is the biggest leap will be now, with a hardware upgrade to support these technologies and the next updates, however technological they may be, may attract the attention of more specific niches (which need a more powerful device for filming and other services).\nAnother factor driving this cyclicality is the macroeconomic aspects. Indicators such as inflation, interest rates, the population's disposable income and unemployment have a direct impact on Apple's products. This is true not only for sales in the U.S., but also for other countries where Apple has a smaller market share and is seen as a premium (perhaps even luxury) product. Thus, a relief in the macroeconomic cycle also helps its operations.\nIn the U.S., Apple has more than 60% of the smartphone market share, while in the rest of the world this is reversed, with Android currently accounting for just over 70%. This can be seen as an opportunity for growth, with premiumization trends in some countries. This trend should also be accelerated by the new functionalities exposed in the new products.\nSource: Backlinko\nEven with all this optimism, if you do some math, you can see that Apple's shares are not a bargain. The company's revenue for the last 12 months was $381 billion, the highest being $394 in September 2022. Let's imagine this cycle really does get stronger, and that in the next fiscal year the company reaches $430 billion (which would be extraordinary compared to recent timid growth). Let's also consider a net margin of 30%, an increase of more than 3 percentage points. This would give us a net profit of $129 billion, indicating a price-earnings ratio of 25.50.\nThe price-earnings ratio for the next 12 months based on market projections is 31, compared to an average of 24.90 over the last five years and an average of 19.90 over the last decade. The multiple in the exercise in the previous paragraph seems feasible to me at some point, but it would still be quite a challenge, and that challenge is only to get close to your average multiple.\nA multiple of between 25 and 30 for a company of such quality, which could surprise positively at some point, does not seem expensive enough to me to be bearish, especially considering AI's momentum could last for a significant period.\nA discounted cash flow model confirms there is little margin of safety in the shares. With optimistic assumptions, such as a growth rate of 12% in the first 10 years and 5% in the last 15 years, and a discount rate of 8%, there is a fair price of $193 for Apple shares, 10% lower than the current price of $212.\nIn my opinion, Apple is still going through the motions, and this was even more evident at WWDC 2024. As Steve Eisman mentioned, the current market seems to care a lot about stories as narratives seem to be more important than real fundamentals. This intensifies when we do a DCF calculation. Even with optimistic assumptions, the result is still not as attractive as it should be. As much as Apple is one of the best companies in the world, you need a certain risk premium and a margin of safety when investing.\nMy outlook is bullish for Apple's operations, believing the company will benefit from the AI cycle and remain one of the largest companies in the world. On the other hand, its current price ($210-plus per share) does not seem to justify great optimism given the limited upside, so even with optimism for the company, I would consider investing in Apple stock only at more reasonable levels that guarantee me a greater margin of safety.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  KEN SWEET ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Apple is discontinuing its buy now, pay later service known as Apple Pay Later barely a year after its initial launch in the U.S., and will rely on companies who already dominate the industry like Affirm and Klarna.\nIt's an acknowledgement from a company known for producing hit products that building a financial services business from scratch as Apple has been doing for several years is difficult and highly competitive.\nApple Pay Later launched with fanfare in March 2023 as a way for iPhone customers to split purchases of up to $1,000 into four equal payments with no fees or interest. The service was Apple's answer to the growing popularity of buy now, pay later services globally, and considered a sizeable threat to companies like Klarna, Affirm and others.\nBut Apple Pay Later was only available where Apple Pay was accepted whereas the other buy now, pay later companies had deeply integrated themselves into millions of merchant websites.\nIn an acknowledgement of how popular buy now, pay later services had become, Apple said at its developer's conference this month that it would start allowing banks to offer buy now, pay later plans to their customers through Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. Affirm would be integrated directly into Apple Wallet, and Apple customers would be able to open an Affirm account directly.\n\u201cWith the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.,\u201d Apple said late Monday. \u201cOur focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.\u201d\nApple executives as recently as this month had indicated that the company still had plans for Apple Pay Later despite announcing plans to integrate Affirm directly into Apple Wallet.\nApple Pay Later was unique because Apple needed to create its own bank to offer the loans. The Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs, which means Goldman ultimately decides who gets approved and what spending limits are for each customer.\nApple has discontinued any new Apple Pay Later loans, but customers who have existing Apple Pay Later loans will be able to manage them inside Apple Pay.\n"

The company will lay out a suite of features that it calls Apple Intelligence, people familiar with the matter have said.\nWhile Apple launched Siri in 2011, its voice technology was quickly overtaken by Alexa from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Assistant. AI took another leap with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT at the end of 2022 and rival services from Google, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and others during 2023.\nAdding to the pressure: Samsung Electronics Co. \u2014 Apple\u2019s biggest smartphone rival \u2014 integrated Google AI features into its devices earlier this year.\nThe shift to artificial intelligence promises to be a big opportunity for Apple if it can hone its technology and catch up with rivals. AI-based operating systems will change how people gather information, create and edit content, and navigate their devices.\nAt the event, Apple will show how it\u2019s weaving AI features into its next software updates: iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS 15. The company is also planning a more powerful version of Siri.\nApple Intelligence will focus on providing more information to users when they need it. That involves summarizing notifications, text messages and emails; synthesizing meeting notes; transcribing voice memos; and even creating custom emojis. The software also will be able to sort through emails and classify them into categories.\nApple also has been working on its own large language models \u2014 the technology behind ChatGPT-style services \u2014 but it\u2019s not far enough along in that area, people familiar with the matter have said. So it\u2019s planning to announce a partnership with OpenAI that will supply Apple with a chatbot.\nApple has one major advantage as it pushes deeper into AI: a massive number of loyal consumers. That could help make the company a success in AI even without breaking ground in large language models, said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.\n\u201cIt has a very powerful consumer installed base for which it can act as a channel \u2014 just like it has for search and the App Store, the two most lucrative parts of Apple\u2019s business today, outside of iPhone,\u201d he said.\nOne concern is whether the OpenAI deal means that fewer users will be using Google search on the iPhone. Apple generates billions of dollars per year through a revenue sharing agreement with Google. The terms of Apple\u2019s deal with OpenAI, meanwhile, aren\u2019t clear. And Apple is still negotiating a separate agreement with Google to eventually also add its Gemini technology as a chatbot option on the iPhone, Bloomberg has reported.\nIt\u2019s likely that Apple will eventually want to offer its own chatbots and other generative AI, but having partners helps it navigate the artificial intelligence industry without taking on as many risks. OpenAI and Google have suffered some backlash from chatbots providing incorrect information.\nApple wants to avoid that, said Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a former director of AI research at the iPhone maker and a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always watched what the space is like and have long decided they don\u2019t have to be first, but they have to get it right,\u201d he said.\nApple\u2019s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Antitrust: QuickTake\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon\nIsraeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War\nGrieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\nThe World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\nChina\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Apple Is Positioned for Growth",
        "Author": "  Lucas Wong ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its shares pick up since March, after significantly trailing behind the rest of the big tech sector. Despite a sharp recovery, the stock is currently 2% below its all-time high. Comparatively, shares are underperforming the market by about 6% in a year that has generally been very favorable for other major tech companies.\nFigure 1: Apple shares sharply recover following lackluster performance\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ACN.\nAAPL Data by GuruFocus\nThis underperformance can be attributed to Apple's lackluster growth since 2021, with declining revenue in five of the last six quarters on a year-over-year basis and several quarters of declining net income. This revenue slump has been primarily driven by poor macroeconomic conditions. However, the overall industry environment for smartphones and PCs is improving, which should support the company's product sales in 2024 and 2025. Looking ahead to the second half of 2024, several catalysts could drive Apple's performance. These include the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the reveal of Apple's generative artificial intelligence initiatives, new product launches (such as the iPad and Mac) and the iPhone 16 product cycle.\nI will explore these factors in more detail as I explain why I believe Apple is an appealing option, contrary to current investor sentiment.\nFigure 2: iPhone revenue stagnation since 2021, substantial update incoming\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\nApple is no longer a legacy tech play that's falling behind, but rather a company with an incredible moat that should be relatively immune from disruption at the hands of new AI tools and applications. Plus, with continued services growth and a potentially improved upgrade cycle with the iPhone 16, I think the stock could be ready to move higher in the coming months. It is true that growth has slowed over the last few years, but the revenue stagnation since 2021 was largely due to incremental updates in iPhone models, which have not driven substantial upgrade cycles.\nAs such, many are expecting this coming year's update to be more substantial, between the potential for iPhone 16 to outperform and continued organic growth in services, I believe that Apple's revenue and net income should continue trending up and to the right over the medium term. Being more than three years away from the last strong release positions, the company is pretty well ahead of the iPhone 16, and that's even without the generative AI contribution. So a potential OpenAI partnership, improvements to Siri and other exciting AI features in photo editing, writing, music and more should be more than enough to create a strong iPhone 16 cycle.\nWhile it is still uncertain who the ultimate winners and losers of the generative AI opportunity will be, one thing is clear: even a decade from now, users will likely access these apps through Apple's hardware and devices. This is exemplified by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) paying Apple $20 billion in 2022 for Google to be the default search engine in the Safari browser. This stability and competitive advantage present a highly attractive opportunity for Apple. Moreover, the company is well-positioned to benefit from new AI market entrants monetizing their apps through the App Store. As these entrants scale and seek a broad audience, the App Store remains one of the best platforms for it. With its monetization model, Apple is perfectly positioned to take a fee in return for providing this reach. As AI apps grow and monetize, this could significantly bolster services revenue growth. Apple is set to capitalize on the AI revolution, potentially unlocking a robust new revenue driver for its subscription ecosystem.\nAt the very least, we believe Apple will not experience material downside from being perceived as lagging in AI. All eyes are on the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, which started on June 10. Meeting expectations, the tech giant introduced its AI plans, which include a suite of tools it calls Apple Intelligence. In addition to the anticipated rollout of iOS 18, these generative AI capabilities could serve as a robust positive catalyst for the company going forward.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Apple reported revenue of $90.80 billion, down 4% from the prior year but meeting the consensus expectations of $90.40 billion, which assured investors. Product revenue was $66.90 billion, a 10% decrease year over year primarily due to the one-time impact of iPhone channel inventory replenishment from the previous year. Last year, Apple managed to fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter's Covid-19 supply disruptions for the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. Excluding this one-time impact, revenue would have been up 1% from the prior year, with iPhone revenue remaining flat. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% and aligning with consensus expectations.\nThe challenges faced by Apple's product segment are likely temporary, influenced by the harsh macroeconomic environment. Households across the developed world are contending with elevated inflation and high interest rates, which impact discretionary spending. However, demand for its products is expected to rebound as monetary policies across developed countries begin to ease. The April consumer price index showed a downtrend in the U.S. after a one-off spike in March.\nFigure 3: Second-quarter 2024 revenue and margin performance\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\nAdditionally, Apple's gross margin improved, with the total gross margin percentage increasing to 46.60% from 44.30% in the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by a different services mix and cost savings. This improvement underscores the company's ability to manage costs effectively even in a challenging environment.\nI have bullish expectations for Apple's revenue outlook, driven by several key factors. The company's strategic push into AI, including the anticipated launch of iOS 18 with generative AI capabilities, is expected to significantly enhance its product offerings. This integration will likely boost demand for new devices and applications, driving overall revenue growth. Additionally, I expect the upcoming product launches to stimulate substantial consumer interest and drive higher sales. With improving macroeconomic conditions, including easing inflation and lower interest rates, I expect a recovery in consumer discretionary spending, further supporting revenue growth.\nFigure 4: Strong margins despite weak macro conditions\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\nIn terms of margins, I expect strong growth, driven by Apple's expanding services segment. The services revenue increased by 14% year over year in the second quarter, contributing significantly to the company's overall margins. The high margins associated with services like the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud, compared to hardware sales, are expected to continue driving overall gross margin expansion as the Apple ecosystem expands through products like the Vision Pro. Further, as AI applications scale and monetize, services revenue will see exponential growth, contributing to higher margins. For the third quarter of 2024, I expect revenue to grow in low single digits year over year (in line with consensus and management expectations), with gross margins projected between 45.50% and 46.50%.\nApple boasts an unrivaled ecosystem and a balance sheet loaded with cash, giving it the ability to develop or acquire virtually any product. This combination of a strong ecosystem and a significant cash reserve presents substantial opportunities for the company. While Apple has not introduced a groundbreaking product recently, its potential to create another must-have item remains high.\nThere is ongoing speculation about potential deals, such as a partnership with Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) or an acquisition of Disney (NYSE:DIS). Although these transactions may or may not materialize, Apple's financial strength makes such moves plausible. Recently, Apple announced a $110 billion buyback, which aligns with its history of significant share repurchases, including previous authorizations of $90 billion and $100 billion. This marks the sixth consecutive year with buybacks exceeding $70 billion. Additionally, Apple has consistently increased its dividends annually for the past 12 years, recently raising the dividend by 4% to 25 cents per share for the current quarter. These actions underscore the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders while maintaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and innovations.\nFigure 5: Discounted cash flow valuation\nSource: Author's calculations\nIn evaluating Apple's future potential, we can consider several key drivers that contribute to its positive outlook. The anticipated product launches are expected to drive substantial consumer interest and sales. The growth in services revenue, fueled by the integration of AI capabilities into offerings like the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud, will further bolster the company's financial performance. As AI applications scale, they will significantly enhance user experiences and engagement, contributing to a robust and profitable services ecosystem. Moreover, the improving macroeconomic conditions, such as easing inflation and lower interest rates, are expected to revive consumer discretionary spending, further supporting revenue growth. The expanding Apple ecosystem, characterized by the seamless integration of hardware, software and services, will continue to attract and retain a large user base, driving sustained revenue growth.\nThe valuation model indicates a fair share price of $223.50, representing an upside potential of 15.80% from the current share price of $193. This projection is underpinned by a constant growth rate of 6.10%, which is supported by Apple's historical compound annual growth rate over the last three decades. The company's ability to leverage its strong operating history and financial flexibility to integrate AI capabilities positions it well to capitalize on the AI revolution. This revolution is expected to add trillions of dollars to the global economy through increased productivity, and Apple is poised to be a significant beneficiary. My confidence in the company's ability to improve its FCF margin, projected to rise to 24.30% by 2028, is based on its historically strong operating leverage and efficient cost management. Given these factors, I believe Apple presents an attractive opportunity with significant upside potential.\nApple is well-positioned for sustained growth and profitability, driven by its strategic integration of AI capabilities, robust product pipeline and expanding services ecosystem. The company's financial strength and operational efficiency provide a solid foundation for navigating economic fluctuations and capitalizing on emerging market opportunities. With a proven track record of innovation and shareholder value creation, Apple remains a compelling investment opportunity. Given the anticipated revenue and margin growth, alongside improving macroeconomic conditions, I am confident if will continue to deliver strong financial performance and drive long-term value for shareholders.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) popped on Tuesday, rising to more than $207. The move higher follows the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference, where the iPhone-maker said it will start rolling out its beta artificial intelligence (AI) software, called Apple Intelligence, this fall. Investors applauded the company's move into AI, sending shares up more than 7%.\nThe stock's sharp gain on Wednesday puts it up about 21% over the last three months. With such a steep gain in the rearview mirror, many investors are likely taking a close look at the tech stock to see whether it's a buy, sell, or hold.\nSo, do shares remain attractive today, even after soaring?\n\"We've been using machine learning and artificial intelligence for years,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook during a Tuesday keynote. Until now, computing power wasn't yet sufficient to enable the company's vision for AI across its devices, Cook explained. Hence Apple's announcement that it is bringing to market AI software called Apple Intelligence -- an AI Cook says is \"powerful,\" \"intuitive,\" \"integrated,\" \"personal,\" and \"private.\"\n\"It's the next big step for Apple,\" Cook proclaimed. Given the stock's more than 7% gain on Tuesday, many investors seem convinced the software update can fuel strong growth for the company.\nPerhaps one of the big reasons why investors are bullish on the stock's potential following the announcement of Apple Intelligence is that the AI software will only be available on recent Apple products. As far as its smartphones go, for instance, Apple Intelligence is limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max (note it's not even available on the standard iPhone 15). This could lead to a big wave of smartphone upgrades from Apple's loyal customer base as consumers look to get their hands on more AI tools.\nApple Intelligence is also limited to newer Macs and iPads. It will be available on iPad and Mac devices with M1 chips and later.\nThe iPhone, accounting for over half of Apple's annual revenue and an even larger portion of its profit, can move the needle on the company's bottom line in a big way when the product segment's sales accelerate. Analysts seem to agree with this sentiment. In response to the event, many prominent Wall Street analysts released notes to investors saying that iPhone sales may accelerate -- particularly when the company announces its latest iPhone this fall.\nSome investors, however, might argue that a potential acceleration in iPhone sales later this year was already priced into the stock. After all, shares were trading above 30 times earnings ahead of the announcement of Apple Intelligence. A premium like this prices in meaningful and sustainable bottom-line growth for years. Even more, the media was largely predicting some sort of new AI feature from Apple before the company's keynote this week.\nSo, is Apple stock a buy, sell, or hold after the stock's big gain? Given that Apple has benefited from big waves of iPhone upgrades before, it's definitely possible Apple Intelligence will bolster iPhone sales trends. For this reason, selling Apple shares at a time like this could be a mistake. But buying shares at this level, unfortunately, leaves very little margin of safety for the upbeat expectations priced into the stock. For this reason, it's probably more appropriate to call Apple stock a hold at this level. Investors, of course, should do their own due diligence to decide for themselves how attractive they think shares are.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple Intelligence Could Ignite a New iPhone SuperCycle",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit new 52-week highs recently after the Cupertino tech behemoth hosted an exciting Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple showcased many new features in the newer versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and iPadOS that will further refine its slick ecosystem. More importantly, though, Apple revealed its own AI platform, Apple Intelligence, which is set to revolutionize the user experience and initiate a new era of innovation. This could be the catalyst for a new iPhone sales supercycle. Thus, I am bullish on the stock.\nApple Intelligence could potentially serve as the key solution to a longstanding challenge that Tim Cook and his team have been grappling with: the prolonged stagnation in device sales. Take the iPhone, for instance. Apple sold 231.8 million units in 2023, not far from the 231.2 million units it sold in 2015. Sure, significant price increases led to revenue growth during this period, but selling units more often has proven difficult so far.\nThe most significant reason for the relatively flat unit sales over the years is likely the increasing durability of Apple\u2019s products. The company\u2019s relentless commitment to quality and device robustness has resulted in devices that endure and perform exceptionally well over multiple years. Moreover, incremental progress in newer models has not always provided compelling reasons for immediate upgrades, further extending the replacement cycle. I still use my iPhone 13 Pro Max, and thus far, I have not had a good reason to upgrade.\nHowever, the introduction of Apple Intelligence may potentially serve as the catalyst that triggers an all-around trend of upgrades, potentially ushering in an iPhone sales supercycle. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at how it solves the problem.\nIf you are not familiar with how Apple\u2019s ecosystem works, you may assume that Apple Intelligence will be just another AI product, maybe one that resembles ChatGPT. However, this is hardly the case. I think that Apple is on a whole different mission here. Apple Intelligence is special because its AI is integrated into iPhones, representing a significant leap in personalized technology. By leveraging access to user data within the iPhone, Apple Intelligence can deliver a highly tailored user experience, setting it apart from generic AI assistants.\nThis changes the game for several reasons. First, the personalization offered by Apple Intelligence can lead to unprecedented convenience and functionality. By knowing your habits, preferences, and routines, the AI can anticipate your needs and seamlessly automate your tasks. Did you forget to add that one item you usually include in your weekly grocery order? Imagine if Apple Intelligence would remind you just before you paid (with Apple Pay, of course).\nSecond, this is probably going to be the only AI platform with privacy and security at its core. While other AI services handle data on external servers, Apple ensures that all critical data is processed locally on your device, safeguarding your personal information. While I value the AI\u2019s ability to understand my habits and optimize my daily routine, it\u2019s crucial that this data never leaves my device. Apple is currently the sole provider, promising both a secure and personalized AI experience.\nOverall, if Apple Intelligence lives up to its promise, as demonstrated during the WWDC event, it\u2019s fair to expect a significant surge in iPhone sales. Apple\u2019s AI could be the compelling reason for iPhone users who typically upgrade every few generations to eagerly seek out the latest model. Moreover, it might be the catalyst for many Android users to switch to iPhones.\nPicture being an Android user and seeing your friend\u2019s iPhone effortlessly solving daily challenges with Apple Intelligence, tailored perfectly to their needs. Meanwhile, your experience, switching from Samsung to Huawei to Xiaomi over the years, can never provide comparable functionality. It may become clear to these users that joining the Apple ecosystem may finally offer you the seamless integration and intuitive assistance you\u2019ve been missing. This could further boost sales and widen Apple\u2019s user base.\nDespite the bullish momentum following Apple\u2019s recent presentation, which could very well be justified for the reasons I just described, investors should carefully monitor the stock\u2019s valuation. The recent rally led to Apple\u2019s forward P/E surging to 32.2x based on FY2024\u2019s earnings-per-share consensus estimate. This multiple is clearly too rich based on Apple\u2019s recent earnings growth. Instead, it reflects Wall Street\u2019s forecast for a significant earnings growth rebound\u2014one that Apple\u2019s AI platform could help power.\nStill, the current valuation heightens the stock\u2019s risk profile. If Apple Intelligence doesn\u2019t end up being the catalyst that ultimately powers a strong EPS growth trajectory, the stock could face significant headwinds as the market will have to re-rate Apple\u2019s valuation.\nWall Street\u2019s sentiment on Apple seems relatively mixed. The stock features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. However, at $210.86, the\u00a0average AAPL stock price target\u00a0implies 1.6% downside potential.\nApple\u2019s unveiling of Apple Intelligence at WWDC seems to mark a pivotal moment poised to reshape its future. By integrating AI directly into its devices while prioritizing user privacy, Apple has positioned itself for a potential iPhone sales supercycle. However, while the prospects are promising, I think that investors must tread carefully, given Apple\u2019s hefty valuation. The success of Apple Intelligence will be pivotal in justifying Wall Street\u2019s lofty expectations and avoiding a sentiment reversal sell-off.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "2 Winners and 2 Losers From Apple's Latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Announcement",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last week sparked a new interest in the stock and caused it to notch fresh all-time highs. However, there are a few winners and losers associated with its primary announcement about Apple Intelligence and its general take on artificial intelligence (AI).\nSo, who are the winners and losers of this conference? The answers may surprise you.\nTo me, there is a clear winner in this announcement: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semi's business is already doing well, but it just got a catalyst. In 2021, 2022, and 2023, sales from Apple made up 26%, 23%, and 25% of TSMC's revenue, respectively. The smartphone business has struggled recently, but that could turn around quickly.\nBecause Apple Intelligence will only be available for iPhone 15 models and newer, it isolates about 90% of iPhone users with an older generation. If Apple Intelligence becomes the latest must-have technology, it could ignite a new demand for iPhones.\nWith a large chunk of Taiwan Semi's revenue coming from this business, it would stand to benefit.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is also a huge beneficiary of this announcement. Because Apple chose to partner with OpenAI (the maker of ChatGPT), it selected the company that Microsoft has heavily invested in. This also validates its use of ChatGPT throughout its Microsoft Office suite, as it will create a fairly seamless experience for the millions of people who use Office products and iPhones daily.\nWhile the plan is for iPhones to run most of these workloads on the smartphones themselves, some of it may have to be outsourced to servers due to the arduous nature of the AI model. When that occurs, it will happen on Microsoft Azure servers because that's where OpenAI has run its technology. This will also serve as an increased revenue stream for Microsoft.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Google's parent company, finds itself on the wrong side. Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, competes with ChatGPT. Apple could have chosen Gemini as the model to run its Apple Intelligence on, as it would have been a logical continuation of its partnership.\nThis breaks a tradition of Google and Alphabet working together -- the Google search engine is the default one on Apple products because Alphabet pays for it. Recently, this was the subject of an antitrust lawsuit, which may have influenced Apple's decision to choose ChatGPT over Gemini.\nRegardless, Gemini isn't Apple's pick for its Apple Intelligence, and that's a lost opportunity for Alphabet.\nMy last loser is Apple, which may come as a surprise. Apple will likely see a surge in demand for its iPhones, which will increase sales. But that's not the point I'm trying to make.\nApple is a massive company with resources few can dream of having. It has armies of software engineers and more than $60 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of the end of its fiscal second quarter (ended March 30). Yet, it couldn't make its own generative AI model in-house?\nThis shows how far behind Apple is in the AI race, as it was caught completely off guard. Because of its partnership with an external company, there will always be questions about data security and what information is being shared with other companies. If it kept that in-house, those questions wouldn't be as relevant.\nInstead, this could be the Achilles' heel of a product that otherwise seems solid. Although Apple will likely see increased sales, the long-term ramifications of not bringing this technology in-house could be problematic for Apple.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Jeffrey Dastin and Aditya Soni\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple's developer conference on Monday was about more than infusing its software with the latest artificial intelligence technology, including from ChatGPT.\nIt was also about selling more iPhones.\nFacing choppy consumer spending and resurgent tech rivals, Apple has looked to AI as a way to invigorate its loyal fan base of more than 1 billion customers and to reverse a sales decline for its biggest-selling product.\nThe software, which requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max to operate, may encourage a cascade of new purchases, several analysts said. Some predicted the biggest upgrade cycle come autumn since Apple's release of the iPhone 12 in 2020, which drew consumers in part through 5G connectivity.\n\"What we saw today was more compelling than anything we've seen since,\" analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson said.\nShares of Apple were 3.3% higher at a record in early trading on Tuesday, after closing nearly 2% lower on Monday.\nThe company showcased what it called Apple Intelligence, its take on generative AI that can conjure text, images and other content on command.\nApple demonstrated how its AI could generate custom emojis, a cartoon to text friends or edits making an email sound more professional. Its digital aide Siri could prompt users if they wanted ChatGPT's help too.\nSome analysts voiced skepticism, predicting consumers would not race to Apple stores to get more AI on their phones.\n\"Perhaps there may be enough in the new and improved Siri-powered, intelligently Apple devices to stanch some of the device revenue that's been hemorrhaging lately, but there isn't enough to create a new band of followers,\" said Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.\nTejas Dessai of Global X added, \"Investors clearly want a more comprehensive and ambitious strategy from Apple when it comes to AI.\" The company's stock fell 2% on the news.\nUPGRADE TO AI\nLike them or not, Apple's AI features won't come to every iPhone.\nThe company said smartphone customers have to upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max that Apple began selling in September 2023. The AI, built so it can process data privately on a user's device, depends on chips in Apple's newer smartphones.\nIn Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives' view, that represents a big opportunity. He estimated some 270 million iPhones had not been upgraded in four years.\n\"We estimate 15%+ of the Apple installed base will upgrade to iPhone 16 as Apple Intelligence is the killer app many have been waiting for,\" Ives said.\nThe iPhone 16 release is expected sometime this autumn.\nGene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said another feather in Apple's cap was its easy-to-use integration with ChatGPT. \"They're really taking the friction out of using AI,\" he said.\nApple's iPhone revenue for its fiscal year that ended in September 2023 was $200.6 billion, down from $205.5 billion the prior year, the company's latest annual report showed.\nStill, AI is just a part of Apple's draw to consumers. They may primarily want a bigger iPhone display or better camera, but the AI updates would appeal to early adopters and stand apart for their ability to take actions in and across apps, said Martin Yang of Oppenheimer & Co.\n\"That action part will make Apple an immediate leader in consumer AI,\" Yang said.\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Aditya Soni in Bangalore and Max Cherney in Cupertino; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n"

        "Author": "  KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 European Union regulators on Monday leveled their first charges under the bloc\u2019s new digital competition rulebook, accusing Apple of preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store.\nThe European Commission said that according to the preliminary findings of its investigation, the restrictions that the iPhone maker imposes on developers using its mobile App Store had breached the 27-nation bloc's Digital Markets Act.\nThe rulebook, also known as the DMA, is a sweeping set of regulations aimed at preventing tech \u201cgatekeepers\u201d from cornering digital markets under threat of heavy financial penalties. The commission opened an initial round of investigations after it took effect in March, including a separate ongoing probe into whether Apple is doing enough to allow iPhone users to easily change web browsers, and other cases involving Google and Meta.\nApple has been facing pressure on both sides of the Atlantic to tear down some of the competitive barriers around its lucrative iPhone franchise.\nThe U.S. Justice Department filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple this year, accusing it of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market and boxing out competitors, stifling innovation and keeping prices artificially high. By the time that case was filed, Apple had already started to comply with a U.S. court order enabling links to alternative payment systems within iPhone apps, but a judge has expressed frustration with the company's approach and has indicated may changes may be required.\nApp makers such as Spotify had complained for years about Apple\u2019s requirement that subscriptions only be bought through iOS apps, allowing the company to take a commission of up to 30%. Those grievances culminated in European regulators slapping Apple with a $2 billion fine for unfairly favoring its music streaming service over Spotify and other rivals.\nUnder the DMA's provisions, app developers must be allowed to inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.\nThe commission, the bloc's executive arm, said App Store rules \u201cprevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content.\u201d\nApple now has a chance to respond to the findings. The commission must make a final decision on Apple\u2019s compliance by March 2025. The company could face fines worth up to 10% of its global revenue, which could amount to billions of euros, or daily penalties.\nThe regulatory tensions prompted Apple to recently raise the specter of excluding the European market from a package of new artificial intelligence features coming to iPhones because the company believes the new rules within the region are too onerous.\nBut the European commission is keeping the pressure on Apple, simultaneously opening a new investigation into contractual terms that it's offering app developers.\nRegulators zeroed in on a \u201ccore technology fee\u201d of 50 euro cents (54 cents) that Apple is now charging developers for each time their apps are downloaded and installed from outside Apple's App Store. The DMA's provisions open the way for alternative app stores to give consumers more choice.\nThe commission said the the new terms are a \u201ccondition to access some of the new features enabled by the DMA.\u201d Rivals had criticized the fee, saying it would deter many existing free apps, which don't pay any fees, from jumping ship.\n\u201cWe are concerned Apple\u2019s new business model makes it too hard for app developers to operate as alternative marketplaces & reach their end users on iOS,\u201d the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, said on social media.\nApple Inc. said over the past several months, it \u201chas made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission.\u201d\n\u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAll developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilize the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate.\u201d\nThe company said it will \u201ccontinue to listen and engage\u201d with the commission.\nThe EU had been carrying out a similar investigation since 2020 into whether Apple's in-app purchasing system and restrictions violated Brussels' antitrust rules. But \u201cto avoid multiple investigations into the very same conduct,\u201d that probe is being shut down to focus on the investigation under the DMA, which clearly spells out what Apple can't do, the commission said Monday.\n"

Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance (video above).\nFollowing Monday's event, Luria upgraded Apple to Buy from Neutral and raised his price target to $230 from $200.\nOn Monday, Apple announced \"Apple Intelligence,\" its long-awaited foray into the generative AI space. The company said the platform would be integrated across the company's hardware and software products, ranging from the iPhone and Mac to mail, messages, and photos. Apple Intelligence will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPads and Macs running Apple's M1 series chips and newer later this fall.\nKey features of the launch include updates to Siri, which will now be able to parse messages for addresses or find photos in a phone's photo library based on voice prompts. Apple also launched new software updates for its iPhones, watches, and computer products.\n\"Our experience with consumer surveys with prior generations of iPhone launches tell us that the hardware upgrade cycle is more driven by a collection of feature upgrades across diverse applications, which in aggregate will provide ... reasons to upgrade over the next few years,\" JPMorgan senior analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\nHe added, \"The release of the AI features across Mac, iPads and iPhones will support an upgrade cycle across all the devices.\"\nThe announcements capped off a month of excitement for the stock as rumors around some of the news, including a partnership with ChatGPT operator OpenAI, had already been percolating.\nAfter briefly being passed by Nvidia (NVDA), the stock of the iPhone maker is now back as the second-most-valuable company (behind Microsoft) in the world with a market capitalization of more than $3.1 trillion.\nFollowing a slow start to the year amid concerns of slowing iPhone demand, Apple stock is now up more than 15% in the past two months. Analysts like Luria and Chatterjee believe the next iPhone upgrade cycle could be on the horizon as the new AI features are only coming to iPhone 15 pro and later generations.\n\"As people buy new phones this holiday season, they're going to see this great functionality,\" Luria said. \"They're going to show their friends and family and the product upgrade cycle will happen over the next few months and quarters.\"\nThis, Luria argued, should be a key catalyst for the stock moving forward.\n\"The stock has been flat because there hasn't been revenue growth at Apple,\" Luria said. \"Now, we think that this will allow Apple's overall growth to accelerate from the low single digits into the mid-, maybe even high-single digits over the next year or two.

Apple was the first of the tech titans to receive a claim for breaching the DMA by\u00a0blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\nAltogether, the European Commission has significantly\u00a0raised\u00a0the financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators.\u00a0As a reminder, Apple already lost to Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) who accused it for\u00a0abusing\u00a0its\u00a0market dominance in\u00a0the distribution of music streaming apps,\u00a0and is appealing the court\u2019s decision and consequent $1.95 billion fine. Besides evaluating Apple\u2019s lack of compliance with giving users the freedom of choice and its steering rules, the EC is going after Alphabet to evaluate its measures to prevent self-preferencing\u00a0the Google search engine over others as well as its steering rules as well. The EC wants to make sure that Alphabet implemented measures to for Google search rivals to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.\nEU watch dogs are also going after Meta for its\u00a0pay or consent\u201d model. As a gatekeeper, the EC is concerned about Meta being a responsible gatekeeper. EC wants to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers\u00a0and will question if Meta is\u00a0obtaining\u00a0consent from users when\u00a0intending\u00a0to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services.\nSince enforcing the Digital Markets Act, the EC is showing that it will make sure that\u00a0Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft\u00a0fully comply with the rules. Although this is still a small step to holding the tech titans accountable for their actions, it is a big step in ensuring fair competition in the digital economy and regulating gatekeepers.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy and Hold Apple Stock Forever",
        "Author": "  Prosper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been around a while and has delivered market-crushing returns over its long and storied history. However, some investors and analysts now feel it's no longer worth investing in the iPhone maker. The market cap now tops $3 trillion, which limits its upside potential, especially since Apple's biggest moneymaker -- the iPhone -- no longer generates the kind of year-over-year growth in sales that it once did.\nWhile these are fair concerns, there remain solid reasons to buy Apple's shares and hold onto them for good. Let's consider three such reasons.\nHow does a company remain relevant for decades? It's generally not enough to offer necessary products or services. Even in industries such as healthcare, corporations need to innovate constantly to avoid becoming dinosaurs. That's also true -- and arguably more so -- in the tech industry where Apple operates. The company has stayed relevant and thriving for as long as it has largely because it's created a culture centered around innovation.\nApple doesn't need to be first to market. It expertly takes existing products and adds its own spin to them. That's what it did with the iPhone and many other technologies. More recently, the company finally announced its artificial intelligence (AI) plans: It will add various AI functionalities to eligible devices (including the iPhone 15 Pro and beyond). While some observers worried that Apple was getting behind in the AI race, the company has made a meaningful move.\nNo doubt there will be more to come. Beyond AI, Apple pours plenty of money into research and development (R&D) to avoid becoming a dinosaur -- and, in fact, to remain highly relevant for a long time, just as it has throughout its history. That's an excellent reason to consider the stock.\nApple's success has paid off in many ways, one of which is that it now boasts a deep ecosystem of devices and customers who use at least one of them; more than 2 billion Apple devices are in circulation. It's difficult to overstate the value of this base of customers.\nThe company knows it, too -- that's why it's ramping up its services segment, through which it offers a variety of services including Apple Music and Apple TV. Apple has more than 1 billion active paid subscriptions.\nHere's another perk of Apple's strategy to increasingly rely on services: While making and selling hardware is a relatively low-margin business, the opposite is true for the services it offers to its vast base of customers. So, over time, there's a good chance that gross and profit margins will improve. That's great for the business.\nIt's true that the services unit still doesn't provide a substantial portion of its top line. In the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (which ended March 30), Apple's services revenue came in at $23.9 billion, about 14% higher than the year-ago period.\nApple's total sales of $90.8 billion dropped by about 4% year over year, so services accounted for only roughly 26% of total sales. But that number has generally grown over the years -- it was just 10% in the third quarter of 2015. This trend bodes well for Apple's long-term prospects.\nThough Apple benefits from a deep ecosystem, can it keep most of its customers? Thanks to its competitive advantages, it should be able to do so. Apple's business benefits from the network effect, switching costs, and a strong brand name, all of which are important sources of a competitive edge.\nApple's network effect can be seen in its App Store: The more people use it, the more valuable it becomes to developers, and vice versa. That's the hallmark of the network effect: The value of services increases with use.\nApple's devices also have features that other smartphones or tablets don't have, making communication between Apple-centric devices extremely convenient. Leaving the ecosystem means leaving these behind, hence the switching costs.\nLastly, Apple routinely ranks as one of the most valuable brand names in the world. These features make it likely that its business remains solid despite stiff competition.\nLike every company, Apple faces headwinds; a decline in iPhone sales in China and antitrust lawsuits both come to mind. However, the company has more than enough going its way to appeal to investors, including an excellent dividend program. So, if you're interested, look past Apple's recent struggles and consider sticking with the company for good.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple is bringing ChatGPT, OpenAI's AI-powered chatbot experience, to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems. The tech giant announced the news during a keynote at WWDC 2024 in Cupertino on Monday.\n\"We're excited to partner with Apple to bring ChatGPT to their users in a new way,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. \"Apple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAI's mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone.\"\nSoon, Siri will be able to tap ChatGPT for \"expertise\" where it might be helpful, Apple says. For example, if you need menu ideas for a meal to make for friends using some ingredients from your garden, you can ask Siri, and Siri will automatically feed that info to ChatGPT for an answer after you give it permission to do so.\nYou can include photos with the questions you ask ChatGPT via Siri, or ask questions related to your docs or PDFs. Apple's also integrated ChatGPT into system-wide tools like Writing Tools, which allows you to create content with ChatGPT \u2014 including images \u2014 or ask an initial idea and send it to ChatGPT to get a revision or variation back.\nChatGPT integrations will arrive on iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year, Apple says, and will be free without the need to create a ChatGPT or OpenAI account. Initially, they'll be powered by GPT-4o, OpenAI's recently introduced flagship generative AI model.\nSubscribers to one of OpenAI's ChatGPT premium plans will be able to access paid features within Siri and Apple's other apps with ChatGPT integrations. Apple says that privacy protections are \"built in\" to the integrations \u2014 specifically, requests aren't stored by OpenAI and users' IP addresses are obscured.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EYoV1kZWkThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-brings-chatgpt-to-its-apps-including-siri/\n"

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While many technology stocks have surged in recent times, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has remained on the sidelines, with the shares little changed year to date. The smartphone giant has missed out on the gains as investors favor companies that have been more aggressive -- or more vocal -- about their artificial intelligence (AI) programs. While companies from Meta Platforms to Amazon have offered details of their AI investments, launched AI products, and even discussed monetization of the technology, Apple has pretty much remained hush-hush about its AI plans.\nBut that may not be the case for long. The company's Worldwide Developers Conference is set for June 10 through 14, and in Apple's most-recent earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said Apple is \"very bullish\" about the generative AI opportunity -- and Cook says he's \"looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.\"\nAll of this suggests Apple may make key announcements at the conference, ones that could outline its future role in the high-growth market of AI. Should you buy Apple shares before this big moment? Let's find out.\nFirst, let's talk about what we may expect during this year's developers conference. It's pretty much a given that Apple will announce software updates, as this has been the routine throughout the history of the annual event. This means the launch of operating-system upgrades for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other Apple products.\nThe operating system that's getting the most attention, though, is the next one for iPhone, iOS 18 -- with many Apple fans and followers predicting the iOS update may be the most significant one yet. We don't know for sure what features Apple will announce, but AI likely will play a major role.\nFor example, Apple's digital assistant, Siri, is expected to be given a big AI boost, according to Macworld. Siri would become more conversational and helpful for daily tasks. And Apple might make many AI functions happen on device rather than in the cloud in order to maximize security. Macworld also spoke of reports of Apple talking to Alphabet and OpenAI about including their technologies in the latest iOS. The Information reported this past week that Apple and OpenAI actually have cemented a deal.\nMost importantly, though, the upcoming iOS update could offer Apple a boost to near-term and long-term revenue. It may help revenue as early as this year because users with iPhones that are a few years old may have to upgrade to a new phone in order to benefit from all of the iOS 18 features. And the iOS 18 should set Apple on the path to long-term revenue growth because it starts laying the groundwork for a new type of phone, one that incorporates a significant amount of AI.\nCould Apple's announcements at the conference also kick-start stock performance? It's possible. Apple has a solid track record of earnings growth over time, but it's become a mature tech company -- and some investors have turned to other players for a better shot at growth. But if Apple announces a compelling entry into the AI space, the company could win back some of these growth-seeking investors right away and as this new Apple AI story develops.\nNow let's get back to our question: Does this mean you should buy Apple stock ahead of the June 10 conference? Yes, it's an absolutely great time to get in on the Apple story.\nThe company sells market-leading products that have kept customers coming back over time. This is Apple's moat, or competitive advantage, and it's proven its strength. At the same time, these products help Apple generate recurrent revenue as users sign up for services such as digital content or cloud storage. Finally, a big step into AI should offer Apple a new source of growth.\nTo make the deal even sweeter, Apple shares trade for only 29 times forward-earnings estimates right now, a steal considering the company's past performance and future potential.\nBut all of this doesn't mean you should buy Apple only for a potential stock-price gain around June 10. After all, it's possible that, even if Apple announces a game-changing update, the stock may not immediately take off. And that's OK.\nWhat's most important is that Apple's update actually results in earnings growth over the long run -- and there's reason to be positive about that as well as long-term stock performance.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Apple needs to make Siri fit into a ChatGPT world\u2014Is it Mission Impossible?",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s Siri was the first virtual assistant to grace our smartphones, but it only took about five years before newer competitors like Google\u2019s Assistant\u2014which could more freely search the web for answers\u2014made it seem a little clunky. Now, nearly 13 years after that 2011 launch, Siri is looking positively antiquated.\nThe advent of generative AI is to blame. Siri was always an AI assistant of sorts\u2014machine learning, which is a subset of AI, is what gives it the ability to understand spoken commands and requests\u2014but the world has come to expect so much more of AI, particularly since OpenAI's seminal release of the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022.\nApple arch-rival Google, which has one of the leading large language models in the form of Gemini, is baking a host of AI capabilities into its Android operating system\u2014most notably the Gemini chatbot itself, which is taking over from Assistant. And even on Apple's iOS, many people are now turning to apps for third-party chatbot like ChatGPT. Siri is increasingly out in the cold.\nThat may change on Monday, when Apple holds what\u2019s likely to be its most consequential Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in many years. Investors are clamoring for the company to more full-throatedly declare its enthusiasm for AI and, when it unveils iOS 18 next week, Apple will have to demonstrate that it has what it takes to at least keep up in the chatbot stakes. The obvious way to do so will be to unveil a smarter Siri\u2014one that still acts as the familiar voice interface that iPhone owners have long used to access the device's functionality, but that could also understand and do much, much more.\nBut there\u2019s a problem: Apple\u2019s most advanced under-development large language model (LLM), reportedly known internally as Ajax, isn\u2019t yet ready for primetime.\nSo, to stay in the game, Tim Cook\u2019s company has reportedly struck a deal with Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple is still talking to Google about using Gemini too\u2014it may be that iPhone users end up with a panoply of chatbots powering the answers to their queries\u2014but for now, it seems Cook will on Monday tout a mix of ChatGPT and Apple\u2019s in-house AI efforts.\n\u201cApple is playing catch-up with LLM technology, and it\u2019s probable that their AI\u2019s conversational abilities and, more importantly, cost, don\u2019t yet meet what they can get from OpenAI,\u201d said Forrester senior analyst Andrew Cornwall.\nWith the OpenAI deal now apparently a certainty, the biggest mystery about Apple\u2019s near-term AI strategy is where it will draw the line between the capabilities offered by the cloud-based ChatGPT and those that it can offer locally on the iPhone or iPad itself. Reports suggest that an algorithm will determine which type of AI would be most appropriate, depending on the sophistication of the request.\nSiri\u2019s on-device nature is part of Apple\u2019s big privacy pitch\u2014that, unlike Google in particular, Apple is not interested in exploiting its users\u2019 data. Indeed, this reluctance to learn too much about the user\u2019s interests, and to keep what is learned away from third parties, is widely seen as a key reason why Siri\u2019s capabilities remain so limited.\nIt is certainly possible to find some kind of middle ground. Apple\u2019s mobile devices have since 2017 included a neural processing unit (NPU)\u2014a specialized component for handling AI tasks\u2014that the company calls the Neural Engine. This has allowed Apple to offer things like improved image and sound recognition, language translation and various health features. The newest iterations of the Neural Engine, reportedly the version in last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro as well as whatever is inside this year\u2019s iPhones, will be what enables Apple\u2019s on-device generative AI.\nBut a tiny NPU will not be able to match the wild horsepower contained in the data centers powering OpenAI, which allows ChatGPT to provide such an uncanny simulacrum of human intelligence. So Apple will have to walk a tightrope between the privacy that its users have come to expect and the futuristic capabilities promised by a cloud-happy AI sector.\n\u201cApple is likely to announce that much of the new Siri processing is done on-device,\u201d said Cornwall, who suggested that the reported Apple-OpenAI deal \u201cwould be a stopgap measure to give Apple developers time to build an LLM that can run mostly on-device and inside Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\u201d As for requests that require OpenAI\u2019s superior technology, Apple will probably route those through its own servers so any personal data can be anonymized, he added\u2014a tactic that wouldn\u2019t just conform to Apple\u2019s privacy-first brand, but that would also \u201cpermit Apple to switch providers without disrupting its users.\u201d\nAccording to Bloomberg, the revamped Siri that Apple will unveil on Monday will be able to control the functions within apps on the user\u2019s behalf, open documents, email web links, and summarize online articles. But even if some functions are using OpenAI\u2019s technology, Apple will likely present them as improved \u201cApple capabilities\u201d rather than \u201ca front end to OpenAI,\u201d Cornwall said.\nCompany pride aside, there are good reasons why Apple may want to avoid putting its OpenAI association front-and-center. Altman has become a highly controversial figure who allegedly kept OpenAI\u2019s old board in the dark about that company\u2019s plans, so they wouldn\u2019t delay moves like the release of ChatGPT in the name of safety\u2014his lack of openness with his overseers led to his brief ouster late last year. Although he won that tussle, former OpenAI employees continue to warn about an insufficient focus on safety.\nEven if Apple does keep OpenAI at arm\u2019s length, it also faces risks around ChatGPT\u2019s propensity to confidently make up nonsense when answering questions\u2014a problem called \u201challucinating\u201d that is shared to some extent by all LLMs, as demonstrated by the dangerously wrong answers that Google\u2019s recently AI-imbued Search has been giving. Users may not welcome Siri\u2019s newfound willingness to provide answers if those answers are wrong.\nAs for whether Monday\u2019s reveal will be enough to convince Apple\u2019s users and Wall Street that the iPhone remains both a cutting-edge and reliable device, the proof will be in the hands-on experiences that follow when iOS 18 becomes available for public testing in July, ahead of its full release around September.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Apple can avoid a fine if it can address the concerns by modifying its business terms.\n\"As they stand, we think that these new terms do not allow app developers to communicate freely with their end users, and to conclude contracts with them,\" she told a conference.\nShe said it was up to Apple to decide how to comply with the DMA and not for her to tell the company what to do.\nApple said it had made a number of changes in the past several months to comply with the DMA after getting feedback from app developers and the Commission.\n\"As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission,\" it said in an email.\nThe Commission said under most of the business terms, Apple allows steering only through 'link-outs', meaning that app developers can include a link in their app that redirects the customer to a web page where the customer can conclude a contract.\nIt also criticised the fees charged by Apple for facilitating via the App Store the initial acquisition of a new customer by developers, saying they went beyond what was strictly necessary for such remuneration.\n\"We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,\" Apple said in its email.\nNEW CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe EU executive said it was also opening an investigation into the iPhone maker over its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores and whether these were necessary and proportionate.\nAt issue is its core technology fee, the multi-step user journey to download and install alternative app stores on iPhones and the eligibility requirements for developers to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones.\nApple rolled out the new fees in March in the EU, which include the core technology fee to major app developers even if they do not use any of its payment services, prompting criticism from \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games and others.\nVestager also criticised Apple's announcement last week that it would delay the launch of its AI-powered features of its AI-powered features in the EU which the company blamed on the DMA. Vestager said that it seemed that Apple suggested that its AI integration may be anti-competitive.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n"

        "Title": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Before June 10?",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been all the rage since early last year, with many of the biggest companies in technology staking their claim. For example, a number of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been extremely forthcoming about their plans to profit from the windfall resulting from the rapid adoption of AI, and several of these same stocks have generated market-beating returns this year.\nOne member of the collective that's been curiously left out of the conversation is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker has historically kept its plans and product upgrades close to the vest, including its intentions regarding the deployment of generative AI. This, combined with lackluster iPhone sales, has plagued Apple's share price, which is essentially flat in 2024.\nApple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) is scheduled to kick off on June 10, and speculation is rampant that the company will finally lay out its generative AI strategy. That, in turn, could light a fire under Apple's stagnant share price and set the stage for future gains.\nWith the stage set, should investors buy Apple stock before its highly anticipated event? Let's examine the available evidence.\nApple hasn't had much to say about the topic of generative AI, at least until recently. After remaining largely silent on the topic for nearly a year, CEO Tim Cook has finally begun to shed some light on Apple's aspirations. Earlier this year, Cook said of the company's AI plans, \"We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\" When pressed for additional details, Cook responded, \"Our M.O. [modus operandi], if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work.\"\nCook opened up a little more during Apple's second-quarter earnings call. \"We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.\" Cook went on to highlight the company's \"seamless\" integration of hardware, software, services, and processors while never taking its eye off user privacy.\nHistorically speaking, Apple has announced some of its most groundbreaking product releases and updates during WWDC, so it stands to reason the company would reveal its generative AI objectives at the event.\nWall Street is buzzing about Apple's annual conference, which would mark the perfect venue to introduce developers to the company's AI functionality. This would give them time to create signature generative AI-powered apps before the release of the next iPhone.\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan suggests that the release of AI-enabled phones could spark a multiyear upgrade cycle that's a \"once in a decade type of event.\" He goes on to suggest that with more than 2.2 billion active devices, Apple could drive generative AI into the mainstream. These AI-fueled devices could vastly improve photography, health monitoring, security, and even battery life.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives is even more bullish, raising his price target on Apple stock to $275 while maintaining an outperform (buy) rating on the shares. That represents 45% upside compared to Tuesday's closing price. Ives posits that an \"AI-driven iPhone 16 supercycle [is] now on the horizon.\" The analyst goes on to say that generative AI will represent \"ample monetization opportunities\" for Cook and company. Ives also revealed that recent channel checks suggest the beginning of a long-awaited rebound in iPhone sales in China, one of Apple's biggest markets. Tepid sales in the region have weighed on the stock in recent quarters.\nIt's also worth noting that of the 38 analysts who offered an opinion on Apple stock in May, 84% rated it a buy or strong buy, and not a single one recommended selling. Since Wall Street rarely agrees on anything, it's noteworthy when there's such a solid consensus.\nFor day traders looking to make a quick buck, hopping into and out of stocks around major events in order to catch the rally before selling, Apple might not be the stock for you. Truth be told, we don't know exactly what Apple will announce at WWDC. Furthermore, even if the company does jump feet-first into generative AI, that doesn't mean its efforts will yield immediate results.\nHowever, for investors with an outlook of years rather than weeks or months, there's plenty to like about Apple. The company has a long track record of defying detractors while continuing to build an empire. Market historians will note that Apple has rarely been first to market with anything but frequently releases industry-leading products that stand the test of time. At the same time, services is Apple's fastest-growing segment, driven by its 2.2 billion active devices.\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I'm inclined to believe that Apple stock will perform much better in the second half of 2024 than the first half and will be a market-beating investment over the next five years. That said, if the company's WWDC announcement disappoints, it could be a rough ride over the short term.\nFinally, there's the matter of Apple's valuation. At 29 times trailing-12-month earnings, the stock is only slightly more expensive than the multiple of 27 for the S&P 500. Furthermore, over the past five years, Apple stock has soared 327% (as of this writing), more than three times the 88% gains produced by the broad index. This helps illustrate why Apple is deserving of a premium.\nFor investors looking beyond June, I believe Apple's long track record of success speaks volumes about the company and its future prospects. That's why investors should simply buy Apple for the long runway ahead.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

They sued Apple in March, alleging that it used illegal tactics to hold on to a monopoly in the smartphone market.\nApple is fighting the US lawsuit, and on Monday it said in a statement that it has made a number of changes to comply with the new EU law and \"we are confident out plan complies with the law.\"\nInvestors shrugged off the news, sending Apple\u2019s stock up more than 1%.\nThe law that the EU claims Apple violated went into effect in March. It targets six Big Tech companies that the EU considers to be \"gatekeepers\" \u2014 Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), ByteDance, Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) \u2014 and imposes more restrictive rules around competition.\nThe law\u2019s purpose is to keep the most dominant tech companies from blocking smaller rivals from entering certain markets.\nApple is the first tech giant to receive a claim from the EC alleging that it breached the DMA.\nThe DMA allows Apple to charge developers a fee for new customers who sign up through the App Store.\nHowever, the law prevents Apple from blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\nAnd that\u2019s what regulators said Apple did.\n\"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers, and allow them to make purchases,\" the commission said in an announcement explaining its findings.\nApple said in a statement it estimates more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms it created.\n\"All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilize the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate.\"\nViolations of the DMA carry hefty consequences, permitting fines up to 10% of a company\u2019s global annual revenue. In Apple\u2019s case, global revenues reached $383 billion in 2023.\nApple doesn\u2019t segregate its App Store revenue in its financial filings. However, its growing services category, which includes the store\u2019s revenue, reached $85 billion that same year.\nThe EC\u2019s announcement significantly broadened the financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators.\nThe commission said it had undertaken another probe to determine if Apple\u2019s charge, which assesses developers 0.50 euros for app downloads exceeding 1 million, is in breach of the DMA.\nAnd earlier this year, the EC revealed a fine against Apple for another lawsuit it brought on antitrust grounds.\nThe case, which was originated by Spotify (SPOT), targeted Apple\u2019s rules that precluded streaming music apps from directing their users to pay for content outside the app store.\nThe EC fined Apple $1.95 billion for the practice.

But by leaning more heavily into App Store commissions and subscriptions, Apple draws more scrutiny to its \u201cwalled garden\u201d business approach.\nIn preliminary findings, regulators in Brussels contended that Apple violated the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 designed to address anticompetitive behavior. The EU alleges Apple illegally blocked software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the App Store. The charges are the first to be brought under the European law, giving Apple the unlucky designation of being the first US tech giant to come in its crosshairs.\nApple insists that it is in compliance with the law, pointing to changes it has made in recent months and the ability of developers to steer their users to the web to complete purchases. The company will have a chance to formally respond, and the EU will come to a final decision early next year. European regulators are also probing the business practices of Meta and Google to verify their compliance with the law.\nApple\u2019s charges in Europe come as legal troubles ratchet up at home. Apple faces antitrust charges from the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general who have alleged that the iPhone maker wielded illegal monopoly tactics in the smartphone market.\nFrom Wall Street\u2019s point of view, the multiheaded threat seems far off. Apple has only just arrived to the AI party, and its bullish analysts see AI monetization as the next lucrative frontier.\nThe ultimate cost of regulatory compliance might mean a splintered tech landscape with more restrictive rules for some markets. But the Apple ecosystem remains unrivaled.\nAnd if AI-focused apps fall into place like the prior generation\u2019s, even a more competition-friendly form of gatekeeping will be enough to keep Apple on top.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors have been cheering lately as the iPhone maker's stock soared from roughly $197 on June 7 to more than $220 on June 12. It has retreated since, closing Tuesday at just over $214 a share -- but one Wall Street analyst now says it's a buy.\nOn Friday, Germany's Erste Group Bank upgraded Apple stock from neutral to buy.\nAs StreetInsider reports, Erste analyst Hans Engel thinks the company's popularity with teens, and their intense loyalty to the brand -- with 90% of U.S. teenagers preferring iPhones to the alternatives -- are competitive advantages for Apple. The analyst also likes the tech titan's record of innovation, developing feature-rich, high-end devices and ever-faster chips for its Mac computers to keep its customers coming back for more.\nIn this regard, Engel sees Apple's move to integrate\u00a0ChatGPT's artificial intelligence into the iPhone as a key development that \"will lead to rising software and hardware sales\" for the company.\nHere's another reason to like the news: According to a Bloomberg report out last week, the total cost to Apple of adding ChatGPT to its iPhones is zero dollars, zero cents.\nNeither Apple nor OpenAI have commented publicly on the financial terms of their partnership. But citing \"people briefed on the matter,\" Bloomberg reported that Apple isn't paying OpenAI for ChatGPT. Instead, Apple has convinced OpenAI that \"pushing OpenAI's brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments.\"\nFor OpenAI this seems like bad news: No big cash influx from Apple will be forthcoming. If it wants to make money, it will have to do so by convincing iPhone users to upgrade to paid versions of ChatGPT. Meanwhile, Apple gets access to the world's leading AI system for free.\nThat said, Apple stock at 33 times trailing earnings still isn't cheap. It will need to transform free ChatGPT into stronger earnings growth to justify this price.

Apple revealed some of the features at its annual developer conference this week and released more details Tuesday.\nThe biggest change for consumers will be ability for banks to offer multiple forms of financing to customers within Apple Pay, as well as the ability pay with rewards points or programs through an iPhone or other Apple device. iPhone users currently can use credit or debit cards to fund Apple Pay purchases.\nApple will now give banks the ability to offer other forms of financing through the same credit cards, like buy now, pay later, monthly installment plans, or the use of reward points.\nBuy now, pay later company Affirm will be integrated into Apple Pay, allowing customers to apply for an account with Affirm inside of Apple Pay. Shares of Affirm rose nearly 5% Tuesday on the news. Apple said that its own buy now, pay later service, known as Apple Pay Later, is not going anywhere and the other major buy now, pay later companies like Klarna will also be able to integrate into Apple Wallet.\nApple Pay has become a significant force in mobile and digital payments since it was rolled out nearly a decade ago, along with Apple Wallet.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), bears responsibility for \"major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions\" made by the company, according to financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWith that in mind, Berkshire sold 116 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in the March quarter, reducing its stake by 13%. Apple still accounts for 40% of its $336 billion portfolio, but the company has now trimmed the position in two consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Buffett purchased another mega-cap stock he believes will outperform the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index.\nRead on to learn more.\nApple benefits from brand authority and pricing power. Its ecosystem of appealing hardware, proprietary software, and integrated services creates a user experience for which people will pay a premium. Indeed, 80% of iPhones are priced above $800, while just 22% of Samsung (Android) smartphones are in the same range, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC).\nApple has a particularly strong presence in the smartphone market. The iPhone accounted for 20% of smartphone shipments by volume last year, up from 14% in 2019, according to IDC. But Apple also has a strong presence in the tablet, personal computer, and smartwatch markets, among other consumer electronics verticals. In total, its installed base exceeds 2.2 billion active devices.\nApple monetizes its installed base with adjacent services. That includes fees for iCloud storage, App Store downloads, and subscription products like Apple TV+, as well as advertising and financial services like Apple Pay. Importantly, Apple's greatest growth prospects lie in services, because services revenue is growing more quickly than hardware revenue and services earn higher margins than hardware.\nApple reported disappointing financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 30). Revenue fell 4% to $90.8 billion due to a 10% decline in iPhone sales offset by a 14% increase in services sales. Meanwhile, GAAP net income dropped 2% to $23.6 billion, though the company managed to grow earnings per share with stock buybacks.\nThe problem with Apple is valuation. Wall Street expects earnings per share to grow at 10.6% annually over the next three to five years. If that number is divided into its current price-to-earnings ratio of 33.1, the result is a high price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 3.1. That is a significant premium to the three-year average of 2.4, which may explain why Buffett trimmed Berkshire's stake.\nThe mega-cap stock Buffett bought during the first quarter was none other than Berkshire Hathaway. Specifically, he spent $2.6 billion on share buybacks during Q1 2024, building on $9.2 billion in share buybacks in 2023. Buffett has now repurchased Berkshire stock in every quarter since Q4 2018, which tallies up to 22 consecutive quarters.\nThat is consequential because the repurchase agreement stipulates that Buffett can only buy Berkshire stock when he \"believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire's intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\" In other words, Buffett believes the stock has consistently traded at a discount to its true value for several years.\nBerkshire is a compelling investment for three reasons. First, its insurance subsidiaries generate cash in the form of premiums, and Buffett has historically earned good returns by investing that capital. Berkshire's book value per share increased at 11.1% annually over the last decade, while the S&P 500 returned 10.9% annually during the same period. Changes in book value per share are a good proxy for changes in intrinsic value, so the implication is that Berkshire gained value more quickly than the S&P 500 over the last decade.\nSecond, Berkshire owns dozens of subsidiaries that operate across a diverse range of industries, including insurance, freight rail transportation, energy, retail, and utilities. Many of those wholly owned businesses provide goods and services that are essential in any economic environment, such that Berkshire has historically outperformed the S&P 500 during bear markets, as shown in the chart below.\nBear Market Start Date\nS&P 500 Maximum Decline\nBerkshire Hathaway Maximum Decline\nMarch 2000\n(49%)\n(24%)\nOctober 2007\n(57%)\n(54%)\nFebruary 2020\n(34%)\n(30%)\nJanuary 2022\n(25%)\n(27%)\nAverage\n(41%)\n(34%)\nData source: Yardeni Research, Ycharts.\nThird, Warren Buffett has great confidence in Berkshire. \"[W]ith our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,\" he wrote in his latest shareholder letter. The S&P 500 is synonymous with the U.S. stock market and, therefore, a benchmark for the average American corporation. So Buffett is saying Berkshire should safely outpace the S&P 500 over the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has experienced many struggles since its 1980 IPO. After its board fired Steve Jobs in 1985, the company spent years in the wilderness. It suspended its dividend payout in 1996, and was close to bankruptcy when it brought Jobs back in 1997.\nShortly after that, Apple stock began a run that made it one of the most successful stocks in history, illustrating how innovation can dramatically improve a company's fortunes.\nIf one had bought $1,000 in Apple stock when Jobs returned in February 1997 and held on until today, that position would be worth around $1.8 million. That figure assumes this hypothetical investor would have reinvested their income from the dividend, which Apple reinstated in 2012.\nJobs' first major move after returning was to integrate the Mac ecosystem with the broader tech world, convincing Microsoft to invest $150 million in Apple and develop and support a Mac-compatible version of its popular Office software.\nHe also set to build an Apple ecosystem, revamping the Macintosh, launching the iMac in 1998, and following up with a new MacOS in 2001. The company gained additional traction by launching the iPod music player in 2001, and opening Apple Stores and the iTunes Store soon after.\nHowever, the innovation that truly transformed Apple was the iPhone, which it launched in 2007. It pioneered the modern smartphone industry, and eventually eliminated many people's need to own a PC. So successful was the iPhone that it drives the majority of Apple's revenue to this day.\nApple's pace of innovation slowed with the passing of Jobs in 2011. Now, it more directly competes with devices and apps using Alphabet's Android operating system and with most of its mega-tech competitors in the artificial intelligence field.\nNonetheless, its continued innovations have at times made it the world's largest company by market cap, and positioned it in the top three today. Thanks to products such as the iPhone and its extensive ecosystem, Apple's stock price should continue to grow.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has rallied roughly 22% over the last three months thanks to strong earnings and excitement surrounding artificial intelligence initiatives. The company's most recent annual DEF14A filing, which shows how many shares of stock large investors own, shows that CEO Tim Cook's stock position is worth more than $690 million. But at least one other person owns far more Apple stock.\nAs of Apple's most recent public filing, board chairman Ari Levinson owned more than 4.59 million shares of the company's stock. This position means that he holds more shares of Apple stock directly than any other individually listed shareholder. For comparison, Tim Cook owned a little over 3.28 million shares of his company's stock per the most recent disclosure.\nBut another high-profile money man may have an even bigger Apple stake. When Apple published its DEF14A showing institutional ownership as of Jan. 31, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) and its CEO Warren Buffett owned 915.6 million shares of the company's stock. Even after a subsequent disclosure filing from Berkshire showed that it sold roughly 116 million Apple shares in this year's first quarter, Buffett's company still held roughly 790 million shares of the iPhone maker's stock.\nBerkshire and Buffett's holdings are combined in Apple's filings, and Buffett's individual stock ownership is not detailed in Berkshire's disclosures. Because of this, it's not clear how much the investment conglomerate's CEO owns directly. But is clear that his indirect investment in Apple is massive.

No construction has begun.\nSite plans filed last summer showed the campus would include three office buildings, three accessory buildings and a parking garage \u2014totaling nearly 900,000 square feet on either side of N.C. 540.\nThe company will only benefit from North Carolina\u2019s job development investment grant \u2014 worth up to $845 million in payroll tax benefits through the year 2061 \u2014 if it reaches certain annual hiring and investment targets.\nWhile the company has more than six years to complete its campus, its hiring clock began last year with an obligation to have added a minimum of 126 local workers. This jobs target increases to 378 total positions by the end of 2024 and increases up to 2,700 jobs in 2032.\nFor now, Apple leases office space at the MetLife campus in Cary. The California-based tech giant has also purchased a four-story, 139,000-square-foot building in Durham, near the RDU airport, according to multiple sources familiar with that site.\nThe Triangle Business Journal first reported on Apple\u2019s planned pause Monday.\nApple said it would not expect to receive taxpayer benefits while its agreement is delayed, but it is not yet clear what actions North Carolina could take at this time to adjust the company\u2019s incentive deal timeline.\nIn a statement Monday, Gov. Roy Cooper expressed confidence in Apple\u2019s future in the Triangle.\n\u201cI have spoken with officials at Apple, and they emphasized their commitment to build this transformative campus here in North Carolina,\u201d Cooper said.\nEnjoy Triangle tech news?

        "Text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nNow that Cupertino has unveiled its AI plans, the relationship between frenemies Apple and Google just got more complicated.\nThat\u2019s because the sometimes-gadget rivals work as partners when it comes to search and online advertising. But the tie-up, which has featured heavily in a landmark antitrust lawsuit against Google\u2019s dominance in the search engine market, will come under new strain as AI changes how people seek out information online.\nFor more than two decades, Apple has fixed Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser. Apple steers the traffic of its huge user base into Google\u2019s search business. And in exchange for the default privilege, Google pays the iPhone maker around $18 billion a year.\nBut Apple, to the delight of investors, has another deal going. Enter Sam Altman.\nApple is partnering with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the iPhone. It\u2019s part of a bold effort to catch up to Big Tech rivals that have gone all-in on AI. Later this year, iPhone users will get free access to the chatbot, which will mesh with Siri and other apps, giving people access to a repository of knowledge and granting OpenAI a ticket to mainstreaming AI technology.\nApple's iPhones infused with increasingly capable versions of ChatGPT would lessen the need to use Google search. If users in significant numbers start interacting with the web primarily through Siri instead of a search bar, even the heavy influence of default status might mean very little for the future of search traffic.\nApple\u2019s alliance with OpenAI comes at a pivotal moment for Google\u2019s own AI ventures.\nThe search giant recently released its new feature, AI Overviews, which gives users pithy answers to their search queries without having to click around the web. But Overviews, along with a previous image generation tool, was met with near-instant criticism as users discovered the AI features were churning out absurd or incorrect information.\nThe troubled debuts shaped a pattern of bungled releases. They\u2019ve fed a narrative that Google\u2019s rush to plant its AI flag reflected mismanagement and strategic weakness. Deeper issues are also at play.\nIf chatbots and other software powered by large language models (LLMs) are as transformational as tech executives claim they are, the business of search is poised for major disruption.\nEvery new deal OpenAI inks with media and technology companies can be seen as an attempt to strengthen an alternative to search, siphoning attention away from Google\u2019s empire.\nApple can still team up with Google, of course, perhaps eventually pulling in Gemini, Google\u2019s set of generative AI models, even as it continues to develop in-house AI technology.\nApple\u2019s OpenAI collaboration doesn\u2019t eclipse its long union with Google. But it adds a wrinkle to the relationship. In this early stage of a new tech paradigm, a fresh set of defaults is up for grabs.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": "  Momo Tabari ",
        "Text": "Apple announced in a statement to 9to5Mac on Monday that it is discontinuing its relatively new Apple Pay Later service, which is shocking as it hasn't been available for a year.\nThe company introduced Apple Pay Later to the world back in March 2023, created with \"users' financial health in mind.\" The service offered loans anywhere from $50 to $1,000 that were paid with four payments over the course of six weeks. The service came with no interest and no fees, which made it a convenient and easy prospect when checking out a purchase.\nApple Pay Later was made publicly available to all users in October 2023, but after eight months, the service was shut down as of Monday, according to Apple's support website.\nWhile this may sound worrying, you don't need to fear: Users who have loans in progress will be able to continue paying those loans through Apple Wallet as they could before. The only difference now is that no new loans can be made.\nHowever, WWDC 2024 brought many new announcements, and something coming through Apple Wallet could be a worthy substitution for Apple Pay Later.\nAs revealed during WWDC 2024, Apple Wallet will let users access third-party loan offerings from \"eligible\" credit or debit cards or through Affirm if they're in the United States. These features are coming to Apple Wallet this fall.\nAs any company is keen to do after shutting down a convenient service, Apple's statement to 9to5Mac mentions what the company is doing with Apple Wallet to compensate for the removal of Apple Pay Later:\n\"With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.\"\nHere are the eligible banks that are compatible with Apple Wallet loans:\nUnited States: Citi, Synchrony, Fiserv\nUnited Kingdom: HSBC, Monzo\nAustralia: ANZ\nSpain: CaixaBank\nWhile this is what's available now, more could be introduced into Apple Wallet in the future.\nAlthough the inclusion of these features will be convenient for many, Apple Wallet's new compatibility with loans from third-party bankers cannot fill the gap that Apple Pay Later left with its removal. Apple Pay Later offered zero interest and zero fees, was available directly through Apple Wallet, and was backed by Apple itself.\nThere's heightened convenience to being able to purchase something in smaller installments through Apple Wallet. While it was only available to those in the United States, those who used it will feel its absence, and its sudden removal likely signals Apple pulling away from that type of finance.\nApple Pay Later was a bold move from Apple, revealing that it would be occupying a space it hadn't before. Offering its own financial loan service was unprecedented and signaled a potential new avenue for the company to expand its reach, but its discontinuation only after eight months gives the opposite impression.\nNot only is it discontinued, but Apple Wallet is going all-in on third-party inclusion and bringing it to more than just the United States. It's uncertain if we'll see the company return to its own in-house financial services after such a quick pullaway, but we cannot imagine that it'll happen anytime soon.\nApple is gearing up for M4 Mac launch \u2014 here\u2019s a look at the release window and all the new chips\nApple's slow rollout of Apple Intelligence features isn't vaporware, it'll just feel like it\nApple is making the iPhone, MacBook and Watch thinner, but what's the catch?\n"

It announced the new tech at WWDC 2024.\nApple Intelligence will have an understanding of who you're talking with in a messaging conversation, so if you want to personalize that chat with a custom AI image, you can create one on the fly.\nFor example, Apple showed off making an AI Bitmoji of a friend celebrating their birthday with an image that included cake, balloons and flowers. Another showed a mom dressed in a superhero cape to show off her kid's respect for her abilities.\nThe feature will support just three illustrative styles at launch: sketch, illustration and animation.\nIt's reminiscent of something a group of ex-Snap researchers were working on with their startup Easel, which was something of a next-generation Bitmoji. \nThe image-generation capabilities will also work across other apps like Notes, Freeform, Keynote and Pages, Apple says.\nLater in the keynote, Apple more formally announced Genmoji, a feature that lets you create AI emoji-like images of anyone from your Photos library or just custom emoji. The Genmoji can be used as a sticker for reacting to messages with a Tapback or inline with your messages, Apple said.\nAnother new feature, Image Playground \u2014 also available as a stand-alone app and API for developers \u2014 will allow users to create images using concepts like themes, costumes, accessories, places and more. You select the times you want to include and, moments later, the Apple Intelligence-powered feature will create a preview of your image.\nThere's no need to engineer the perfect prompt, the company notes.\nYou can swipe through the image previews and create more images by selecting different styles, like sketch, animation, or illustration, or switch back. Apple Intelligence will also suggest concepts related to your messages conversation, but all this takes place on the device, according to Apple.\nIn addition to generating images, Apple Intelligence will work across apps to allow for other functionality, like the ability to ask it to pull up the files you interacted with last week or the photos of a specific person. Or you may want to ask it to play the podcast someone recommended to you previously.\nIts understanding of apps and the actions included will make the feature more powerful as it will understand things like the details of your Calendar appointments alongside traffic information from Maps and more, providing a more personal context to your interactions.\nAlso at WWDC 2024, Apple announced updates to Siri and introduced macOS Sequoia.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EYoV1kZWkThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-debuts-ai-generated-bitmoji/\n"

As of 1:53 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 6.2%.\nThe catalyst that sent the iPhone maker higher was the company's big artificial intelligence (AI) reveal to kick off Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).\nInvestors have been waiting since early last year for insight into Apple's plans to join the AI revolution. At the WWDC keynote yesterday, CEO Tim Cook finally detailed the company's plans, and Wall Street's response was extremely bullish.\nThe biggest revelation was the debut of Apple Intelligence, which will provide on-device generative AI processing across the company's entire product line while also maintaining Apple's famous emphasis on security.\nSiri will get a long-awaited AI upgrade and have a greater ability to interact with other iPhone apps. ChatGPT will also be integrated into the iPhone, giving users the option to engage the chatbot for specific topics. Apple also unveiled a host of other AI-powered features that will debut with iOS 18, which will be released this fall.\nMany investors had taken a \"wait and see\" approach with Apple, worried about waning sales of its flagship iPhone. However, in the wake of the company's presentation, Wall Street has turned decidedly bullish.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives expressed the prevailing sentiment, suggesting the addition of these new tools to the iPhone will spark \"an AI-driven iPhone upgrade cycle starting with iPhone 16.\" The analyst also suggested AI will add $30 to $40 per share to Apple's growth story.\nEven as big tech has staged a significant rally over the past year, Apple's stock has been the outlier, up just 7%, compared to 25% gains for the S&P 500. A laundry list of AI-powered features will likely mark the dawn of the next upgrade cycle, boosting the company's results and putting Apple back in investors' good graces.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- When a 23-year-old Sam Altman took the stage at Apple Inc.\u2019s annual developer conference in 2008, he gushed about being able to use the company\u2019s new App Store to promote his software, a friend-locating service called Loopt. \u201cWe think this is a new era of mobile, and we\u2019re thrilled to be part of it,\u201d Altman said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nReal Estate Investors Are Wiped Out in Bets Fueled by Wall Street Loans\nBehind \u2018Suicide Squad,\u2019 the Year\u2019s Biggest Video-Game Flop\nVietnam Tycoon Sentenced to Death Faces New Charges: Media\nPutin\u2019s Wartime Central Banker Tells Him What He Doesn\u2019t Want to Hear\nGameStop Slumps on Share Sale Plan Hours Before Gill Stream\nNow, 16 years later, Apple is calling upon the entrepreneur again \u2014 but with a twist. This time, the company needs his help as much as he needs Apple.\nAltman currently runs OpenAI, the leading startup in generative artificial intelligence. And Apple, racing to catch up in that area, has forged a partnership to integrate OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT into the iPhone\u2019s operating system. Though the controversial Altman is unlikely to take the stage at the event, the agreement will be a key focus of Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference next week \u2014 and it shows just how much the power in Silicon Valley has shifted over the past few years.\nThe deal gives OpenAI access to hundreds of millions of Apple users, including ones that might have been hesitant to try ChatGPT otherwise. For Apple, the arrangement brings the company the hottest technology of the AI era \u2014 a chatbot with eerily powerful abilities \u2014 that it can pair with its own services.\nApple has been developing a host of AI features, including ones that run on its devices and others that require cloud computing. It\u2019s also infusing its Siri digital assistant with AI. But the company\u2019s own chatbot isn\u2019t yet up to snuff.\nThe OpenAI partnership is likely a \u201cshort- to medium-term relationship\u201d for Apple, said Dag Kittlaus, a tech veteran who co-founded and ran the Siri business before it was acquired by Apple. \u201cBut you can bet that they will be working hard building out their own competencies here.\u201d\nThe WWDC keynote address, delivered by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook on June 10, is seen as Apple\u2019s biggest sales pitch in years. The company has to convince consumers, developers and investors that it can thrive in the AI era. And there\u2019s added pressure because Apple\u2019s existing business is stagnant, with revenue declining in five of the past six quarters.\nThe two companies haven\u2019t disclosed the deal publicly yet, and terms of the arrangement aren\u2019t clear. Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment, as did San Francisco-based OpenAI.\nApple once had a head start in AI services. It released the Siri digital assistant in 2011, beating Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Alexa and the Google Assistant to the market. But it soon fell behind rivals, and that was before a seismic shift in 2022 when ChatGPT debuted.\nThe introduction of OpenAI\u2019s chatbot in November of that year captured the imagination of consumers and sent tech giants scrambling to develop their own AI services. Apple\u2019s biggest peers have all made headway since then. Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot is vying with ChatGPT for supremacy in the nascent market. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI\u2019s biggest backer, has begun weaving its AI-assisted Copilot into software. And Amazon.com Inc. has demonstrated an AI-enhanced version of Alexa.\nIn contrast, Apple kept its AI ambitions quiet until now. Cook said last year that the company would tread carefully in the new space and only add AI technology on a \u201cvery thoughtful basis.\u201d More recently, he\u2019s argued that Apple will have an edge in AI because of its \u201cunique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration.\u201d\nBehind the scenes, Apple employees have been working furiously to back up that promise. Around the time of the ChatGPT launch, small teams within the company\u2019s AI and software engineering divisions began working on a competitor to ChatGPT, using a framework dubbed Ajax.\nSoftware chief Craig Federighi pushed managers to pack the latest version of the iPhone and iPad operating system \u2014 known internally as \u201cCrystal\u201d \u2014 with as much AI as possible. Eddy Cue\u2019s services division got to work on new data center infrastructure for powering online AI services. Staffers also began investigating how AI could come to Apple Music and the company\u2019s office-productivity apps.\nApple found that its AI is capable enough to power features like voice memo transcriptions and photo editing, as well as new search capabilities in the Safari web browser and auto replies in apps like Messages. But it determined early on that OpenAI and Google were far ahead in chatbots and on-the-fly assistance.\nThat put Apple in a difficult spot. The company\u2019s own technology wasn\u2019t ready, and executives were concerned about reputational damage from a rogue chatbot. Some people within Apple even have a philosophical aversion to having a chatbot at all, people familiar with the situation have said.\nBut it was clear by then that consumers would expect Apple to offer such a service, and that set the company on the path to its deal with OpenAI. Several months ago, the company began meeting with the startup \u2014 along with Google and other chatbot providers \u2014 about integrating the technology into its iOS software.\nBy outsourcing the chatbot function, Apple can distance itself from the technology itself, including its occasional inaccuracies and hallucinations, the people said. But it also links Apple to a startup beset by upheaval and controversy. Altman, now 39, was briefly ousted last year for reasons that remain murky, and he recently drew the ire of movie star Scarlett Johansson for a soundalike AI voice.\nThough Apple remains in talks with Google about using Gemini in its devices, the iPhone maker reached an agreement with OpenAI first. In the end, Apple may offer a number of third-party chatbots, but it\u2019s negotiating the deals on a case-by-case basis, according to the people with knowledge of the situation.\nApple picked OpenAI as its inaugural AI partner for a few reasons, one of the people said. It got better business terms than Google was offering, and Apple believes that OpenAI\u2019s technology is the best available on the market. Integrating Google AI into the iPhone also might have given the impression that Apple\u2019s biggest technology rival had beat it in a vital new area.\nOpenAI, meanwhile, will get the gigantic exposure that comes with being deeply integrated into some of the world\u2019s best-selling smartphones and tablets. Still, Apple\u2019s involvement may bring new scrutiny to the safety and privacy concerns swirling around ChatGPT. Depending on how deeply Apple plans to integrate the chatbot with its software, it also could mean that OpenAI has access to personal information, which could unnerve some users.\nBut Apple is expected to offer its new AI features as an opt-in service, according to the people familiar with the matter. So wary customers could easily steer clear of them if they\u2019d prefer.\nRegardless, the OpenAI agreement is likely a stopgap measure. Apple has a long history of eventually bringing outside technology in-house, such as when it replaced Intel Corp. chips with its own silicon.\nApple also is looking beyond chatbots. It aims to use large language models \u2014 a key technology behind generative AI \u2014 to help power a pair of robotic devices that it is secretly developing, the people said.\nThat includes a table-top robotic arm with a large, iPad-like display. The company also has been working on a mobile robot that can follow users around and handle chores on their behalf. And it\u2019s looking to equip its AirPods with cameras and AI features.\nMore immediately, there\u2019s the opportunity for Siri to finally live up to its potential, Kittlaus said. That could bring some vindication to a company that hatched the dream of a smart personal assistant under co-founder Steve Jobs.\n\u201cThere are no longer any technical constraints to realizing the original Siri vision,\u201d Kittlaus said.\n--With assistance from Rachel Metz and Shirin Ghaffary.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nSam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "Title": "Analyst Sees Apple App Store Revenue Up Double Digits So Far This Quarter. Is the Stock Poised to Rally?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has had some issues recently, as evidenced by its most recent quarterly results. The company saw its total revenue fall 4% as iPhone sales sank 10%.\nHowever, one bright spot for the company has been its service revenue, which includes its App Store and Apple TV. Service revenue rose 14% last quarter and that momentum appears to be continuing with one Wall Street analyst recently saying the company's App Store revenue was tracking up double digits so far this quarter.\nLet's take a closer look at the analyst's comments and what continued strength with its App Store could mean for Apple's stock moving forward.\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan recently put out a note using data from market intelligence company Sensor Tower that showed through the first 66 days of the company's fiscal third quarter, App Store revenue was up 11% to $5.4 billion. Growth in productivity apps led the way, with the segment seeing 36% year-over-year growth. Revenue from gaming, its largest app segment, was up 6%.\nImportantly, Mohan noted that European Union data showed that revenue in the region has increased by 25% over the past 90 days, while downloads were up 3%. This is important information as the European Union (EU) forced Apple to open up its system to third-party app stores and browsers as part of its Digital Markets Act. Mohan noted so far there has been very little change in consumer behavior toward Apple's App Store despite this new law.\nThis in and of itself is good news. However, if this behavior is indicative of consumers around the globe, especially in the U.S., it would also remove a potential risk that Apple is facing. The possibility of the U.S. forcing Apple to make similar changes has been a risk, but if consumers aren't going to change their habits even when other app stores and browsers are allowed on Apple's platform, then the risk becomes greatly diminished.\nThe Sensor Tower data also revealed that May was a stronger month than April, with May App Store revenue up 12%, including 10% growth in China. China was led by a 20% jump in entertainment app revenue.\nSpeaking of China, in a separate report, Citibank analyst Atif Malik recently released a note saying that third-party data show iPhone demand in China was stabilizing, which correlates with its own Asia supply chain checks. Malik said that sale discounts in China ahead of the country's 618 shopping holiday have helped boost sales. This followed news that iPhone sales in China surged 52% in April.\nBoth the App Store and China data points are important for Apple. App Store and service revenue have been a bright spot for the company and this segment comes with a much higher gross margin than its product sales. In the first quarter, service gross margin was 74.6%, while product gross margin was 36.6%. That means service revenue is dropping to the bottom line as profits much more than product sales. This helped Apple report an increase in profits through the first half of its fiscal year even though its revenue ticked down slightly.\nMeanwhile, China has been a tough market for Apple recently, so seeing stabilization is a good sign.\nApple hit a bit of a rough patch recently, but there appear to be solid signs that the worst is now behind the company. Meanwhile, the company could be in store for a hardware upgrade cycle in the coming years as consumers look to upgrade their smartphones and computers to run the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Apple hasn't been at the forefront of AI, but it tends not to rush into new technology, instead preferring to get it right first. With its integrated ecosystem, I would expect when the company introduces more AI intensive features, they will run smoothly.\nTrading at a 30 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, Apple stock is not in the bargain bin given where its growth has recently been.\nWith App Store risks diminishing, China stabilizing, and a potential boost from AI ahead of it, now looks like a good time to get into Apple's stock, which has been a laggard compared to many other large-cap tech stocks over the past year. I would expect growth to start to pick up next fiscal year and for the stock to be a solid winner over the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The European Commission (EC) has delivered a preliminary assessment to Apple, suggesting that the US tech giant's App Store policies may violate the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) by restricting app developers from directing consumers to alternative purchasing options.\nUnder the DMA, app developers should have the ability to inform and direct customers to more cost-effective purchasing avenues outside of the App Store without incurring costs.\nHowever, the commission's initial findings indicate that Apple's current business terms do not grant developers this freedom.\nApple is among six gatekeepers - the others being Alphabet, Amazon, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft, designated by the EC under the DMA.\nThe EC has taken issue with Apple's fee structure, which includes charges for digital goods or services purchased within seven days following a customer's use of a link-out from the app. These fees are considered excessive.\nApple now has the opportunity to respond to the commission's preliminary conclusions and defend its practices.\nShould the EC ultimately uphold its initial views, it would mean that none of Apple's business terms align with Article 5(4) of the DMA.\nA decision on non-compliance could be reached within 12 months from the commencement of the proceedings on 25 March 2024.\nThe commission has launched a third investigation into Apple's new contractual terms for developers, which are required to access features made possible by the DMA.\nThe investigation will scrutinise whether these new terms, including the core technology fee and the process for downloading and installing alternative app stores or apps on iPhones and the eligibility criteria for developers, adhere to the DMA's necessity and proportionality standards.\nEC executive vice-president-in-charge for competition policy Margrethe Vestager said: \u201cToday is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA: we have sent preliminary findings to Apple.\u201d\n\u201cWe will investigate to ensure Apple does not undermine these efforts.\u201d\nOther aspects related to Apple's validation processes for apps and alternative app stores intended for sideloading will continue to be investigated.\n\"EC accuses Apple App Store policies of violating DMA rules\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock chart is a thing of beauty. Shares of this tech heavyweight are up 54% in the past three years. That gain easily outpaces the 22% rise of the Nasdaq Composite index.\nAs this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock currently trades near its all-time high, investors might be considering adding the business to their portfolios. So it's important to ask, where will Apple be in three years?\nApple's monster success can largely be attributed to the popularity of the iPhone, which bucks the typical short lifespan and deflationary trend of consumer electronics. A whopping 17 years after its introduction, this single product still represents about half of the company's total revenue.\nThe management team is still focused on growing iPhone sales, with a new update slated to launch later this year. Apple has also finally opened retail stores in India, hoping to further tap the world's most populated country.\nIn 2027, I believe there's a very good probability that this business will still depend on the iPhone for its financial success. Yes, Apple sells other well-known products, like the Watch, AirPods, MacBook, and iPad. But its industry-leading smartphone still reigns supreme.\nInvestors should understand the downside of this, though. The iPhone is a mature product, as there are about 1.4 billion of these devices that are active across the world. So, it will become harder to drive outsize revenue gains.\nAt a $3 trillion market cap and with trailing-12-month revenue of $382 billion, Apple will probably need to introduce a new game-changing product to drive faster revenue growth. There is no reason for investors to be optimistic about this happening.\nIn addition to its successful hardware devices, Apple has done a fantastic job at boosting its services division. In the latest quarter (the fiscal second quarter of 2024 ended March 30), this segment grew sales 14% year over year to $24 billion, accounting for 26% of the company's total. Three years ago in Q2 2021, services only represented 19% of overall sales.\nI see no reason to believe that this trend won't continue over the next three years and beyond. For Apple shareholders, that's an encouraging sign. Services carry a stellar gross margin of 75%, well above the 37% gross margin of products. As more sales are derived from services, perhaps Apple's bottom line can expand even faster than the top line.\nApple's services include popular offerings like Music, Pay, and TV+. Going forward, the little-known advertising operations could become more important. Apple sells digital ads across its properties, like in the App Store and in the News app, for example. Despite being relatively new to the industry, the business is expected to bring in $10 billion in ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer. \nThanks to Apple's incredible run in recent years, the stock is very expensive right now, in my opinion. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.9, which is a 40% premium to their trailing-10-year average. The takeaway is that the market remains extremely optimistic about the company's prospects.\nBut given that Apple is likely to register slower revenue growth in the years ahead, particularly as a result of its massive scale and the maturity of the iPhone, I don't think the current valuation presents investors with a good buying opportunity. The higher valuation creates a scenario where the chance of earning market-beating investment returns over the next three years is low. \nThere's no denying that Apple is one of the world's most successful enterprises. But that doesn't automatically make it a great investment opportunity. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock underperforms the Nasdaq Composite over the next three years.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

As of 1:44 p.m. ET today, the stock was still up 4.9%.\nWall Street continues to weigh in on the iPhone maker's big artificial intelligence (AI) reveal as a part of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\nApple's announcement about its plans for generative AI has been well received by investors, driving the stock higher on Tuesday. As Wall Street continued to digest the news, analysts have been weighing in on what it means for the company and its shareholders. After several upgrades and a number of price-target increases yesterday, the bullish commentary continued today.\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan joined the chorus, suggesting that Apple's installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices provides insight into future demand. The analyst suggests that the debut of Apple Intelligence -- the company's suite of AI-powered features and applications -- will be the catalyst that sparks the next big upgrade cycle.\nMohan sees the replacement cycle for Apple products shrinking as its AI-related improvements give consumers a reason to replace their existing devices. and he believes Wall Street's current outlook is far too low.\nI think he is on the right track. Estimates suggest that there are roughly 1.5 billion iPhones currently in use, and about 270 million of them haven't been upgraded in four years, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.\nThe advent of Apple Intelligence and the buildout of generative AI-powered apps will likely inspire users to upgrade to the iPhone 16, which is expected to debut in the fall. This could lead to a so-called supercycle, with many iPhone owners trading up to the newest device.\nSome investors saw the economic challenges as a reason to abandon Apple stock, but the company has a long track record of defying detractors. The stock currently trades at 33 times earnings, which is a slight premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. But over the past decade, Apple stock has gained 823%, more than four times the 180% gains of the S&P -- which illustrates why it deserves a premium.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:\nRosenblatt upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $260, up from $196. Based on the firm's recent U.S. survey, Rosenblatt says strong privacy is \"by far the top feature consumers want in AI,\" so it contends that the unique privacy focus of Apple Intelligence \"could resonate\" and argues for market share lift potential for Apple in AI.\nJPMorgan upgraded FedEx (FDX) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $359, up from $296, following the fiscal Q4 report. The analyst cites the company's strategic option exploration in freight for the upgrade.\nDA Davidson upgraded Home Depot (HD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $395, up from $352. The firm cites a number of reasons for upgrading the stock as the market sits near an all-time high, including Home Depot shares being 19% off of their all-time high set in December 2021 and also 15% off of their 52-week high.\nWolfe Research upgraded Robinhood Markets (HOOD) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $29 price target after meeting with the company's CFO Jason Warnick. The firm came away \"more convicted\" in the strength and durability of Robinhood's earnings growth algorithm and its 2026 GAAP earnings estimate is 70% above consensus.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Repligen (RGEN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $155, down from $180, following a company visit. Repligen is operating at trough EBIT margins and will likely more than double its earnings power by 2027, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nCiti downgraded Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $176, up from $172. After the 30% rally post-FDA approval and label expansion of Elevidys, Sarepta is now appropriately valued, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nPiper Sandler downgraded Aptiv (APTV) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $63, down from $78, after Rivian (RIVN) announced the establishment of a joint venture with Volkswagen (VWAGY). At first glance, the news may seem unrelated to Aptiv, but the rationale for the joint venture is a red flag for the Aptiv thesis, the analyst says.\nRosenblatt downgraded Viavi Solutions (VIAV) to Neutral from Buy with an $8.25 price target. The firm cites its \"growing worry\" that the telecom spending weakness of the last two years is more structural than cyclical for the downgrade.\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Accenture (ACN) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $300, down from $382. The analyst sees potential valuation compression for the shares from the company's decelerating cloud growth, longer-than-expected time for generative artificial intelligence revenue contribution, and more acquisition spend.\nTD Cowen downgraded MediaAlpha (MAX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $13, down from $19. The analyst cites the recent news regarding the company's ongoing investigation with the Federal Trade Commission for the downgrade.\nTop 5 Initiations:\nStifel initiated coverage of Tesla (TSLA) with a Buy rating and $265 price target. The firm thinks the revamped Model 3 and upcoming Model Y refresh should bolster sales, followed by the commencement of its next-generation vehicle Model 2 production, leading it to believe Tesla is very well positioned to deliver robust multi-year growth in 2025-27 and beyond.\nCiti initiated coverage of Deere (DE) with a Neutral rating and $395 price target. The firm's outlook for machinery \"leans neutral-to-positive,\" reflective of its even split between Buy and Neutral ratings.\nBTIG initiated coverage of Northrop Grumman (NOC) with a Buy rating and $565 price target. The analyst expects the company to be one of the fastest growing among the defense prime contractors through the remainder of the decade given its exposure to high-growth end markets like space and incumbency on multiple critical programs of record that are deemed critical to national security.\nBarclays initiated coverage of JFrog (FROG) with an Overweight rating and $50 price target. The analyst says the company benefits from organizations beginning to deploy generative artificial intelligence, which in turn supports a broadening DevOps total addressable market.\nBarclays initiated coverage of Monday.com (MNDY) with an Overweight rating and $275 price target.

He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund\u2019s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg\u2019s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees.

However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium\u2019s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander\u2019s imposition of \u201ctight guardrails\u201d to limit losses. \u00a0To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. \u00a0A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices.

TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\u201cConsumers may find purchasing Microsoft\u2019s AI PC confusing (calculating whether it reaches 40 TOPS before purchase), whereas Apple directly tells consumers which models can support Apple Intelligence. Regardless of whether on-device AI applications meet consumer needs, Apple has a clear selling advantage from the start,\u201d Kuo said.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given the company\u2019s 9.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But all of that could change if Apple is able to actually implement and convert the AI features it recently announced at WWDC.\nDan Ives of Wedbush, one of the biggest Apple bulls, recently said that Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will be able to create an ecosystem around its AI offerings and the company would see a $30 to $40 per share surge because of its AI products. Ives has a $275 price target on Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0shares.\nThe first signs of Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0AI capabilities are here. Last month, the company revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine, \u00a0will be \u201cmore powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\u201d Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0Neural Engine is the company\u2019s neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes \u201cowning Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in denial about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company\u2019s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company\u2019s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\nOverall, Apple Inc.

Apple referred to its March statement where it said that it was confident that its plan complies with the DMA and that it continues to constructively engage with the Commission.\nCompanies can offer remedies to address concerns laid out in the findings before a final decision expected before EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager leaves office in November, which could include fines up to 10% of a company's global annual turnover for breaches.\nThe EU investigation targets Apple's steering rules, which regulators say impose limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge, and also its new fees levied on apps developers.\nEU regulators are expected to charge Apple related to this issue, the people said, adding that a second investigation focusing on its choice screen for its Safari web browser will likely take more time.\nThe preliminary finding on Meta focuses on its recently introduced pay or consent model where users pay a subscription fee for an ad-free Facebook and Instagram, the people said.\nThe FT was the first to report that Apple would face EU charges.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey)\n"

        "Author": "  Frank Landymore ",
        "Text": "You know how creatives frequently complain about cheapskate clients offering to pay them \"in exposure\" instead of actual money?\nSounds like OpenAI knows exactly what that feels like. When Apple announced its partnership with OpenAI last week, it certainly sounded like it could have been yet another blockbuster deal for the ChatGPT developer, who has already courted billions of dollars from its big daddy backer, Microsoft.\nBut as Bloomberg reports, no hard cash changed hands as part of the deal, and neither party expects a direct boost in revenue. Apple isn't paying OpenAI, but the thinking goes that it's more than making up for this by giving the startup tons of exposure, according to Bloomberg's sources, as it thrusts ChatGPT into the hands of Apple's hundreds of millions of devices and customers.\nIn return, Apple \u2014 notably absent for so long in the generative AI race \u2014 can finally get a foothold in the field and get chatbot-crazed customers to use their devices more. And to inject some speculation on our part, perhaps Apple hopes to piggyback off ChatGPT's household status to vicariously legitimize its new in-house AI effort, \"Apple Intelligence.\"\nIn the long run, both parties obviously hope the deal will yield some additional revenue, directly or indirectly. But before they can get there, there\u00a0are still a few nagging questions.\nAI demands ludicrous amounts of processing power, and so if OpenAI sees an influx of users and a boost in how much people use its chatbot, the more it'll have to shell out to use Microsoft's servers, where its chatbot is hosted.\nNot all users will be freeloaders, however, and OpenAI will undoubtedly be banking on customers trying out its $20 per month \"ChatGPT Plus\" subscription plans and higher, which grant access to its latest large language model that features its controversial voice mode, as well as image generation via DALL\u00b7E, both big draws.\nAnd there Apple stands to benefit, too. As Bloomberg notes, any subscription purchases made through the ChatGPT app will see a cut of the transaction go to the tech giant \u2014 as much as 30 percent.\nIn sum, both parties stand to reap rewards from their new partnership, even if they may not be tangible and come with expenses along the way. But the degree of benefit may be unbalanced.\nYou can imagine that Apple, the multi-trillion dollar kingpins of the tech industry, were in a better bargaining position, and there's maybe a chuckle to be had that with all its billions, it's only paying OpenAI in \"exposure.\" If it was a deal between client and a\u00a0freelance artist desperate for a breakthrough, it'd sound exploitative. Something tells us that OpenAI, whose valuation was last reported as being upwards of $80 billion, will be just fine, though.\nMore on Apple: Tim Cook Admits Apple May Never Be Able to Make Its AI Stop Lying\n"

Apple's market capitalization was last at $3.003 trillion after its stock climbed 0.8%.\nMicrosoft, based in Redmond, Washington, remained the world's most valuable company at $3.15 trillion after its shares climbed 1.9%.\n\"Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management.\n\"It may be a foregone conclusion that Nvidia will overtake Microsoft as well. There's a lot of retail money that's piling in on what they see as a straight shot up.\"\nNvidia's stock has surged 147% so far in 2024, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors far outstripping supply as Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet race to build out their AI computing capabilities and dominate the emerging technology.\nIt has rallied nearly 30% just since May 22, when Nvidia issued its latest stellar revenue forecast.\nNvidia added nearly $150 billion in market capitalization on Wednesday, more than the entire value of AT&T.\nOptimism about AI lifted chip stocks broadly on Wednesday, with the PHLX chip index surging 4.5%. Super Micro Computer, which sells AI optimized servers built with Nvidia chips, climbed 4%.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week was the subject of wall-to-wall coverage on Taiwanese television and was mobbed by attendees when he visited the Computex tech trade fair in Taipei, where he was born before moving to the United States.\nWhile Nvidia rides a wave of AI enthusiasm on Wall Street, Apple is struggling with weak demand for iPhones and tough competition in China, the world's biggest smartphone market.\nSome investors also view Apple as lagging other technology heavyweights as they rush to build AI features into their products and services.\nAnalysts' projections for Nvidia's future earnings have outpaced its stellar stock gains. Nvidia is trading at 39 times expected earnings, making it less expensive on that basis than a year ago, when it traded at over 70 times expected earnings, LSEG data showed.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oaklnad, Calif.; Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Richard Chang)\n"

        "Author": "  Alicia Adamczyk ",
        "Text": "Nvidia stock may be getting all of the attention of late, but there are plenty of others outperforming the broader market. One is another member of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks: Apple.\nAn investment of $1,000 in Apple in June 2014 would be worth over $10,460 at Tuesday\u2019s closing price of about $209, according to calculations from Morningstar Direct. That\u2019s cumulative growth of over 946%, and an annualized return of 26.46%. (Shares on Thursday were mostly flat, trading around $214 at 3 p.m. ET.)\nThat\u2019s not quite the explosive growth Nvidia has experienced in recent months, but it still far outpaces the S&P 500 over the same time period. And if you were lucky enough to get in at AAPL\u2019s inception at the end of 1980, that $1,000 investment would be worth over $2.1 million today, with an annualized return of 19.22%.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nApple is one of seven stocks\u2014in addition to Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla\u2014that drove the stock market to new heights in 2023 and into 2024. That said, it\u2019s been one of the weaker performers of the group in recent months, with earnings rising just 1% in the latest quarter and sales declining.\nStill, Bank of America rates Apple a buy, writing in a research note published this week that the company\u2019s recent introduction of AI capabilities, called Apple Intelligence, and announcement that it will give third-party developers access to more AI features \u201cshould drive significant innovation from developers.\u201d\n\u201cWe view conversational AI with context and privacy as key to monetization of the installed base of Apple devices over time with increased productivity, higher priced apps, increased subscription and payments from partners,\u201d BofA\u2019s Wamsi Mohan writes in the report.\nMohan also points to a likely increase in consumers upgrading their iPhones in the coming years\u2014to have access to new AI features under development\u2014and Apple\u2019s ability to expand its services and other offerings as reasons to invest. In a best-case scenario, existing customers will race to upgrade their phones and iPads to get access to the AI, and those loyal to other operating systems may make the switch.\nOn the downside, softening consumer spending in general could impact the company, possibly leading to weak iPhone 15 sales\u2014and longer iPhone replacement cycles generally. Customers may also simply not be interested in the Apple Intelligence features, and demand could turn tepid after initial interest wanes. Mohan also points to two antitrust cases in the U.S. currently ongoing that could negatively impact the company, among other concerns.\nAlso at play: Because the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, the movements of companies like Apple and the rest of the Magnificent Seven\u2014either up or down\u2014can have an outsize impact. That's led some analysts and financial advisors to caution that the tech giants could be a bit overvalued, which may affect retail investors who are pouring more and more money into index funds.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled the list of the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0stands against the other quality stocks.\nInvesting in 2024 is significantly different from investing in the 1950s and onward. This is because these days investors have to. sift through thousands of stocks and countless data points and signals to separate the wheat from the chaff and make the right investment decisions. Amidst this hubris, the ability to pick out 'quality' stocks becomes important, and there's quite a lot of financial literature available that helps determine what such stocks are.\nTypically, stock analysis involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine profitability, operating strengths, cost control, asset utilization, and other metrics. Some of these are also present in financial literature that discusses quality stocks. One such research paper comes courtesy of researchers associated with Research Affiliates. They point out that metrics that typically define a quality stock include earnings stability, capital structure, profitability, accounting practices, and investing strategies. Within these, the quality factors that were also related to returns were investment strategies, dividend payouts, profitability, and accounting strategies.\nThe next thing to ask is, whether quality stocks are any different from standard run of the mill stocks when it comes to share price performance. For context, the last 12 months on the stock market have been dominated by a few key themes. These are artificial intelligence, inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth. Higher rates and inflation are bearish stock indicators, while growth and AI have proven to have kept the market buoyant at a time when rates are at two decade high levels. So, over the past year, exchange traded funds that track quality stocks have appreciated by 12% to 27%, the midpoint of which is slightly lower than the S&P 500's 23% price appreciation over the same time period. However, picking the right quality stocks appears to have its advantages as well, since the high end of the performance, i.e. 27%, is far higher than what the index has delivered.\nETFs and research aren't the only ones that talk about quality stocks. One hedge fund that's become quite well known for its focus on quality stocks is Cliff Asness\u2019 AQR Capital Management. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, AQR had a 13F investment portfolio worth $58 billion as of Q1 2024 end according to Insider Monkey's research. Close to a quarter of its portfolio is invested in the technology industry, and the second biggest category is services stocks. AQR focuses on stocks that follow its strategy of Quality Minus Junk or QMJ. According to its founder Cliff Asness, a quality stock is defined by its shareholder payouts, growth, profitability, and sound financial and general management. We recently took a look at some top AQR Capital management stocks and you can check them out by looking at 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.\nBefore we head to our list of the best quality stocks, a general overview of the stock market is relevant. Right now, investors are wondering when the first interest rate cuts might occur. The latest bit on this front came in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data from the Commerce Department. This data set revealed that the 12 month inflation in the US stood at 2.7% in April 2024, which was still higher than the Fed's preferred rate of 2%. Additionally, the data also provided investors with some bearish signals. These were apparent in the readings for consumer spending, which slowed down to 2% in the first quarter of 2024 over the robust 3.3% reading in Q4 2023.\nLower spending means less money sloshing in the economy, and while this might help reduce prices, it can also affect business performance, economic growth, and naturally, stock market performance. Data from the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that 47% of all investors polled expect a 25 basis point rate cut in September, while an additional 7.5% believe that the Fed might get generous and cut rates by as much as 50 basis points.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top quality stocks that hedge funds are buying.\nMethodology\nTo make our list of the best quality stocks to buy, we ranked the 30 largest constituents of a quality stock ETF and picked out those with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2024. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\u00a0\nThe computer and a laptop\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 150\nTech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a household name. These days, the rumor mill is adamant when it comes to Apple and AI as sources insist that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is interested in partnering up with OpenAI to bring AI functionality to its Siri virtual assistant and validate the consumer use cases for the highly hyped technology. Amidst broader concern on Wall Street about the iPhone and Apple's China woes, Wedbush's Dan Ives was filled with optimism in a May 2024 interview. During the talk, he shared that 70% of China's 225 million iPhones were yet to be upgraded, and the introduction of AI to the Pro model could very well see Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) grow the iconic Average Selling Price (ASP) in the region.\nAs Q1 2024 ended, 150 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had held a stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake which was worth $135 billion.\nDue to its heft, it's hard for a firm like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to continue to grow in triple digit percentages. However, its heft also allows the firm to generate massive amounts of cash that it then uses to buy back shares. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s latest share buybacks are worth $110 billion, which is more valuable than the market value of most companies. Additionally, a forward P/E ratio of 29.33 makes the stock slightly overvalued compared to the S&P 500.\nPolen Capital shared some of the stresses that have plagued Apple Inc.

        "Author": "  Hannah Lang ",
        "Text": "By Hannah Lang\n(Reuters) - Although Apple is discontinuing its buy now, pay later service launched last year, the company is sticking with the product, with a successor to the offering launching later this year via third-parties like Affirm.\nBuy now, pay later (BNPL) exploded in popularity as the COVID-19 pandemic forced more shoppers online, and the product has continued to resonate with consumers. BNPL loans drove $75 billion in online spending in 2023, up 14.3% from 2022, according to Adobe Analytics.\nIn a statement on Monday, Apple said its new solution \"will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe in collaboration with Apple Pay-enabled banks and lenders.\" It did not comment further about why it was ending its independent BNPL offering.\nExisting users of the BNPL service, Apple Pay Later will still be able to manage and pay open loans via the Wallet app, the company said.\nApple announced last week that Apple Pay users would be able to access new installment loan offerings this fall, including the ability to apply for BNPL loans directly through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay. Customers will also be able to access installments from credit and debit cards, the tech giant said.\nAnalysts had viewed Apple's original BNPL product as a competitor to BNPL providers like Affirm. It offered customers the ability to buy products and pay in four interest-free installments for items up to $1,000. Affirm offers users the option to pay for products in two or four installments, as well as monthly installments for higher-cost items.\n\"To me, this sounds a lot like what we see happening with debit cards,\" said Sean Gelles, director of payments intelligence at J.D. Power. \"Regardless of which debit card a consumer has funding their purchases, as long as they use Apple Pay, it\u2019s Apple that owns the experience.\"\nGelles added that if Apple's new portfolio of BNPL products are delivered via Apple Pay there would be \"minimal risk for Apple as they will thereby retain the relationship with the customer.\"\nWhile Apple could choose to partner with additional BNPL providers in the future -- such as Affirm rival Klarna -- a source familiar with the matter highlighted Affirm's technology and underwriting expertise, as well as the company's choice to not charge users late fees.\nKlarna declined to comment.\nShares in Affirm were last down 0.7% on the day, a move that one analyst chalked up to weaker-than-expected retail sales data in May.\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in New York; additional reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh; editing by Megan Davies and David Gregorio)\n"

        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Well, it's official: Another company has surpassed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) market cap. Last week, Nvidia became the second-largest U.S. company, trailing only Microsoft.\nIt was another blow to Apple, whose revenue remains stuck in neutral. And it's facing a federal antitrust lawsuit.\nIndeed, given Apple's struggles and the impressive growth of some of its fellow tech megacaps, several more companies will likely surpass Apple's market value over the next decade. I expect Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) will be among them.\nAs of this writing, Alphabet has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, trailing Apple by \"only\" $900 billion.\nAt first blush, that gap might seem insurmountable, but for a megacap, it's entirely feasible. Nvidia, for instance, closed a recent gap of $1.8 trillion with Apple in less than six months.\nAnd Alphabet is up by about 26% year to date, while Apple is up just 6%. That means the former has shrunk the lead of the latter by about $275 billion so far this year. If that trend continues, Alphabet will surpass Apple in size within a couple of years.\nThat might turn out to be too much to expect, but over the long term, I do think Alphabet will catch up.\u00a0First and foremost, Apple is a hardware company. It designs and sells computers, tablets, watches, and smartphones. Alphabet, on the other hand, is a software company. Its signature business is internet search through Google. It makes most of its money by selling digital ads. Crucially, digital advertising is cheap and easy to scale; mass production of physical electronics is not. \nWhat's more, Apple has put its signature product, the iPhone, into the hands of almost every human being who might want one. With an estimated 1.4 billion iPhones in use today, there's little room for it to grow its share of that key market.\nConversely, Alphabet's revenue grew 15% in the first quarter. The company relies on digital ad revenue (from its Google search business and YouTube), subscription revenue (YouTube, Google Fiber), and data center revenue from its Google Cloud segment. Those diversified revenue streams will help keep its growth humming along well into the future.\u00a0\nE-commerce and cloud services leader Amazon has a market cap of $1.9 trillion, which trails Apple by about $1.2 trillion.\nBut like Alphabet, Amazon has narrowed the gap this year. Amazon shares have rallied by 22% year to date, with the company's market cap increasing by about $300 billion, while Apple has gained around $150 billion. If Amazon keeps closing the gap at that rate, it could catch Apple in around four years.\nThat isn't out of the question. Amazon's annual revenue is almost $600 billion -- roughly the same size as Sweden's entire economy in 2022. Moreover, the company is growing sales by 13% year over year, with its expansive e-commerce business and its industry-leading cloud services division, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nMoreover, the pace and size of advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) could further accelerate that growth. AWS is a key driver for Amazon's profits, and that segment is in position to capitalize on this revolution. AI-powered apps require enormous computing power, the sort that can only be provided by high-performance data centers, many of which are run by AWS.\nAmazon is a tech juggernaut that is likely to continue growing -- and growing faster than Apple.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "I tend to follow Warren Buffett's investing approach of holding stocks forever. I rarely sell, and if I do, it's a losing position that I don't believe will ever recover. I let my winners run so I don't miss out on future returns.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of my biggest winners. I've held shares of the tech giant for over a decade. It has grown into my largest holding by a wide margin (it's nearly 50% bigger than my second-largest holding). My outsized exposure to Apple stock has made me consider trimming my position. Here's why I'm contemplating a partial sale and my potential exit strategy.\nI have a very diversified investment portfolio. Because of that, even though Apple is my top holding by a wide margin, it's currently only about 3.5% of my total portfolio's value. However, the tech giant comprises about 30% of my Roth IRA's value, which is three times higher than my second-largest holding in that account.\nOn the one hand, having a high exposure to Apple is very Buffett-like. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, currently counts Apple as its largest holding, at 42.9% of its investment portfolio. However, even Buffett has been trimming his Apple position (his company sold 13% of its stake last quarter and 1% in the fourth quarter of last year).\nWhile Buffett hinted that he has been selling Apple for tax purposes (in case capital gains taxes rise following the election), taxes aren't an issue in my case. Instead, I'm more concerned about Apple's rising valuation and slowing growth. Apple currently trades at more than 30 times forward earnings, which is on the high side of its recent historical ranges: \nAAPL data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\nThat puts Apple's valuation higher than the S&P 500 (22 times forward price to earnings, or P/E) and the Nasdaq-100 (28.5 times).\nTrading at a premium valuation wouldn't be a concern if Apple were growing fast. However, its revenue declined in its 2023 fiscal year (down 3%) while earnings per share was up only modestly (0.3%). Those trends have continued through the first two quarters of fiscal 2024.\nWhile Apple's growth has slowed considerably, an acceleration could be ahead. The company recently made a big splash in the AI market by revealing Apple Intelligence, which could accelerate iPhone sales and its financial results.\nApple's stock price and valuation have soared since it launched Apple Intelligence. Because of that, I'm considering selling some of my shares to cash in on the enthusiasm.\nHowever, I don't want to sell right now because AI mania could send shares much higher. Instead, I've decided to start writing covered calls on a portion of my position. This options trading strategy has two benefits: \nIncome: Selling call options will generate options premium income that I can invest in other stocks. \nPotentially higher sales price: I selected an options strike price about 20% above Apple's recent trading price, which gives me more upside potential. \nIf Apple stock surges above the option's strike price at expiration, I can let my shares get called away and lock in a higher profit than if I simply sold them at the current price. Meanwhile, if shares are close to or below the strike price at expiration, I can either roll my options forward or write new ones for additional income. \nWriting call options on some of my Apple stock is a potential win-win strategy. I can earn a little additional income while waiting to sell my shares at a much higher price. While this approach does cap my upside on these shares to the strike price (plus options premium), I will retain unlimited upside on the Apple shares I don't cover with calls. \nApple is a fantastic company that I plan to own for many more years. However, it has grown into my top holding (and an outsized percentage of my Roth IRA). Because of that, I'm thinking of trimming it back, given its elevated valuation. I'm doing that by writing call options on some of my shares. This more patient strategy could yield a higher sales price or at least some additional income from a stock trading at an elevated valuation. \nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GlobalData ",
        "Text": "The US\u2019s most popular mobile wallet, Apple Pay, announced it is dropping its Apple Pay Later instalment loan scheme, which launched in March 2023 as an addition to the country\u2019s competitive buy now pay later (BNPL) landscape. Instead, Apple will continue offering BNPL loans at Apple Pay-accepting checkouts in the US through the third-party provider Affirm.\nAlthough the US is the biggest BNPL market by value globally, GlobalData\u2019s E-commerce Analytics shows that BNPL payments only account for 5.8% of the US ecommerce market.\nThe BNPL market has seen steady growth globally since the emergence of Klarna and Afterpay in the 2010s, but providers\u2019 operating models are being challenged now more than ever. Firstly, the 5.25 percentage-point raise of the Fed funds rate since March 2022 has made the financing of these loans more expensive.\nThe increasing cost of living during this period shrunk disposable incomes and resulted in higher default rates and a general slowdown in spending. Most recently, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a rule to extend the Truth in Lending Act to BNPL services, to align consumer protection measures with existing credit card regulations.\nCompliance costs therefore will add to the issue of already thinning margins of BNPL operators who continue to compete in the US\u2019s fragmented BNPL market. Just over a year after Apple Pay Later\u2019s launch, Apple found itself in position whereby it was unlikely to generate meaningful profits from offering instalment loans in this market environment, and it will now instead embed a well-known provider\u2019s BNPL product to maintain Apple Pay\u2019s competitive edge in the US mobile wallet landscape. Affirm is the preferred BNPL provider of choice for 21% of Americans, just 1pp behind the leading PayPal Pay in 3 solution and closely followed by Afterpay with 17%, as per GlobalData\u2019s Buy Now Pay Later Analytics 2023.\nSource: GlobalData\u2019s Buy Now Pay Later Analytics 2023\nAs more consolidation can be expected among BNPL firms against the current market backdrop in the US, Apple found new ways through Apple Pay for keeping current users in and bringing new ones into its ecosystem. Besides Affirm\u2019s integration arriving with the next update in October 2024, iPhone users will now be able to send and receive Apple Cash in real time by the tap of two phones. The Tap to Cash function will facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) payments on the spot through NFC technology, without the need to exchange any information.\nDespite the use case\u2019s limitation of having to be physically present, the service will be welcomed by Americans, whose top considerations for sending money are speed, simplicity, and a trusted brand, according to GlobalData\u2019s P2P Payments Analytics 2023. Apple\u2019s rapid exit from the BNPL market to focus on the ecosystem-strengthening functions of Apple Pay is therefore in line with the company\u2019s wider strategy.\nBlandina Hanna Szalay is an analyst in banking & payments at GlobalData\n\"Apple partners with Affirm to maintain competitive edge in US mobile wallet space\" was originally created and published by Electronic Payments International, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) -Apple on Thursday was hit with a proposed class action accusing the tech giant of paying more than 12,000 female employees in California less than men with comparable jobs.\nThe lawsuit filed in state court in San Francisco by two women who have worked at Apple for more than a decade claims the company systematically underpays female workers in its engineering, marketing, and AppleCare divisions.\nApple bases workers' starting pay on their salaries at previous jobs or on their \"pay expectations,\" which results in lower pay rates for women, according to the complaint. The lawsuit also claims that Apple's performance evaluation system, which it uses to set raises and bonuses, is biased against women.\nCupertino, California-based Apple in a statement said it is committed to inclusion and pay equity.\n\"Since 2017, Apple has achieved and maintained gender pay equity and every year we partner with an independent third-party expert to examine each team member\u2019s total compensation and make adjustments, where necessary, to ensure that we maintain pay equity,\" the company said.\nEve Cervantez, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Apple's practices perpetuate and widen existing gender pay gaps.\n\u201cThis is a no-win situation for female employees at Apple,\u201d Cervantez said in a statement.\nThe plaintiffs are represented by class action law firms Outten & Golden, Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll and Altshuler Berzon. The firms have brokered massive settlements in other sex bias cases, including a $215 million deal with Goldman Sachs last year and a $175 million settlement with Sterling Jewelers in 2022. Those companies denied wrongdoing.\nCalifornia has since 2018 prohibited employers from asking job applicants about their salary history with the goal of eliminating pay gaps based on sex and race.\nAccording to Thursday's lawsuit, Apple instead relies on applicants' pay expectations to set their salaries. But because most workers provide a figure that is slightly higher than what they earned at their last job, the practice has the same effect of perpetuating wage disparities, the lawsuit says.\nApple also rewards employees who are deemed to have \"talent\" by paying them more but disproportionately grants that designation to men, the plaintiffs claim.\nThe lawsuit accuses Apple of violating California's Equal Pay Act, which bars sex discrimination in pay, and state laws prohibiting workplace sex bias and unfair business practices.\nOne of the plaintiffs, Justina Jong, also claims that Apple refused to transfer her to a different team after she complained about sexual harassment by a coworker. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and penalties.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Aurora Ellis, Alexia Garamfalvi and Josie Kao)\n"

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors haven't had it easy over the last year as the company faced repeated hits to its business. The company's stock has risen 17% over the last 12 months, significantly less than the 48% it increased in the calendar year of 2023.\nMacroeconomic headwinds curbed consumer spending, leading to reductions in product sales. Meanwhile, critics questioned Apple's role in artificial intelligence (AI), as many of its rivals seemingly pulled ahead. However, recent developments indicate a recovery is underway.\nShares in Apple have popped 11% since June 10, when the company hosted its Worldwide Developer Conference. The tech giant debuted its new Apple Intelligence AI platform, unveiling new generative features for iPhones, Macs, and iPads.\nApple's long-awaited AI initiative has made Wall Street bullish and saw the iPhone maker briefly retake its spot as the world's most valuable company on June 12, hitting a market cap of $3.26 trillion. As a result, Apple is now neck and neck with Microsoft's $3.27 trillion market cap.\nSo here's why it's not too late to invest in Apple, with its stock a screaming buy this June.\nApple hosted what was possibly its biggest Worldwide Developer Conference ever on June 10, unveiling a host of new AI capabilities through Apple Intelligence. The platform can generate language and original images, smartly prioritize notifications, and analyze personal data to answer specific commands like, \"Play the song Steve messaged me\" or \"Show me the picture of Claire in the red dress at the beach.\"\nApple Intelligence will introduce AI writing tools that can rewrite and edit text in messages, notes, or essays. The company also revealed a major upgrade to its smart assistant, Siri, making it more personalized, natural, and contextually relevant. One of the most significant updates to Siri will be its ability to tap into OpenAI's ChatGPT for specific questions, representing the start of a new partnership between the companies.\nMoreover, Apple strategically made Apple Intelligence available only to select devices, including Apple silicon Macs and iPads running M1 through M4 chips and iPhone 15 Pro models. The move could attract a rush of consumers looking to upgrade their products so they can access the company's new AI features.\nProduct sales have been a sore point for Apple this year, with quarterly revenue declining in each of its three product segments since the start of 2024 (as seen in the chart above). However, an AI expansion could be just the motivation consumers need to try out Apple's latest products.\nThe AI market has exploded over the last 12 months. Excitement over the generative technology has been a major growth driver in the Nasdaq Composite's rise of 31% since last June. Dozens of tech companies' stocks have soared, making it increasingly expensive for new investors to back the budding AI market.\nCompanies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia have enjoyed stellar gains thanks to AI. Meanwhile, Apple's more reserved approach to the industry has seen its stock trickle up at a slower rate. However, Apple's more gradual approach to AI could be why now is the best time to invest.\nThe company's stock is a better value than many of its rivals. Meanwhile, recent developments suggest Apple is only just getting started in AI, a market with plenty of room left to run and projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030.\nThis chart uses the forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio to compare the stock valuations of some of the most prominent companies in AI. Apple's shares are the best value on both fronts, with the lowest figures for both metrics.\nMoreover, Apple's free cash flow of $102 billion is significantly higher than that of Amazon, Microsoft, or Nvidia, indicating the iPhone company could be best equipped to overcome potential headwinds and keep expanding in AI.\nAnd that means now is an excellent time to buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Nikolaos Sismanis ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of the most remarkable investment success stories in the tech world over the past couple of decades. Yet, despite its behemoth status, Apple\u2019s success is heavily reliant on a network of partners and suppliers. In fact, numerous external companies play crucial roles in powering Apple\u2019s ecosystem. And, they inherently reap the benefits of Apple\u2019s success through their collaboration.\nMore specifically, Apple conducts the majority of its research and development and in-house production. Also, it depends on third-party suppliers for necessary parts, cutting-edge technologies and other critical services.\nI can\u2019t stress enough that these partnerships are indispensable. Without them, it\u2019s safe to say that Apple\u2019s flagship products, such as iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and Apple Watches, wouldn\u2019t have achieved their remarkable success. Accordingly, as Apple keeps innovating and expanding its product lines, its partners are increasingly poised to grow in tandem.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nLet\u2019s explore how Apple\u2019s key partners are also set to reap substantial benefits.\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\nOne key partner benefiting from its close ties with Apple is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Broadcom plays a pivotal role in Apple\u2019s supply chain by providing crucial semiconductor solutions that power pretty much every Apple device. From iPhones to iPads and Macs, Broadcom\u2019s chips are indispensable. They enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, thus cementing Broadcom\u2019s position as a vital partner for Apple.\nAnd, because of AVGO\u2019s strategic partnership with AAPL, the company enjoys quite predictable cash flows. Since most device manufacturers utilize its connectivity solutions, Broadcom operates on a backlog basis in order to serve all of its customers. Therefore, its revenues tend to consistently grow over time despite the electronic devices industry itself being highly cyclical.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) advancements are likely to drive a new super cycle of electronic device sales. These include Apple rolling out Apple Intelligence along with iPhone 16. Thus, it seems that Broadcom remains well positioned for continued top and bottom-line growth. This catalyst should keep fueling its bullish case moving forward.\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\nAnother significant company that powers Apple\u2019s devices is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSMC). The Taiwan-based semiconductor foundry giant is the primary manufacturer of Apple\u2019s custom-designed chips. This includes the mighty A-series processors found in iPhones, iPads and the M-series chips powering Macs.\nInterestingly, Apple\u2019s shift toward custom silicon has further strengthened TSMs\u2019 already monopolistic position in the semiconductor industry. As the exclusive producer of Apple\u2019s advanced chips, TSM has benefited tremendously in recent years. TSM\u2019s role appears irreplaceable. It essentially runs a monopoly in the semiconductor foundry industry. Further, its revenues have risen at a rapid compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.7% over the past decade.\nTherefore, as Apple expands its product lineup and enhances chip performance, TSM\u2019s expertise in advanced semiconductor manufacturing ensures it remains a critical partner in Apple\u2019s supply chain.\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\nThe last pick on my list is Corning (NYSE:GLW). The specialty materials company plays an essential role in Apple\u2019s product lineup. It supplies Gorilla Glass, the durable cover glass used in almost all of Apple\u2019s devices with a screen.\nGiven Corning\u2019s expertise in glass technology, I don\u2019t think Apple is about to find another partner to replace Corning anytime soon. Therefore, Corning\u2019s financials are likely to keep benefiting, especially with the iPhone 16 release potentially coinciding with a smartphone supercycle.\nEvidently, despite an 11.3% decline in Corning\u2019s revenues to $12.6 billion last year due to weakened global smartphone sales, Wall Street remains optimistic about a robust recovery ahead. In particular, consensus estimates suggest revenues could rebound to about $14.0 billion and $14.8 billion in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively. This aligns with industry-wide expectations of a new smartphone super cycle.\nAn interesting aspect of Corning\u2019s investment case is that the stock could be a compelling dividend growth pick. The company has already increased its dividend for 13 consecutive years, while shares are currently attached to a dividend yield of 3%. While the dividend has grown at a rather modest CAGR of 5.3% over the past three years, dividend growth could re-accelerate, with sales expected to rebound notably in the coming years.\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of top 10 AI stocks Wall Street analysts are upgrading. Apple ranks 5th in the list. That's why the stock deserves a deeper look.\nThere has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future \u2014 productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn\u2019t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a \"wall of money\" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.\nOne doesn\u2019t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors. Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that investors have been \"hesitant\" for much of the year, but they should just \"stick\" with \"what's working.\" AI, weight loss drugs and related themes is what's working these days, according to Lee.\nMethodology\nFor this article we picked the top AI stocks Wall Street analysts recently upgraded or gave bullish comments about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Alexandr Bormotin on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes \"owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return\" because the market is in denial about Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI potential.\nThe Wall Street is running out of patience with Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0amid Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0AI strategy that's been so far nonexistent and lagging behind competitors. But Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0bulls believe Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will shine through in the AI race. The market is now awaiting the WWDC event where Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is expected to reveal its AI plans. Dan Ives of Wedbush, one of the biggest Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0bulls, recently said that WWDC \u00a0is the \"most important event for Apple in over a decade as the pressure to bring a generative AI stack of technology for developers and consumers is front and center.\"\nIves thinks Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will be able to create an ecosystem around its AI offerings and Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0would see a $30 to $40 per share surge because of its AI products. Ives has a $275 price target on Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0shares.\nApple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a09.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But all of this could change if Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is able to pull AI-related catalysts out of its bag. The WWDC event and the new few weeks and months would be critical for Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0growth trajectory.\nThe first signs of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine, \u00a0will be \u201cmore powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\u201d Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0Neural Engine is Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company\u2019s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company\u2019s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\nOverall, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th\u00a0in Insider Monkey\u2019s list of Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks.\u00a0You can visit Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks to see the other AI stocks that are on analysts' radar.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other hardware stocks.\nWith the first half of 2024 nearly over, artificial intelligence continues to play a dominant role in the stock market. Stocks that either design semiconductors that are used for AI applications, or those that use them to either streamline their internal operations such as coding or offer products to customers have also made significant gains. These show the optimism in Wall Street for accelerated computing technologies, which are collectively called artificial intelligence.\nIn fact, the impact of AI has been so strong that not only has it upended the status quo of the most valuable firms in terms of market capitalization, but it also allowed some of the top AI companies to post triple digit percentage share price returns over the course of the past twelve months. Some of the top performing AI stocks are up by 213% over the past twelve months and have appreciated by 773% since November 2022. Back then, the stock market was whimpering in the aftermath of rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which had hit technology stocks particularly hard since they benefit from a fast growth and low rate environment.\nHowever, AI's impact on the stock market has fueled the triple digit percentage gains in some stocks since then. At the same time, it has also meant that major indexes continue to demonstrate robust performance that is fueled by the share price performance of mega cap technology stocks.\nIn 2024, the market has moved forward from investing in AI companies that can change the world with their hardware or software to evaluating whether these firms are delivering. The first quarter of the 2024 earnings season was the clearest example of this phenomenon, and it saw Wall Street take an unforgiving approach to large and small firms that presented even the slightest hint of being unable to either grow their revenues by targeting AI or control the costs of investing in the new technologies.\nWithin the AI industry, there are different categories of firms. Most of these, such as OpenAI, operate on the software side. This industry subsegment develops applications such as chat bots and other assistants along with expanding the use of AI to existing software such as image editing tools. AI hardware companies power these applications, and when compared to the software firms, not only do they command stable valuations, but they also see investors take comfort in the fact that the demand for their products is far more stable and predictable when compared to software demand. Recently Goldman Sachs published a bullish report on hardware stocks due to AI, which we covered in 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman. In this article we are going to approach the same theme from a different angle and there are vast differences between both rankings of hardware stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top hedge fund hardware stock picks, we ranked personal computing, semiconductor, and computer hardware by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected. Basically our article listed the best hardware stocks to buy according to the 900+ equity hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Why do we care about what hedge funds do?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's biggest consumer technology company. Despite its limited actions on the front, Apple has been seeing a lot of coverage for its potential AI initiatives. Most of these have covered its Siri virtual assistant, and some quarters expect an AI revamp for Siri. The average of 39 one year analyst share price targets for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares is $204.31 and the stock is rated Buy on average. Well known Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) analyst Gene Munster shared optimism for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI potential recently when he shared that the market was in \"denial\" about its AI potential. He was joined by Wedbush's Dan Ives, who believes that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock could jump by as much as $40 because of AI.\nDuring Q1 2024, 150 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stakeholders. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the most valuable stake which was worth $135 billion.\nRiverPark Large Growth fund shared in its Q1 2024 investor letter that a strong installed user base is one of Apple Inc.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other hardware stocks.\nThe soaring popularity of artificial intelligence for consumer and business applications has injected fresh life into the computing industry. If we're to rewind the hands of time and go back to 2022, the stock market environment was considerably different from what it is now. All major technology stocks, including those that are responsible for making chips that power AI workloads were down by double digit percentages in the wake of breakneck inflation and rising interest rates.\nFast forward to 2024 and the rise in valuations seems to have no end in sight. One bank that's quite optimistic about artificial intelligence is Goldman. Goldman's analyst teams are among the best in the world, and they spend countless hours analyzing stocks and industries for the right set of picks that could disrupt the industry.\nOn this front, Goldman came out with a note recently that outlined a new beginning for the computer hardware industry. According to the bank, the introduction of AI has necessitated a global shift to new hardware that can support the technology. In its note, the bank's analysts shared:\nDuring the pandemic, the tech hardware industry peaked as the majority of work-from-home employees purchased equipment. The space currently has fully unwind this cycle and we notice stocks like HPQ trading at 9x their 2025 earnings estimates.\nGoldman also created a basket of stocks where the highest weighted stock has an 8% weight and there are 20 stocks in the basket. According to Goldman analyst Faris Mourad:\nThe basket is composed of technology hardware stocks that may benefit from PC and mobile device renovations that could include AI features. The basket can trade up to $250m in one day with no name exceeding 10% of ADV.\nConsidering this optimism, we decided to take a look at the top Goldman's top 15 hardware stock picks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top Goldman Sachs hardware stocks, we used the top holdings of the bank's PC & Mobile Device AI Upgrades basket (GSXUPCAI).\nFor these hardware stocks, we also mentioned hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 150 \nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is all the buzz in the AI and technology industry this June. While its shares had remained lackluster before, the stock jumped by 10% after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s WWDC conference. At the event, it introduced a slew of AI features called 'Apple Intelligence', which will bring on device AI capabilities to the iPhone, and also allow users to run more complex workloads on a secure cloud environment. After the event, Rosenblatt kept a $186 share price target and a Neutral rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares. At the heart of the note was a key observation, which outlined that while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) might have introduced AI in its products, only the latest gadgets with the A17 processor can use the features. As a result, Rosenblatt remained cautious about pricing in AI euphoria in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a forward price to earnings ratio of 29. This is higher than the S&P's 21, and it shows that investors expect the stock to grow slightly faster than the market. Aristotle Atlantic Partners mentioned the firm in its Q1 2024 investor letter and shared:\nApple contributed to portfolio performance in the first quarter due to the strategy\u2019s underweight relative to the benchmark. Investors continue to be concerned about weak handset sales globally, as well as declining market share and competitive dynamics in the Chinese market, as Huawei has returned to the market with a more competitive premium-priced handset.

One of the key features revealed was Siri\u2019s ability to relay user questions to ChatGPT when necessary, with user consent required before any data, documents, or photos are sent to the AI. The responses would then be delivered directly by Siri, powered by OpenAI\u2019s latest iteration of ChatGPT, GPT-4o.\nHowever, the announcement of Apple Intelligence did not trigger a price rally for AI-linked cryptocurrencies. Render (RNDR), Fetch.ai (FET), and Bittensor (TAO) have all seen declines of 7.5%, 3.5%, and 6.6% respectively over the last 24 hours, despite the buzz around AI.\nMeanwhile, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has threatened to ban the use of Apple devices at his companies if Apple integrates OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT into its iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems. Musk expressed his concerns via a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on June 10. \u201cIf Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation,\u201d Musk asserted. He even suggested that visitors to Tesla, Space Exploration Technologies Corp (SpaceX), and his other ventures would need to \"store their Apple devices in a Faraday cage\" upon entry to prevent any potential security breaches.\nMusk criticized Apple for relying on OpenAI instead of developing its own AI technology. \u201cIt is patently absurd that Apple isn\u2019t smart enough to make their own AI,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re selling you down the river. Apple using the words \u2018protect your privacy\u2019 while handing your data over to a third-party AI that they don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t themselves create is *not* protecting privacy at all.\u201d\n"

        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed higher during Wednesday's session on continued strength following the company\u2019s WWDC event.\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant has surpassed Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in market capitalization, reclaiming its title as the world's largest company.\nDays after it unveiled its consumer AI strategy, Apple has become the first brand to surpass $1 trillion in brand value, according to a global ranking by Kantar's BrandZ. This marks a 15% increase from the previous year. Earlier this week, Apple unveiled new AI features, expected to reignite demand for iPhones and reverse a sales decline.\nB of A Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained Apple with a Buy rating and maintained a $230 price target.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.47%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,278,420 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $255,684 or around 1,200 shares.\nRead This: Jim Cramer Likes This Energy Stock With 4% Yield, Recommends Buying DraftKings\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 2.9% to close at $213.07 on Wednesday.\nCheck This Out: How to Find Dividend Stocks: Scan, Analyze, and Capture with Benzinga Pro\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Share prices of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) got a nice boost recently, jumping after the company unveiled Apple Intelligence, directly tapping into the outsized enthusiasm for all things artificial intelligence (AI) related. Apple Intelligence includes a suite of generative AI tools such as content and image generation, in addition to an improved Siri assistant.\nThe move is Apple's attempt to reassert its leadership in consumer tech. It should help Apple convince consumers to upgrade their smartphones at a time when the company has been struggling with a lengthening upgrade cycle. The price boost after the news was announced suggests investors are happy with the announcement.\nOne Wall Street analyst is also jumping on the bandwagon.\nApple Intelligence won't be its own revenue segment in Apple's financials, but it's expected to be a significant incentive for some segments investors focus on. For instance, it's likely to spark more iPhone upgrades and encourage developers to build generative AI apps on iOS that should boost service segment revenue.\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated a buy rating on the tech leader with a price target of $230, implying an 8% upside over the next year from where the stock traded at Wednesday's close. Mohan argued that consensus estimates for iPhone sales are too low at 241 million and 238 million for the calendar years 2025 and 2026, respectively, and said the launch of Apple Intelligence would help drive a stronger upgrade cycle.\nThe stock had been a laggard in the AI race, but the Apple Intelligence launch is a reminder of how powerful its installed base of more than 2 billion devices is. Its ecosystem creates a lock-in effect and makes it easy to sell new products or use them to make its devices more attractive.\nWhile the stock is expensive, Apple still looks like a good bet to gain over the long term, especially if Apple Intelligence can give a boost to the upgrade cycle.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of the 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWhen the AI revolution began with the launch of ChatGPT, no one would have thought that down the road it would bring a huge growth catalyst for the PC industry, notorious for its cyclical nature and unpredictability. Fast forward to today, everyone is talking about PCs equipped with AI-focused equipment capable to process generative AI workloads. But in just a matter of few months why did the market feel the need for AI PCs? It all boils down to costs. GPT-4 costs $0.03 per 1,000 tokens for prompts and $0.06 for completion according to Microsoft\u2019s estimates. Consider millions of users prompting LLMs from their phones and computers. The costs of scaling such systems are not feasible. That\u2019s why the market thought allowing users to process AI-intensive workloads natively instead of using the Cloud is the future. And that caused the AI PC boom. Tech market analyst firm Canalys says AI PC shipments are expected to soar to 170 million in 2027, from 25 million in 2022. That would be a 60% share of the total PC market. The firm also expects AI PC shipments to double from 2023 to 2024 and double gain from 2024 to 2025.\nCanalys also expects vendors to ship 205 million AI-capable PCs in 2028, representing a CAGR of 44% from 2024 through 2028.\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 919 hedge funds and picked 8 AI PC stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nMorgan Stanley said in a report last month that Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is one of the stocks that could benefit from the rise of AI PCs. Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0skeptics have long believed that Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0almost always makes its own way and Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet. The first signs of Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine, \u00a0will be \u201cmore powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\u201d Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0Neural Engine is Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\nAfter the latest AI announcements at the WWDC event, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in \u201cdenial\u201d about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nApple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock\u2019s overvalued, given Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company\u2019s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company\u2019s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In particular, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT are racing for the spot of the most valuable company. Last week, Apple reclaimed the most valuable company title, edging out Microsoft, but is unable to sustain the momentum. The iPhone maker currently has a market cap of $3.26 trillion, whereas the software maker boasts $3.29 trillion.AppleApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally catching up following the launch of the latest AI features at its long-anticipated Worldwide Developers Conference. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple (read: Apple Jumps on the AI Bandwagon: ETFs to Buy).The iPhone maker unveiled a brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence for iPhones, iPads and Macs. The technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. Apple announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which provides customers access to ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost.Apple reported robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, beating both earnings and revenue estimates. The tech giant unveiled the largest buyback in the company's history and lifted its dividend payment.MicrosoftThe world's largest software maker also reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, beating earnings and revenue estimates, driven by the strong demand for cloud and artificial intelligence offerings.Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into AI in a bid to turbocharge its growth, particularly its cloud computing services, and is now reaping the fruits. About 7% of the increase in Azure revenues came from AI. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call that 65% of Fortune 500 companies are using the Azure service that delivers OpenAI's technology to businesses.

Both stocks currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Momentum Score of A, along with a solid Zacks Industry Rank in the top 23%.Though Microsoft has a Growth Score of B, meaning that it is primed for strong growth, Apple looks relatively cheaper at the current levels as it is trading at a P/E ratio of 32.30 versus 37.60 for Microsoft. Apple\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 7.3% for the fiscal year (ending Sep 2024), lower than the industry average of 30.68%. However, its revenues will likely increase 0.4%, much higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 0.03% (read: Can Dow Jones ETFs Soar Even Higher After Hitting 40K Mark?).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.75, up from 1.82 a month ago, made by 30 brokerage firms. Of those deriving the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 60% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 56.67%, whereas Buy represented 10%.Meanwhile, Microsoft has an ABR of 1.13 made by 39 brokerage firms. Of these deriving the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 89.74% and 7.69% of all recommendations.

The company\u2019s earnings and revenues are estimated to grow 19.98% and 15.33%, respectively, for the current fiscal year (ending June 2024), much higher than the average industry growth of 11.50% and 6.67%.\nBased on the above discussion, Apple and Microsoft are in a tough battle and investors should include both stocks in their portfolios to tap growth. Good tidings are in the cards for Apple, given its cheap valuation, strong ABR and new AI innovations. Then again, Microsoft is poised for above-average growth, given its solid earnings and growth estimates (see: all the Technology ETFs here).As such, investors seeking to invest in both companies at the same time could look at Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT and iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW.

That would also be the smallest month-over-month rise since October 2023.\nA decline in energy prices will likely contribute to further downward pressure on headline CPI, according to Bank of America.\n\"Energy prices likely fell in May on a seasonally adjusted basis owing to a decline in gasoline prices. This likely was a relief for consumers after gas prices had increased in April and March,\" BofA economists Stephen Juneau and Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients last week. \"With crude prices moving lower, gas prices are likely to continue to decline in the near-term.\"\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in May are expected to have risen 3.5% over last year \u2014 a slight slowdown from the 3.6% annual increase seen in April, according to Bloomberg data. Core prices are expected to have climbed 0.3% month over month in May, matching April.\nCore inflation has remained stubbornly elevated due to higher costs of shelter and core services like insurance and medical care. But BofA expects those categories \"to make a very small step in the right direction.\"\n\"Shelter inflation was likely a little firmer this month owing to an increase in lodging away from home prices,\" said Juneau and Gapen. \"However, core services ex shelter should show some moderation as we look for softer increases in several service categories.\"\nRead more here.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) fell more than 3% Tuesday to hit the lowest level this month.

        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: \nDA Davidson upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $230, up from $200. The firm believes the artificial intelligence capabilities Apple unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference will lead to an iPhone upgrade cycle.\nExane BNP Paribas upgraded Robert Half (RHI) to Outperform from Underperform with an $80 price target. The firm upgraded the staffing sector, expecting growth to improve and for the earnings downgrade cycle to turn positive.\nExane BNP Paribas upgraded ManpowerGroup (MAN) to Outperform from Underperform with a $92 price target. The firm believes the staffing sector is close to its lows and momentum will improve.\nBTIG upgraded Staar Surgical (STAA) to Buy from Neutral with a $46 price target. The company has reset numbers to the point that they are in a good spot to be beat with unit volume growth expectations essentially zero in fiscal 2024, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nNoble Capital upgraded AZZ Inc. (AZZ) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $95 price target. With the new greenfield plant construction in Washington, Missouri expected to be completed in fiscal year 2025, the firm sees \"an increasingly favorable cash flow growth profile\" and thinks AZZ could more aggressively pursue acquisitions once its effort to deleverage the balance sheet is complete.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nExane BNP Paribas downgraded Comcast (CMCSA) to Underperform from Neutral with a $34 price target. The firm believes the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program will bring an increasingly volatile period across the U.S. telecommunications and cable space.\nWedbush downgraded CoreCivic (CXW) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $14, down from $19, after the Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified the company of its intention to terminate their service agreement for the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas\nB. Riley downgraded Squarespace (SQSP) to Neutral from Buy with a $43 price target after the company's board accepted an all-cash offer of $44 per share from private equity group Permira.\nJPMorgan downgraded Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $17, down from $23. The firm sees weakening fundamentals, growing capex needs through 2028 and a lack of near-term growth, unlike most peers in the space.\nDeutsche Bank downgraded NexPoint Residential (NXRT) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $38. The firm says its thesis of an \"excessively discounted valuation\" on interest rate concerns has largely played out.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nJPMorgan initiated coverage of Shopify (SHOP) with an Overweight rating and $74 price target. The firm believes the company's product breadth, ease of use, and scale are \"distinct competitive advantages that will continue to fuel industry-leading growth.\"\nBernstein initiated coverage of On Holding (ONON) with an Outperform rating and $50 price target. The firm believes the company can sustain \"strong double-digit growth.\"\nCiti initiated coverage of GE Vernova (GEV) with a Neutral rating and $183 price target. The firm believes GE Vernova is well positioned to benefit from increasingly favorable demand trends across much of its portfolio, but given an elevated valuation multiple that largely reflects expected favorable demand trends and improving profitability, the stock's near-term risk/reward is relatively balanced.\nEvercore ISI initiated coverage of Confluent (CFLT) with an Outperform rating and $35 price target. The firm believes Confluent is the \"runaway market leader\" in the nascent $60B data streaming market.\nGoldman Sachs initiated coverage of Rocket Lab (RKLB) with a Neutral rating and $4.50 price target. The firm says the company is currently EBITDA and free cash flow negative, in an investment cycle with Neutron, and the level of, and path to, future profitability has uncertainty.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of the\u00a0Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world\u2019s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades \u201cwell into\u201d overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.\u00a0 QQQ tracks \u00a0the Nasdaq-100 Index and it\u2019s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 14-day RSI is over 61, worse than 95.24% of 2921 companies in the Software industry. \u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the third-biggest holding of the QQQ ETF, which is also entering the overbought territory based on its RSI metric according to a latest note by BTIG.\nMorgan Stanley said in a report last month that Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is one of the stocks that could benefit from the rise of AI PCs. Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0skeptics have long believed that Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0almost always makes its own way and Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet. The first signs of Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine, \u00a0will be \u201cmore powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\u201d Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0Neural Engine is Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in \u201cdenial\u201d about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It\u2019s more than evident now that just a handful of technology companies account for most of the gains in the market, thanks to the AI-fueled rally that is favoring only those companies that are leading in the AI arms race. Barclays analyst Venu Krishna recently said in a report that \u201cBig Tech\u201d has \u00a0\u201clargely carried the broader U.S. equity market through 1Q24 earnings results.\u201d Krishna said that Q1 results showed the \u201congoing dominance\u201d of Big Tech over earnings revisions and margin upside.\n\u201cThis makes it difficult to argue for a broadening of overweight allocations,\u201d Krishna added. The analyst said this dominance comes at the expense of other sectors as funds cut their exposure to cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and discretionary to go overweight on tech.\nBillionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s New AI Fund\nBillionaires and VCs are now planning to create their own AI-focused funds to attract money from investors and tap into the unprecedented opportunities unlocked by AI.

As a result, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a competitive edge over peers with its on-device AI.\n\u201cConsumers may find purchasing Microsoft\u2019s AI PC confusing (calculating whether it reaches 40 TOPS before purchase), whereas Apple directly tells consumers which models can support Apple Intelligence.

This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock\u2019s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth expectation of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company\u2019s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company\u2019s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks.

        "Title": "Apple's Big AI Reveal Underwhelms. Should You Buy the Stock Anyway?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's an old saying in investing, \"Buy the rumor, sell the news.\" The idea is that the initial excitement about a potential development for a company could drive the stock higher, with a letdown when the development actually happens. We saw this adage borne out with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) this week.\nApple stock climbed higher over the previous weeks as investors eagerly anticipated what new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities the company would announce at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). This event kicked off on Monday. Instead of enjoying a nice bump from the WWDC announcements, though, Apple's shares fell nearly 2%.\nIt seems fair to say that Apple's big AI reveal underwhelmed -- at least for some. Should you buy the stock anyway?\nLet's first address why Apple stock fell rather than jumped after its AI update. Sure, the buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news effect manifested itself. But why?\nOne culprit is that pundits had already predicted nearly all of Apple's announcements. Some of this was due to leaks from inside sources. If Apple wanted a bigger splash from its WWDC, it needed to keep its secrets better.\nOf course, it can be a good idea to allow some news to leak in advance. However, with this strategy, Apple needed a big surprise to reveal at the WWDC event, and there were no big surprises.\nA key part of the problem was that Apple's updates were somewhat boring. Several of the new iPhone capabilities have been in Android smartphones for a while. Other capabilities were already available via third-party apps. Indeed, some observers noted that Apple undercut the business models of quite a few of these third parties.\nBefore we dismiss Apple's updates altogether, it's important to point out that the stock rebounded on Tuesday. I suspect some investors were able to recognize the value in Apple's announcements after having a little time to digest everything.\nI won't parse through every new capability Apple revealed. You can easily find comprehensive reviews of all of the updates online. However, there were three things I think are especially noteworthy.\nFirst, Apple's version of AI (called Apple Intelligence) will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro and later iPhone models. This could spur many owners of older iPhone models to upgrade their phones. If they do, it would likely enable Apple to return to solid revenue growth.\nSecond, I wouldn't underestimate the appeal of Apple's emphasis on privacy. The company stressed the on-device processing with user data remaining private. It also introduced Private Cloud Compute, a cloud service that Apple claims \"sets a new standard for privacy in AI.\"\nThird, WWDC was just the beginning of Apple's renewed AI efforts. As Andreessen Horowitz partner Steven Sinofsky said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter): \"Excellent. Today was super high on 'vision' for Apple with tons of future tense.\"\nIs Apple stock a buy after its WWDC update? I have a nuanced answer.\nI understand why some view Apple's AI announcements as underwhelming. Don't get me wrong: I think Apple is introducing a lot of helpful new functionality. At the same time, though, there wasn't the \"killer app\" to wow everyone. Because of this, I'm uncertain that the WWDC will spark sustained momentum for Apple stock.\nHowever, I suspect we'll see a surge in iPhone upgrades after the new model is introduced later this year. The cumulative effect of Apple Intelligence capabilities, especially free access to ChatGPT, could be tempting for many customers.\nMost importantly, I'm confident Apple is committed to being the leader in edge AI (deploying AI on devices where data is created). This could be a big new market opportunity for the company that enables it to grow for years to come.\nShould you buy Apple stock because of what the company announced this week at the WWDC? Probably not. Should you buy Apple stock because of its long-term potential? I think so.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "A company doesn't get to a market cap of $3.3 trillion without doing some things right. This is exactly the story with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), one of the most dominant businesses on the face of the planet.\nThis type of success has made this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock a huge winner for investors. Shares have skyrocketed 838% in the past decade, a gain that outpaces the broader Nasdaq Composite index by 10 percentage points annually.\u00a0\nProspective investors might have their eyes on Apple right now. But is it too late to buy the stock?\nIt's hard for anyone to contest the assertion that Apple is a great company. In fact, it's such a high-quality business that even Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a sizable chunk, a position that represents 43.5% of the conglomerate's $388 billion portfolio.\nApple has arguably the strongest brand in the world, one that has been built up over the years thanks to its popular products and services. This brand has allowed the company to flex its pricing power. And the combination of hardware and software creates an extremely powerful ecosystem that drives customer loyalty and stickiness.\nWe also can't forget about Apple's tremendous financial position. The company's operating margin has averaged a superb 28.1% in the past five years. And this outsize profitability has resulted in the generation of vast amounts of free cash flow that management primarily uses to repurchase shares. A net cash position of $58 billion also reduces risk, which should virtually eliminate any fears that Apply will ever run into financial trouble.\nInnovation still runs hot at Apple. The business revealed its highly anticipated artificial intelligence (AI) push, known as Apple Intelligence, recently at its Worldwide Developers Conference. There are numerous new features that essentially make Apple's products and software a tool that can help people be more productive and creative in their daily lives, all with privacy and security as a top focus.\nFor all of the attractive qualities Apple possesses, a fact that no one will deny, investors need to think critically about what the potential is to achieve strong returns going forward.\nWith Apple's latest foray into AI, the hope is that sales of the iPhone will accelerate. In its latest fiscal quarter (Q2 2024 ended March 30), this single product accounted for about half of overall company revenue. Growth has certainly slowed in recent years as consumers feel less obligated to regularly upgrade to the latest device.\nPerhaps AI can change this. That's especially the belief since the features will only be available on the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, the latest models, as well as yet-to-be released models.\nBut I'm not so optimistic about this rosy outcome, particularly in the current inflationary environment we are in. And even if iPhone sales pick up, it is a monumental task moving the needle on a gargantuan trailing-12-month revenue base of $382 billion. In other words, it takes a lot of work for Apple to drive meaningful growth. Unless there is a new game-changing product in the works, investors should probably temper their expectations.\nHowever, Apple shares are priced as if outsize growth is a certainty. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33.1. That's 55% more expensive than the trailing-10-year average. Investors remain extremely bullish.\nBased on its limited growth prospects and steep valuation, I do believe that it's too late to buy Apple stock right now. Shares aren't likely to outperform the broader Nasdaq Composite over the next few years.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Investing.com \u2013 The battle between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the title of the world's highest market capitalization has been ongoing since early January, when the iPhone maker ceded the crown to the company founded by Bill Gates, only to reclaim it on June 12. A few days later, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined the race, and with the help of artificial intelligence, managed to occupy the top spot for market cap worldwide, albeit for a single session.\nAfter all this confusion, order has been restored and as of June 21, the ranking is:\nMicrosoft: $3.312 trillion Apple: $3.215 trillion Nvidia: $3.214 trillion\nDespite the absolute gap of almost $100 billion between the first and the third, at the exorbitant levels of these three US tech giants, the difference is actually minimal, to the point that the ranking could change again from one session to the next.\nBeyond its historic and updated offering of software and digital services, one of Microsoft's strengths is that it was among the first to believe in the potential of Artificial Intelligence, heavily investing in OpenAI, a company that in the last six months has more than doubled its annualized revenue, rising to $3.4 billion from $1.6 billion at the end of 2023.\nApple's growth over the years has been long and relentless, with its stock always overcoming temporary corrections and continuing to hit new all-time highs. The Cupertino company that revolutionized the communication world with the iPhone, has become much more than a smartphone manufacturer over the years and has successfully ridden the wave of artificial intelligence by integrating it seamlessly into its iOS operating system.\nThe days when Nvidia was considered only a gaming company are long gone. Its revenues in the first quarter of 2024 rose by 265% compared to the same period last year, and its stock has soared by 170% in the last six months. In the semiconductor market, Nvidia is the absolute queen, and companies, including Microsoft and Apple, compete to secure its essential chips for training the language models that underpin generative artificial intelligence.\nIn short, all three companies have what it takes to remain where they are, but which of the three is favored at the moment?\nHere is the ranking based on the target price set by analysts:\nSource: InvestingPro\nAmong the three, analysts interviewed by InvestingPro show the most belief in Microsoft's potential. The target price is set at $480 per share, 7.7% higher than the $419.7 closing price on June 20.\nIn the case of Apple, analysts estimate a target price slightly lower by 1.5% compared to the current value.\nFinally, Nvidia could lose the most with a target price of $126.75, 3.1% less than the price on June 20.

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to unveil significant advancements at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) from June 10-14, 2024.\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant is expected to spotlight new AI-powered features across its core applications, along with updates to its operating systems, according to a recent note by Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng.\nIn a bid to simplify the login process for its users, the company reportedly plans to launch a new app called \"Passwords\" at its Worldwide Developers Conference or WWDC.\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends, too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.51%. That\u2019s a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\nSee Also: Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives Says WWDC 2024 Is \u2018Most Important Event For Apple In Over A Decade\u2019 \u2013 What To Expect\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,166,880 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $233,376 or around 1,200 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.0 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 0.7% to close at $194.48 on Thursday.\nCheck This Out: How to Find Dividend Stocks: Scan, Analyze, and Capture with Benzinga Pro \nImage: Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Ahead Of WWDC 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Title": "Apple Unveils Its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Plans. Is This a Signal to Buy the Stock?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Earlier this month, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled its long-awaited entrance into the artificial intelligence (AI) race at its Worldwide Developers Conference. As per usual, Apple has not been at the forefront of this technological shift, instead waiting patiently to jump in at the right time.\nLet's look at the announcements and some of the new features the company introduced and what this could mean for the stock.\nThe biggest announcement to come out of Apple's development conference was its introduction of Apple Intelligence, which will power generative AI features across its devices. The company also said it will set a new standard for privacy when it comes to using AI through its Private Cloud Compute.\nApple Intelligence will be in beta this fall with the currently available iPhone 15 Pro and also iPads and Macs that use M1 chips. It will be incorporated into its iOS18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia operating systems.\nAmong the AI features Apple introduced are writing tools that will let users have their words rewritten to change tone or add humor; proofread and accept corrections; and summarize documents into things like paragraphs, bullet points, or lists. Its new AI features will also prioritize emails and offer responses.\nThe company's Image Playground feature will quickly create three types of image styles -- animation, illustration, or sketch-based -- for things like themes and costumes, and it can even incorporate photos of someone from a user's photo library.\nThe feature will be available in Messages as well as third-party apps. With images, the company will also allow users to search for photos based on descriptions and offer an improved editing tool that can remove distracting objects from photos.\nApple Intelligence will work with Siri too. The company said its voice assistant will now be able to take hundreds of new actions across Apple and third-party apps. Specific examples it cited were the abilities to tell Siri to send specific photos to a friend or to find flight information.\nAnother big development to come out of Apple's conference is its partnership with OpenAI to deliver some of its new features. Apple said Siri will be able to tap into ChatGPT's expertise for queries its own AI may not be able to answer.\nAccording to reports, neither Apple nor OpenAI will benefit monetarily from their partnership. Apple is also still in talks with Alphabet and its Gemini chatbot, as well as with other chatbot creators for use in China.\nNone of the AI features Apple introduced are revolutionary. In fact, many similar features have already been introduced by others such as Microsoft and Alphabet.\nThe key for Apple, though, is it already has an enormous user base that's locked into its ecosystem, and it will be integrating AI into that ecosystem for these users. An iPhone user tends to upgrade their phone about every three years, but as improvements have become more incremental over time, the upgrade cycle has started to lengthen.\nGiven that newer devices will be needed to run the AI features, the company could see the iPhone upgrade cycle shorten again, which would help power its results. AI should also usher in new demand for apps, which can help drive increasing revenue from its App Store as well.\nApple stock has been a bit of a laggard compared to other AI-driven tech names this year with shares up about 11% year to date. However, investor optimism has picked up with its AI announcements, and the stock has jumped 13% in just the past month.\nIt currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 33, which is toward the high end of its historical average. That's despite slow revenue growth in recent quarters, so the potential impact of an AI-fueled hardware upgrade cycle looks at least partly priced in by this point.\nAs such, I'd stay on the sidelines and let some of the recent hype die down before considering Apple stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Eclipsing Apple Threatens Radical Shakeup of $67 Billion ETF",
        "Author": "  Lu Wang and Isabelle Lee ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- One of the world\u2019s biggest tech ETFs looks poised for a shake-up after Nvidia Corp. catapulted past Apple Inc. in size.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019\nSouthwest Plane Plunged Within 400 Feet of Ocean Near Hawaii\nBump Stock Ban Tossed Out by Supreme Court in Gun-Rights Win\nTesla Investors Get Behind Musk\u2019s Fight for $56 Billion Pay Deal\nApple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash\nThanks to diversification rules, the $67 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) has held way fewer Nvidia shares for months now while the AI giant continues to soar. Currently, the chipmaker makes up roughly 6% of the fund\u2019s assets, compared with 21% for the S&P 500 Information Technology Index \u2014 spurring XLK to underperform big time this year.\nNow that Nvidia has raced past Apple in value, its ownership in XLK could undergo a drastic elevation when the ETF carries out a quarterly rebalance near the end of this month, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nThe ETF will reflect the full heft of the semiconductor pioneer\u2019s capitalization \u2014 if Nvidia keeps its edge over Apple on Friday, the day when each XLK member\u2019s preliminary representation is determined. In the process, Apple\u2019s weight, currently at 21% of the fund, could drop to as little as 4.5%, thanks again to this diversification rule.\nSuch a shuffle could prompt XLK\u2019s manager, State Street Global Advisors, to load up on Nvidia shares to the tune of $10 billion, Bloomberg calculations show. Meanwhile, the fund would need to dump around $11 billion of Apple shares. That\u2019s not a petty transaction, particularly for Apple. Over the past three months, the stock has changed hands at a rate of $11 billion a day.\n\u201cIf Nvidia is larger on the reference date, they will have to flip the weights and sell Apple,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. \u201cThey will do whatever is required by the rules,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were being forced to make even larger relative sales of a stock in the past.\u201d\nA State Street spokesperson said the firm will follow any revisions as set by the index methodology. A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment on potential index changes and referred Bloomberg News to the methodology.\nIt\u2019s the latest example of how the relentless rally in tech behemoths is pushing up against the limit of regulations that date back more than 80 years. Established to protect investors following the stock market crash and the Great Depression, the diversification rules can be punishing in a lopsided market.\nAt issue is a cap on how much a stock\u2019s impact is allowed in XLK. While the fund is designed to mimic returns in the traditional S&P 500 tech sub-index over the long run, it tracks a version of the sector gauge that\u2019s kept by S&P and follows the practice of limiting member weights to avoid violating diversification rules.\nSimilar restrictions last year spurred the overseer of the Nasdaq 100 to conduct a special rebalance to keep index-tracking funds in compliance with the rules. Under those rules, the combined representation of the largest companies \u2014 those making up roughly 5% or more of a diversified fund \u2014 can\u2019t add up to more than 50%.\nWhen this rule is breached, indexes such as the Nasdaq 100 tend to trim the top holdings proportionally. XLK\u2019s methodology works differently. When a number of stocks are not in compliance, the smallest of those gets clipped.\nIn the previous two quarterly rebalances, Nvidia\u2019s weight in XLK was cut to 4.5% each time because its value trailed Microsoft Corp. and Apple, and was therefore more exposed to a reduction. That happened even as the chipmaker made up 17% of the regular S&P 500 tech index in March and 11% in December.\nAs a result, XLK suffered from not owning enough Nvidia, with the latter surging around 145% year-to-date amid the AI frenzy. The ETF has lagged behind the traditional S&P 500 tech gauge by 4.5 percentage points this quarter \u2014 on track for the widest dispersion since 2001.\nIn the event that a switch does happen, Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, is more focused at the implications on how XLK may fit in an investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\u201cThe potential switch of sizing up of Nvidia and sizing down of Apple would make a very significant characteristic change to XLK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have an ETF that is more semis-oriented and more momentum-orientated. It is changing the characteristic, which means it may change the way the ETF trades.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGrieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon\nIsraeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War\nThe World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\nHow to Cool Down Parks in Hot Cities\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the Best AI Stock After WWDC AI Announcements?",
        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market\u2019s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI. \u00a0SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank\u2019s CFO, who said the bank\u2019s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a \u201cbreak from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.\u201d\nIn this backdrop it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what\u2019s happening in the AI space.\nIn this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can\u2019t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nCopyright: dennizn / 123RF Stock Photo\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are trending as the company announced a slew of AI products and features at its much-awaited WWDC conference.\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives also thinks Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will be able to create an ecosystem around its AI offerings and Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0would see a $30 to $40 per share surge because of its AI products. Ives has a $275 price target on Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0shares.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 9.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But if Apple can really execute its AI strategy well, the company can become the next favorite AI stock of the Street.\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\u201cConsumers may find purchasing Microsoft\u2019s AI PC confusing (calculating whether it reaches 40 TOPS before purchase), whereas Apple directly tells consumers which models can support Apple Intelligence. Regardless of whether on-device AI applications meet consumer needs, Apple has a clear selling advantage from the start,\u201d Kuo said.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company\u2019s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company\u2019s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  GlobalData ",
        "Text": "US technology giant Apple has been accused of underpaying its female employees in California in comparison with men in similar roles.\nMore than 12,000 female employees in the engineering, marketing and AppleCare divisions are paid less than their male equivalents, the lawsuit filed in a state court in San Francisco has revealed.\nThe plaintiffs, two women with more than a decade of experience at Apple, claim the company's pay practices are biased against female workers.\nClass action law firms Outten & Golden, Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, and Altshuler Berzon are backing the plaintiffs.\nThe lawsuit, which is seeking unspecified damages and penalties, accused Apple of violating California\u2019s Equal Pay Act and Fair Employment and Housing Act.\nThe complaint suggests that Apple's method of determining starting pay, which is based on previous salaries or \"pay expectations,\" contributes to lower pay rates for women.\nThe lawsuit points out that despite California\u2019s ban on salary history inquiries since 2018, Apple\u2019s reliance on pay expectations effectively perpetuates wage disparities.\nThe plaintiffs also argue that Apple's \"talent\" designation, which often results in higher pay, is disproportionately awarded to men.\nThe lawsuit criticises Apple's performance evaluation system, alleging it is skewed against women when determining raises and bonuses.\nEve Cervantez, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs and a partner at Altshuler Berzon, said that Apple's practices exacerbate the gender pay gap.\nCervantez stated: \u201cThis is a no-win situation for female employees at Apple. Once women are hired into a lower pay range at Apple, subsequent pay raises or any bonuses are tracked accordingly, meaning they don\u2019t correct the gender pay gap. Instead, they perpetuate and widen the gap because raises and bonuses are based on a percentage of the employee\u2019s base salary.\u201d\nApple, headquartered in Cupertino, California, has responded by asserting its commitment to inclusion and pay equity.\nThe company's statement, quoted by Reuters, read: \"Since 2017, Apple has achieved and maintained gender pay equity and every year we partner with an independent third-party expert to examine each team member\u2019s total compensation and make adjustments, where necessary, to ensure that we maintain pay equity.\"\n\"Apple faces gender pay gap lawsuit in California, US\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Perhaps no two tech-oriented, consumer product companies are ingrained in U.S. consumers' everyday lives as much as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\nAmazon is the leader of e-commerce, controlling a nearly 38% market share in the U.S. It's next closest competitor is Walmart, which has a less than 7% market share.\nApple, meanwhile, is estimated to hold a more than 59% market share in the smartphone market in the U.S.; Samsung is a distant second at 23%.\nWhile both companies have dominant market positions in the U.S. in their respective fields, the question is which stock is the better buy at the moment?\nAmazon has been solidly outperforming Apple on the revenue growth front the past few quarters. The e-commerce giant has been able to grow its revenue by double digits each of the past four quarters, including by 13% last quarter to $143.3 billion.\nApple, on the other hand, has been struggling with growth. The company has only seen its revenue increase once in the past four quarters, a scant 2% gain in its December quarter. Last quarter, meanwhile, revenue fell 4% to $90.8 billion. The company has been hampered by struggling iPhone sales in China and a lengthening replacement cycle.\nBoth companies are looking toward artificial intelligence (AI) to help spur growth.\nWhile not growing as quickly as its two main cloud computing competitors, Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment is still showing solid revenue growth, up 17% last quarter. The company plans to increase capital expenditures to expand its data center operations in order to meet the increasing demand for generative AI. The company believes this upfront investment will lead to strong free cash flow and better operating margins down the road.\nThe company is also helping customers build out their own AI solutions through its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms. With BedRock, the company is providing foundational large language models (LLMs) from both itself and AI start-ups, while SageMaker helps customers create their own AI models.\nApple, meanwhile, has just jumped into the AI race with a number of AI features that will be powered by its Apple Intelligence solution. Apple Intelligence will be incorporated into its latest operating systems and be able to be used within its own and third-party apps while maintaining user privacy. It will also be added to its voice assistant, Siri, to help with various tasks such as finding a specific photo or hotel booking information.\nThe big hope for Apple is that the new AI features will help spur a hardware upgrade cycle, as later versions of its devices are generally needed to run these AI-related functions. The company has seen upgrade cycles start to lengthen, so these new features and future AI capabilities could spur people to more quickly upgrade their smartphones and computers.\nApple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 33, lower than Amazon's forward P/E of over 40.\nHowever, Amazon has been growing its revenue at a much faster clip than Apple, which has struggled to grow its revenue over the past 12 months. Amazon has also been seeing more earnings growth, as the company leverages fixed costs to grow its bottom line.\nBoth companies have solid balance sheets. Amazon carries about $8 billion in net cash, while Apple has a whopping $68.6 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Apple's large cash position and prolific free cash flow give it a lot of flexibility to buy back shares, and the company recently announced an additional $110 billion share repurchase program.\nAmazon and Apple have proven to be two of the most successful companies in the world, and both should be long-term winners for investors. If I had to choose only one, I'd pick Amazon at this time given its higher growth. The company has also shown a willingness to spend a lot of cash in order to win in the past, and combined with the potential of AI, I think this will be a winning strategy.\nHowever, considering the potential of a hardware upgrade cycle due to AI, a cheaper valuation, and a boatload of cash, I wouldn't just toss Apple aside. Fortunately, investors can own both of these solid stocks if they choose.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Samsung SDI (KS:006400), which supplies batteries to Apple, added 0.5%.\nIn Taiwan, TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM)- the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier- rose 2%, while Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) (Foxconn), which assembles iPhones and other devices for Apple, added 0.4%. Both stocks were sitting on strong gains this week.\nIn China, AAC Technologies (OTC:AACAY) Holdings Inc (HK:2018), which makes acoustic components for Apple, rose 2%, while BYD Co (HK:1211), which also supplies battery technology to Apple, rallied nearly 8%.\nApple\u2019s AI plans were welcomed by investors, who bet that introduction of new features, such as increased voice command functionality and photo editing capabilities will help shore up slowing iPhone sales. Given that a bulk of the new AI features are only compatible with newer iPhone models, their introduction could potentially spark a new upgrade cycle among customers.\nAI is also expected to further Apple\u2019s software services, revenue from which has so far remained robust despite laggard device sales.\nRelated Articles\nApple\u2019s AI spike sparks rally in Asian suppliers\nTesla shareholders voting yes for Musk's $56 billion pay package, CEO says on X\nWhite House to nominate Goldsmith Romero soon, aiming for July hearing - source\n"

        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:\nJPMorgan upgraded Adobe (ADBE) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $580, up from $570, following last night's results. Over the last four years, Adobe shares have been fairly flattish, but there is now \"smoother sailing ahead\" on new product and pricing tailwinds as well as generative artificial intelligence monetization, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nErste Group upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy from Hold, saying the company benefits from a very high level of customer loyalty.\nKeefe Bruyette upgraded Bank of America (BAC) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $46, up from $37. Bank of America offers \"strong: capital, deposits and credit, but the main driver of the upgrade is an expected inflection in the bank's Q4 net interest income 5% above Q2, driven by back book repricing and improved commercial and industrial yields, the analyst says.\nEvercore ISI upgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Outperform from In Line with a $75 price target. The recent pullback in the stock has created an attractive entry point to own a \"best-in-class\" e-commerce platform business, Evercore says.\nUBS upgraded Permian Resources (PR) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $21, up from $20. The analyst sees two positive catalysts in the second half of 2024 to drive shares higher: upside to fiscal UBS's 2024 oil production forecast, driven by improved operations, along with an increase to the $225M synergies from the Earthstone Energy acquisition.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Twilio (TWLO) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $60, down from $70. The analyst cites a lack of next 12 months sales catalysts and the majority of the company's of near-term operating leverage having been achieved for the downgrade.\nPiper Sandler downgraded Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $11.50, down from $13.50. While Piper has no concerns on \"major issues\" such as risk or capital, it feels the stock is in for a period of underperformance following a stronger start to the year.\nErste Group downgraded Intuit (INTU) to Hold from Buy, saying the majority of the company's customers are smaller companies and self-employed persons, where competitive pressure represents a long-term risk.\nMonness Crespi downgraded Datadog (DDOG) to Sell from Neutral with a $98 price target. Datadog's valuation \"was already rich, and this month's rally further exacerbated the excess,\" argues the analyst, who believes the market \"will not support software stocks with excessive valuations.\"\nEvercore ISI downgraded APA Corp. (APA) to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $39, down from $52. Filling a near-term portfolio gap via an acquisition while Egypt has disappointed and the North Sea is likely more an ongoing question of liability management has created little incremental value, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nMacquarie initiated coverage of Roblox (RBLX) with an Outperform rating and $46 price target. Roblox is a highly scaled gaming platform poised to deliver a double-digit revenue growth over the next three years, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nBernstein last night initiated coverage last night of MicroStrategy (MSTR) with an Overweight rating and $2,890 price target, which represents 80% upside. The company has transformed from a small software company to the largest bitcoin holding company, owning 1.1% of world's bitcoin supply worth $14.5B, according to the analyst.\nBofA reinstated coverage of ConocoPhillips (COP) with a Buy rating and $147 price target. The current M&A cycle has reshaped the competitive landscape in U.S. E&P to the benefit of names with size and growth, says BofA.\nErste Group reinstated coverage of Arista Networks (ANET) with a Buy rating following a period of under review. Erste says Arista is on its way to creating a cross-vendor ecosystem that enables control and coordination between artificial intelligence networks and AI computing infrastructure.\nBofA reinstated coverage of Five Below (FIVE) with a Neutral rating and $125 price target. The firm models a low double-digit sales compound annual growth rate driven by store growth, but thinks the current comparable store sales weakness is \"more than just a macro issue,\" the analyst tells investors.\n"

        "Text": "iPadOS 18 takes iPad to the next level with Apple Intelligence, the introduction of Calculator with Math Notes, new handwriting tools in Notes, additional ways to customize iPad, and more\nCUPERTINO, Calif., June 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today previewed iPadOS\u00ae 18, a major release that enhances the iPad\u00ae experience, making it more versatile and intelligent than ever. With iPadOS 18, Calculator comes to iPad with Math Notes, along with new handwriting tools in Notes \u2014 all designed for Apple Pencil\u00ae. iPad users now have more ways to customize the Home Screen and Control Center, and with iPadOS 18, users receive the biggest redesign of the Photos app to date and new ways to express themselves in Messages.\niPadOS 18 also introduces Apple Intelligence\u2122, the personal intelligence system for iPhone\u00ae, iPad, and Mac\u00ae that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that\u2019s incredibly useful and relevant. Built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iPadOS 18, iOS 18, and macOS\u00ae Sequoia. It understands and creates language and images, takes action across apps, and draws from personal context, simplifying and accelerating everyday tasks. Taking full advantage of the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine, Apple Intelligence will be supported on iPad models with an M-series chip.1\n\"Our most versatile device is becoming even more powerful and intelligent than ever with iPadOS 18,\" said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Software Engineering. \"With fun new ways to personalize the Home Screen, a redesigned Photos experience, major updates to the Notes app, the addition of Calculator with Math Notes, and the groundbreaking introduction of Apple Intelligence, iPadOS 18 brings incredible new features designed for the unique capabilities of iPad, making it even easier for users to get tasks done.\"\nCalculator on iPad Delivers a New Way to Solve with Math Notes\nAn all-new Math Notes calculator allows users to type or write out mathematical expressions and see them instantly solved in their own handwriting. They can also assign values to variables when learning new concepts in class, calculating a budget, and more. With a new graphing feature, users can write or type an equation and insert a graph with just one tap, and can even add multiple equations on the same graph to see how they relate. And Math Notes are automatically accessible in the Notes app in the new Math Notes folder.\nThe basic and scientific calculators on iPad make it easy to view complete expressions before completing them. History helps users keep track of previous calculations, and unit conversions let users quickly convert length, weight, currencies, and more.\nMore Flexible Handwritten Notes with Smart Script\nWith the power of Apple Pencil, Smart Script makes handwritten notes fluid, flexible, and easier to read, all while maintaining the look and feel of a user\u2019s personal handwriting. Smart Script allows users to write quickly without sacrificing legibility by smoothing and straightening handwritten text in real time. And it makes editing handwritten text just as simple as editing typed text. With Apple Pencil, users can easily add space, scratch out a sentence, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting, and the paragraph will automatically reflow to fit the new content.\nThe Notes app brings enhancements to typed text, too. For added convenience, users can now organize the content of their notes by collapsing sections under headings or subheadings. And for information that needs to stand out, they can choose from five new text highlight colors.\nMore Ways to Customize iPad\niPadOS 18 introduces even more options for users to express themselves, including brand-new ways to customize the Home Screen and app icons as well as Control Center. App icons and widgets can be placed in any open position on the Home Screen to create the ideal layout and let a user\u2019s wallpaper shine through. They can be customized to appear exactly how users want \u2014 light, dark, or with a tint. Users can also make all the app icons and widgets appear even larger, removing the name underneath, for a new streamlined look.\nControl Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, and it gets new levels of customization and flexibility. The redesign delivers quick access to new groups of a user\u2019s most-utilized controls, such as media playback, Home controls, and connectivity, as well as the ability to easily swipe between each. Users can now add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center all from one place. Developers can take advantage of the new Controls API to let their users accomplish even more tasks, like quickly unlocking a vehicle or instantly capturing content for social media.\nA New Tab Bar Brings Easier Navigation\nA redesigned tab bar floats above app content and complements the sidebar to help users stay focused on what matters most while keeping favorite tabs within reach. The new floating tab bar elegantly morphs into the sidebar so users can dive deeper into an app\u2019s full functionality. With the redesigned tab bar, iPad users can reorder or add other tabs from the sidebar, unlocking an entirely new way to customize in-app experiences.\nA Redesigned Photos App to Relive Special Moments\nThe Photos app receives its biggest redesign yet \u2014 which takes advantage of the larger display on iPad \u2014 automatically keeping libraries organized so users can spend less time searching and more time enjoying their best moments. A simplified, single view displays a familiar grid, and new collections help users browse by themes without having to organize content into albums. Plus, collections can be pinned to keep favorites easily accessible. A new carousel view presents highlights that update each day and feature favorite people, pets, places, and more. Autoplaying content throughout the app brings libraries to life, so past moments can be enjoyed while browsing. Because each user\u2019s photo library is unique, the app is customizable, so users can organize collections, pin collections to access frequently, and include what\u2019s most important to them in the carousel view.\nNew Ways to Stay Connected in Messages\nMessages receives big updates to the ways users express themselves and stay connected. Text formatting like bold, underline, italics, and all-new animated text effects bring iMessage\u00ae conversations to life, and with redesigned Tapbacks, users can react to a message with any emoji or sticker. Messages in iPadOS 18 introduces the ability to schedule messages to send at a later time, helping users stay fully in control of when and how they are connecting with their closest contacts.\nSafari Enables Distraction-Free Browsing\nSafari\u00ae, the world\u2019s fastest browser,2 now offers an even easier way to discover information on the web with Highlights and a redesigned Reader experience. Using machine learning, Safari can surface key information about a webpage. For example, users can review a summary to get the gist of an article; quickly see the location of a restaurant, hotel, or landmark; or listen to an artist\u2019s track right from an article about the song or album. Additionally, with a redesigned Reader view, there are even more ways to enjoy a streamlined presentation of an article and its summary.\nNew Privacy Controls\niPadOS 18 gives users even more ways to control who can see their apps, how they share their contacts, and how their iPad connects to accessories. Locked and hidden apps offer users peace of mind that information they want to keep private, such as app notifications and content, will not inadvertently be seen by others. Users can now lock an app; and for additional privacy, they can hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder. When an app is locked or hidden, content like messages or emails inside the app are hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the system.\nUsers also have more control in managing how apps access their information. When an app requires access to contact information, users can now allow access to specific contacts, not the full contact list. To keep other connections on the network private, developers can now seamlessly pair Bluetooth accessories without relying on other accessories nearby.\nApple Intelligence Makes iPad Even More Useful and Delightful\nDeeply integrated into iPadOS 18 and built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new, systemwide Writing Tools built into iPadOS 18, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages\u00ae, and third-party apps.\nNew image capabilities make communication and self-expression even more fun. With Image Playground, users can create playful images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Image Playground is easy to use, built right into apps like Messages, and also available in a dedicated app. In Notes, users can access Image Playground through the new Image Wand in the Apple Pencil tool palette, making notes even more visually engaging.\nMemories in Photos lets users create the stories they want to see just by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. In addition, a new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo \u2014 without accidentally altering the subject.\nWith the power of Apple Intelligence, Siri\u00ae takes a major step forward, becoming even more natural, contextually relevant, and personal. Additionally, users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment.\nWith Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers. When requests are routed to Private Cloud Compute, data is not stored or made accessible to Apple and is only used to fulfill the user\u2019s requests, and independent experts can verify this privacy promise.\nAdditionally, access to ChatGPT is integrated into Siri and systemwide Writing Tools across Apple\u2019s platforms, allowing users to access its expertise \u2014 as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities \u2014 without needing to jump between tools.\nAdditional iPadOS 18 updates include:\nBuilt on the foundation of Keychain\u00ae, Passwords is a new app that makes it easy to access credentials and have them securely stored in one place, including passwords, verification codes, and security alerts.\nSharePlay\u2122 gets even better this year with powerful updates to screen sharing. Users can tap and draw on their screen to point out what should be done. And for more direct assistance, users can ask for permission to remotely control a device.\nWith Freeform\u00ae, bringing ideas to life becomes even easier. Users can create scenes to organize sections of a board by topic, or easily present content by moving around quickly.\nGaming becomes even more immersive with features like Game Mode and Personalized Spatial Audio, which put players in the middle of the action in upcoming titles like Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows and RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard. And with Game Porting Toolkit 2, developers have new tools that make it easier to bring even more advanced games to iPad, iPhone, and Mac.\nCalendar becomes more helpful by showing both events and tasks from Reminders. Users can create, edit, and complete reminders right from Calendar.\nReminders gets new tools, including the ability to view, create, and edit directly from the Calendar app; access a recently deleted list; and find subtasks in Smart Lists for quick reference.\nIn Apple Maps, users can browse thousands of hikes across national parks in the United States and easily create their own custom walking routes, which they can access offline. Maps users can also save their favorite national park hikes, custom walking routes, and locations to an all-new Places Library and add personal notes about each spot.\nAccessibility features include Eye Tracking, a built-in option for navigating iPad with just eyes, and Vocal Shortcuts that enable users to perform tasks by making a custom sound.\nAvailability\nThe developer beta of iPadOS 18 is available through the Apple Developer Program at developer.apple.com starting today, and a public beta will be available through the Apple Beta Software Program next month at beta.apple.com. New software features will be available this fall as a free software update for iPad Pro (M4), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later), iPad Air (M2), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (7th generation and later), and iPad mini (5th generation and later).

        "Title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Still a Golden Opportunity after WWDC Event",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "There was a lot of excitement and high hopes for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it strolled into its annual worldwide developers conference (WWDC) this year. Undoubtedly, WWDC was supposedly the most important event of the year for the Cupertino-based tech titan. Despite the initial disappointment as visualized in AAPL stock, which fell 2% yesterday, I still think the stock is attractive for long-term investors willing to give Apple a chance to build upon the strong AI foundation it\u2019s laying out for developers this week.\nIn traditional Apple fashion, Tim Cook and company left the best (the reveal of its AI offering called Apple Intelligence) of the WWDC event for last. This, unfortunately, caused shares of AAPL to sink to their lowest point of the day before more than recovering today.\nDo you remember the last time an Apple event actually moved AAPL stock higher initially? Neither do I. Perhaps Apple\u2019s keynote team needs to spruce things up by letting Siri present her own new features or allowing the great Sam Altman to take the stage for a moment. Either way, I wouldn\u2019t dismiss Apple\u2019s lack of putting on a needle-moving show as a reason to shy away from the stock, even as many less-than-bullish talking heads express their lack of enthusiasm about the event and the path forward.\nFurther, some bears may double down on their concern that Apple is still falling behind in the AI race, even with the AI-packed punch of WWDC 2024. Despite the negativity, there were underrated developments from WWDC that may pave the way for upside in the coming 18 months.\nThe WWDC event saw a great deal of new AI features embedded across iOS, macOS, and even visionOS for the new Vision Pro (normal images converted to spatial images via AI). On the whole, though, the event really didn\u2019t include anything that wasn\u2019t already known via reports and rumors before the event kicked off.\nThe stock\u2019s initial negative reaction wasn\u2019t so much about a lack of AI features as much as it was about a lack of anything surprising that stood to \u201cbreak new ground,\u201d a phrase Tim Cook previously used at a prior conference call to describe Apple\u2019s AI ambitions.\nArguably, the OpenAI partnership to bring ChatGPT to the Apple ecosystem was the biggest announcement of WWDC\u2019s opening keynote. That said, many investors and traders saw the collaboration coming from a mile away.\nHeck, it was common knowledge that Apple was teaming up with OpenAI in the weeks leading up to WWDC, and the stock had already reacted by rallying to almost $197 per share, just shy of all-time highs. Simply put, the main attraction of the day was already well baked into the stock in the morning before WWDC began.\nThough the company delivered us a big dose of AI (Apple Intelligence as opposed to artificial intelligence) along with a wide range of impressive new innovations on the software side, AAPL stock seemed to only gravitate lower the further we moved through the event. The crowd was tough, perhaps too tough, especially given the distinct advantages Apple confirmed in the latter half of the keynote.\nSpecifically, Apple\u2019s privacy and personalization advantages, I believe, are being severely discounted by investors and some analysts.\nApple has been all about privacy when it comes to its products and services well before ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom. The strong privacy stance seemed mostly like good marketing in the earlier days when privacy concerns surrounded Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In the age of AI, though, such a privacy-first focus, I believe, puts Apple at or around the top when it comes to consumer-facing AI. In an era of AI model commoditization, standing out with an edge is key to winning the AI race.\nThough AI-savvy rivals, like Meta, may have more impressive AI chops than Apple right now, I\u2019m not so sure Meta can convince us it has user privacy at the forefront. Even if Meta can convince us to trust it with our most intimate data, Apple is already in the pockets and on the desktops of well over a billion users. These users trust Apple enough with a slew of data they wouldn\u2019t dare enter into the prompt of just any chatbot.\nWhen it comes to AI, privacy and personalization go hand-in-hand. While Apple\u2019s rivals may have fancier language or diffusion models (for text and image generators, respectively), Apple seems to have the infrastructure in place to allow users to harness the power of AI without putting their data at risk.\nIndeed, the OpenAI ChatGPT partnership may be the biggest move for Apple into AI to date. However, I\u2019d argue that Apple\u2019s privacy-focused infrastructure is an even more significant advancement, one that I believe puts Apple ahead of the pack in AI. Sure, such a statement may seem outlandish today, but would you trust just any company with your personal photos, calendar, notes, messages, web history, and more? Probably not.\nIn a few years, I view Apple Intelligence as setting the new standard for personalized AI, with models running safely and swiftly on devices. If more firepower is needed to undertake a query, a secure encrypted connection to Apple\u2019s private cloud infrastructure will be established transparently via Private Cloud Compute.\nIf you\u2019re like me and think Apple is setting a new standard on AI, the stock\u2019s current 31.9 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is still too low. Sure, it\u2019s on the high side of the historical range, with AAPL stock averaging a 24.9 times trailing P/E in the past five years.\nHowever, when was the last time Apple gave its unique take on a profound and revolutionary industry on AI? Doubt Apple\u2019s take on AI, if you will, but I think it was everything in place to win over consumers with its privacy focus and massive advantage in personalized AI.\nAlso, dismiss AAPL stock for the 10% drop in iPhone revenues in Q2 2024, if you will. Still, my bet is that an iPhone supercycle could be on the way after consumers have a chance to try Apple Intelligence for themselves later this year once iOS 18 launches.\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 34 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target\u00a0is $208.35, implying upside potential of 1.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $164.00 per share to a high of $275.00 per share.\nAAPL stock still seems attractive for investors willing to give the firm a few years to keep adding to what I believe is a profoundly strong AI foundation. With a privacy-first edge and cloud services to power its AI models of the future, I see Apple not just catching up in the AI race but taking steps to pull ahead of most other rivals. Additionally, Apple is setting a new standard for how consumer-facing AI models run.\nWho knows? Perhaps we\u2019ll all refer to AI as Apple Intelligence in 10-15 years.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "How Apple's AI Update Was Bad News for Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The wait is over. There was considerable anticipation leading up to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this week. In particular, investors were eager to learn about Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. They now have some answers.\nAt Alphabet's Google Cloud Next event in April, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was near the center of attention. It was a much different story at Apple's WWDC. Here's how Apple's AI update was bad news for Nvidia.\nApple and Nvidia have been neck-and-neck in claiming the No. 2 spot behind Microsoft among the largest companies based on market cap. In the aftermath of the WWDC, Apple has opened up a bigger lead over Nvidia.\nI think one major story from this week's WWDC is that Apple is committed to winning in the edge AI market. Edge AI is the deployment of AI on connected devices at the \"edge\" of networks.\nApple Intelligence (the name for Apple's generative AI integration with its newest iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems) represents a key step forward for Apple in edge AI. CEO Tim Cook said, \"Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user's personal context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. And it can access that information in a completely private and secure way to help users do the things that matter most to them.\"\nApple's version of generative AI will primarily run on its devices rather than in the cloud. Where is Nvidia's tremendous growth coming from these days? Primarily from selling GPUs for use in cloud data centers. Sure, Nvidia offers solutions for edge AI. However, it isn't anywhere in the picture with Apple's strategy. And Apple's more than 2.2 billion devices worldwide could put it in the driver's seat in the edge AI market.\nDidn't Apple reveal that some of Apple Intelligence will run on the cloud? Yep. However, that won't help Nvidia.\nThere were two words in Apple's update that Nvidia almost certainly didn't want to hear: \"Apple silicon.\" Apple said its Private Cloud Compute for handling more complex requests will \"run on servers powered by Apple silicon.\"\nThat's a stark contrast to other leading cloud services. Amazon Web Services uses Nvidia's GPUs. So do Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. But Apple won't.\nIt's even possible that Amazon, Microsoft, and Google could be inspired by Apple's decision to use its own silicon to accelerate their own internal chip programs. All three major cloud service providers have their own AI chips but still rely primarily on Nvidia's GPUs.\nNvidia would have undoubtedly loved for Apple to have used its GPUs in its Private Cloud Compute. That would have reinforced the view of Nvidia as the undisputed leader in AI chips for data centers. Nvidia would have also probably preferred that more of Apple's generative AI functionality run in the cloud instead of on the devices.\nNeither happened. That's bad news in one sense for Nvidia. However, it's not horrible news by any stretch of the imagination despite Nvidia's shares falling a little this week.\nApple's AI approach shouldn't diminish the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia's GPUs.

        "Text": "Watch These Key Stock Price Levels in Each Tech Behemoth\nMarlena Sloss / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAs Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple jostle for the mantle of the world\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalization, watch out for these key chart levels.\nMonitor if buyers can defend an uptrend line in Nvidia shares around $87 during periods of profit taking.\nA breakdown below a key uptrend line in Microsoft shares could act as a catalyst for a decline to two prior record highs around $350.\nThe measuring principle projects a price target in Apple shares of $228 following the stock's breakout from a channel pattern.\n\nAs Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) continue to jostle for the mantle of the world\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalization, we take a look at the weekly chart of each tech behemoth and use technical analysis to identify important chart levels to watch out for.\nSince bottoming out just below the 200-day moving average (MA) in October last year, Nvidia shares have continued to trend sharply higher, with investors promptly buying any minor dips. In saying that, the stock appears stretched to the upside, given it trades around 56% above a multi-month uptrend line and the relative strength index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions with a reading over the 70 threshold.\nDuring periods of profit-taking, monitor if buyers can defend the uptrend line, currently sitting at around $87. A breakdown below this level could see the shares test the top of a prior consolidation area near $50.\nSimilar to Nvidia, Microsoft shares have continued to trend strongly upwards since finding support around the 200-day MA in October last year. However, a key difference is that the Microsoft chart indicate less overbought conditions. The price trades within close proximity to an uptrend line extending back to the October low, with the RSI indicator giving a reading below 70. Although the lower RSI suggests the shares have room to move higher it also indicates the stock has less momentum than Nvidia.\nLooking ahead, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on how price responds to the uptrend line. A failure to hold this key technical indicator could act as a catalyst for a decline to two prior record highs in the stock around $350.\nApple shares traded within a narrow 12-month channel before staging a volume-backed breakout earlier this month after unveiling Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker\u2019s personalized artificial intelligence (AI) to be installed on its devices. Although, the RSI indicator has recently moved into overbought territory, the stock has ample room to continue moving higher given its extended consolidation before the breakout.\nInvestors can project a potential price target using the measuring principle. To do this, calculate the distance between the channel\u2019s lower and upper trendlines and add that amount to the breakout point. For example, adding $31 to the $197 breakout point forecasts a price target of $228.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett\u2019s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 150\nOne of the largest technology companies in the world, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs no introduction. However, its place at the top of the tech market value chain has been in a constant state of flux in 2024, which also shows the changing trends on Wall Street and in the technology industry. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the biggest companies in terms of revenue, but its shares remained lackluster in 2024 before a slew of AI announcements at its WWDC conference. Before the AI announcements, the shares had gained a mere 4% in the year, but since then, the stock is up by more than 8%. While AI might have injected fresh life into Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares, another key determinant of its future is iPhone sales performance.\nThe iPhone is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s largest product in terms of revenue, and the shares have been lackluster as investors have been worried about slowing growth in China. These concerns were also on the mind of Aristotle Atlantic Partners, whose Q1 2024 investor letter (shared before WWDC) outlined:\nApple contributed to portfolio performance in the first quarter due to the strategy\u2019s underweight relative to the benchmark. Investors continue to be concerned about weak handset sales globally, as well as declining market share and competitive dynamics in the Chinese market, as Huawei has returned to the market with a more competitive premium-priced handset. Apple has yet to demonstrate a competitive AI product, which could present further competitive headwinds for the company.\nOverall AAPL ranks 8th on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA\u00a0and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

They estimate that even a one-month reduction in the typical upgrade cycle could result in an additional $14 billion in iPhone sales, representing a 7% increase over current FY25 expectations.\nEvercore highlights Apple's staggered rollout of AI features, with some functionality delayed until later in the calendar year 2025 (CY25). They argue that this will extend the upgrade cycle as positive word-of-mouth and new features continue to emerge.\nBased on this, Evercore is raising its FY25 iPhone revenue growth estimate from 4% to 7%, with the potential for growth to reach double digits.

        "Author": "  Michael del Castillo ",
        "Text": "Apple on Tuesday revealed a new way for customers to take out loans. Buried deep in a press release on new software products available this fall, the Cupertino-based firm shared that users in the U.S. will be able to \u201capply for loans directly through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay.\u201d Affirm Holdings, a San Francisco\u2013based fintech that lets users spread out payments over months without incurring late fees or interest\u2014a process called \u201cbuy now, pay later,\u201d or BNPL\u2014confirmed the deal in investor documents.\nAffirm\u2019s stock jumped 11% on Tuesday to a high of $33.98, still well below its $52.48 peak over the past year. Since then, the stock reached a high of $38.16 and was trading near $36 at the time of publication.\nWhat\u2019s interesting about the partnership is Apple already has a bank providing very similar services: Goldman Sachs. But multiple reports that cite people with knowledge of the matter have said the relationship is on the rocks\u2014and could be on ice by this fall. Though Apple didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on whether the deal with Goldman would continue, it did confirm the Affirm deal won\u2019t change those plans, whatever they are. Goldman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. But multiple analysts who spoke to Fortune are operating under the assumption the deal is off\u2014or soon will be.\nBy all outward appearances, the Affirm partnership looks like a great replacement for Goldman\u2019s BNPL offering, according to Gil Luria, managing director at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson. After all, U.S. regulators said last month they would treat BNPL the same as credit cards. While fintechs like Affirm may not replace banks in the eyes of users, they, and the network of smaller, mostly state banks that support them, could someday soon compete with the largest banks in the world.\n\u201cFrom a regulatory perspective, and really from an intellectual perspective, there's not a lot of difference between a credit card product and a \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 product,\u201d says Luria. \u201cIn terms of the consumer perception, they are different products. And so it\u2019s hard to imagine that Apple will not have a credit card offering as part of its Apple wallet, even if it is providing a consumer credit through another type of product.\u201d\nPayPal cofounder Max Levchin launched Affirm in March 2012 to build new kinds of payment products enabled by the internet. Almost right out of the gate, it competed against Apple. In October 2014, Apple launched Apple Pay enabling customers to use their iPhones to pay with credit cards issued by Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, Citi, and Wells Fargo.\nIn the fall of 2016, Affirm launched a service that let people choose how they wanted to pay for goods, which morphed into what is now known as BNPL. Apple countered three years later by joining forces with Goldman Sachs to offer an almost identical product. The offering was so similar that when Apple last year made it available in the U.S., Reuters described the event as threatening to fintechs like Affirm.\nWhile both Affirm\u2019s and Apple\u2019s services sound an awful lot like a credit card minus the card, neither was regulated as such.\nThough Apple doesn\u2019t charge user fees, most BNPL companies make money through some combination of fees to users and merchants. Apple doesn\u2019t break down its BNPL revenue, but Fortune Business Insights estimates the total market was $30 billion last year. Despite the promising revenue stream, just eight months after the Goldman partnership was publicized, Apple reportedly gave the investment bank a plan whereby the deal could be unwound by as early as November.\nEnter Affirm. The same day Affirm publicized the partnership, the company\u2019s site elaborated: \u201cLater this year, eligible U.S. customers checking out online or in-app with Apple Pay on iPhone and iPad will be able to apply to pay over time with Affirm for eligible transactions.\u201d\nTo help fulfill customer loans, Affirm works with FDIC-insured, state-chartered private banks like Cross River Bank, from New Jersey, Celtic Bank from Utah, and Lead Bank from Missouri. In April, Memphis-based Evolve Bank & Trust, which issues the Affirm credit card, had customer funds associated with pig-butchering scams seized. It also provided banking services for fintech Synapse, which went bankrupt in May. Evolve did not respond to a request for comment.\nThat same month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent U.S. government agency regulating the financial sector, determined that BNPL lenders are credit card providers and \u201cmust provide consumers some key legal protections and rights that apply to conventional credit cards.\u201d While the additional costs of complying with the regulation will likely eat into Affirm\u2019s bottom line, a written response from the company said the decision \u201caligned with responsibly extending access to credit.\u201d\nThough regulators now view credit cards and BNPL as the same thing, Luria says the perception that they are different will likely lead Apple to seek a new, more traditional banking partner\u2014should the Goldman deal officially dissolve: \u201cIt\u2019s very safe to assume that Apple will not have a hard time finding a replacement.\u201d\nIf the Goldman deal does evaporate, there are dozens of potential candidates to replace it, including Providence-based Citizens Bank. Nationally chartered, Citizens is one of the few publicly traded banks working with Apple. Since 2014, it\u2019s been letting its users prove their identity using the iPhone\u2019s fingerprint technology and provides financing for customers who want to upgrade phones. Citizens has $222 billion in assets. A bank representative says that contrary to other reports, the services are neither a credit card nor BNPL, and the Affirm deal won\u2019t impact the firm\u2019s work. \u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate any changes,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nState-chartered Green Dot Bank has $5.3 billion in assets and provides banking services for Apple Cash, which lets users send each other money. A Green Dot representative also confirms the relationship will continue unchanged.\nApple\u2019s having so many banking partners makes sense, according to Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. Ives says the increasingly competitive series of financial products offered by Apple is likely intentional\u2014it\u2019s designed to more efficiently capitalize on the iPhone\u2019s estimated 1 billion users.\n\u201cApple has many partnerships, and they do not bet solely on one partner,\u201d says Ives. \u201cThis a smart move by Cupertino in this space: Bet on the winners, and one will emerge.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Further, 45% of IT professionals agree that increased automation would allow their company to get more from investment in Apple devices.\nAssignment Maps automates the assignment of settings and apps to Apple devices, empowering IT teams with confidence that the configurations they want to deploy are being implemented while also freeing them up to focus on core business initiatives.\n\u201cWith the introduction of Assignment Maps, we\u2019re building upon our best-in-class Blueprints and driving efficiency for IT and InfoSec teams with automation, logic, and flexibility,\u201d said Weldon Dodd, Senior Vice President for Global Solutions at Kandji. \u201cCustomers\u2014from large enterprises to small and medium businesses\u2014will discover new, intuitive ways to architect outcomes that were previously unattainable. This innovation strengthens our position as a powerful solution for managing Apple fleets.\u201d\nKandji was built around the concept of Blueprints\u2014collections of Library Items that deploy profiles, settings, scripts, security controls, and apps to devices. Any device that\u2019s assigned to a Blueprint gets all those Library Items. Blueprints offer a direct, straightforward, point-and-click way to configure devices at scale.\nKandji\u2019s Assignment Maps expounds on the intuitiveness and clarity of Kandji Blueprints, adding greater automation, flexibility, and granularity.\nWhat makes Assignment Maps unique is that they are made up of conditional blocks, drawn on an infinite canvas, that contain one or more assignment nodes. Each node is a collection of settings and configurations that are to be assigned to a group of devices. Conditional logic determines whether or not the items in a node are assigned and, if so, to which devices. For IT teams, this allows configurations to be easily grouped together and nested. Additional benefits of Assignment Maps include:\nAs with Classic Blueprints, allows a device to belong to just one map at a time, and only Library Items included on that map can be installed on those devices.\nAllows configurations to be nested, to increase granularity and specificity in assignments.\nIntroduces a new device lookup feature that makes it easy to identify why specific Library Items were installed or configured on a specific device.\nPrevents two or more conflicting settings from being assigned to a device, using a system of inherent priority that resolves conflicts before they\u2019re applied to a device.\nCreates visibility into the relationships between groups of devices and to see which settings and configurations are being applied to them.\nThe introduction of Assignment Maps is the first in a series of upcoming additions from Kandji that will continue to make device enrollment and management more seamless and automated.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Overtakes Apple: ETFs to Tap the Incredible Growth Story",
        "Author": "  Sweta Killa ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA NVDA has been on an explosive surge with no signs of a slowdown, fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy and blockbuster earnings. The chipmaker overtook Apple AAPL, topping $3 trillion in market cap and becoming the second-most valuable company in the United States. NVIDIA hit the $1 trillion mark in May 2023 and reached $2 trillion by February 2024, surpassing Amazon and Alphabet.Investors can tap into its incredible growth with the help of ETFs that have the largest allocation to this AI darling. These include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP and TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ. All these funds have NVIDIA as the top holding with a large concentration.The latest catalyst in driving the growth is the stock split and the fervor surrounding the next-generation AI chips. The solid trend is likely to continue.NVIDIA sparked a retail frenzy on the 10-for-1 stock split news. At the end of the week, NVDA will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, which will make its shares more affordable to a wider range of investors, including the ones who make small trades, and increase liquidity. In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price. However, the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s valuation (read: ETFs to Tap on NVIDIA's 10-for-1 Stock Split Retail Frenzy).The stock split will also likely pave the way for NVIDIA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, like Amazon (AMZN), which joined the index earlier this year after undergoing a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022.NVIDIA has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. Last weekend, the AI chipmaker unveiled a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip \u2014 called the Blackwell Ultra \u2014 slated to release in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027. Its first Blackwell processors are slated for delivery later this year, replacing the widely popular Hopper generative AI chips.Companies like Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are rapidly expanding their AI computing capabilities, boosting NVIDIA's growth. NVIDIA has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, which are attracting billions of dollars in spending from big cloud vendors.Further, Elon Musk recently announced that AI start-up xAI's supercomputer will run on NVIDIA technology. This week, Foxconn announced its plans to build an advanced computing center in Taiwan using NVIDIA's Blackwell chips. These are expected to provide a further boost to the company\u2019s growth prospects.\nWall Street analysts are going more bullish on NVIDIA and continue to boost their price targets. This week, Bank of America called NVIDIA a \"top pick,\" reiterating its buy rating on the stock and raising its price target to $1,500 from $1,320. As the chipmaker is accelerating its product upgrade cycle, the analyst believes the move will \"continue to bolster NVIDIA\u2019s AI leadership position.\"Driven by explosive growth prospects, Wall Street analysts have turned more bullish on NVIDIA and raised the target price on the stock post-earnings. At least 28 of the 58 brokerage firms have raised their price targets on the stock, pushing up the median view to $1,200, according to the recent LSEG data.NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.20 a month ago based on 40 recommendations.Of the 41 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.8% and 4.88% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 87.5%, while Buy represented 5%.\nNVIDIA stock has risen more than 140% this year and 200% over the past year. It is by far the biggest outperformer among the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d However, its valuation does not seem overstretched, given that its earnings are growing faster than the share price. NVIDIA is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 42.85 versus 47.81 for Advanced Micro Devices AMD (read: AMD-Nvidia ETFs in Focus Amid New Chip Introductions).\nStrive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC)Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF seeks broad market exposure to the U.S. semiconductor sector.

        "Title": "Meta and Apple will likely be the first targets of Europe\u2019s new antitrust powers",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "Meta already has good reason to be mad at European tech regulators. On Friday, it had to effectively pause its rollout of Meta AI in Europe, at the request of its main privacy regulator in Ireland, after privacy advocates loudly complained that Meta can\u2019t train its AI on the personal data of European Facebook and Instagram users without their consent.\n\u201cWithout including local information we\u2019d only be able to offer people a second-rate experience,\u201d Meta griped, calling it \u201ca step backwards for European innovation.\u201d But that annoyance is nothing compared to what\u2019s reportedly around the corner.\nAccording to Reuters, the European Commission is gearing up to make Meta and Apple the first targets of its new antitrust powers, based on the Digital Markets Act that took effect a few months ago. As also reported by the Financial Times, Apple\u2019s charges will likely arrive first, followed by those for Meta.\nWe\u2019ll get to the Apple issues in a moment, but those that will reportedly lead to Meta charges are not a million miles away from those holding up its European AI ambitions.\nIn the case of Meta AI, the problem is that the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demands that any processing of personal data needs a solid legal basis\u2014there\u2019s a list of six potential options. Meta had been hoping that it could get away with claiming vaguely that its \u201clegitimate interests\u201d justify the use of European users\u2019 data as model-training fodder, but that didn\u2019t fly with regulators, so its only plausible option is to get each user\u2019s consent. For whatever reason, it isn\u2019t taking that option just yet.\nMeta\u2019s DMA woes are also down to data protection and the need for consent, only this time it\u2019s about tracking users for ad-targeting purposes.\nOver the years, a succession of legal cases (initiated by Austrian activist lawyer Max Schrems) has systemically removed the legal justifications that Meta can use for this tracking, again leaving it with valid consent as the only remaining option. But because few people would naturally choose to opt into online surveillance, Meta attempted a subscription gambit in which users could pay as much as $13 monthly to get ad-free Meta services, otherwise they would have to consent to tracking in order to use Facebook and Instagram.\nAs I wrote in April, Europe\u2019s privacy regulators agreed with Schrems and other activists, deciding that Big Tech platforms generally can\u2019t claim they have valid consent for tracking if the only alternative is paying a fee. And because antitrust and privacy law have been blurring into each other in recent years\u2014regulators have realized that market-dominating companies maintain their positions partly through the accumulation of data\u2014this tactic arguably manages to fall foul of both the GDPR and the DMA.\nMeta declined to comment on the Reuters report, saying it was speculative.\nAs for Apple, well, if you followed the drama of that company\u2019s sullen attempts to comply with the letter of the DMA while trampling over its spirit, you can guess what those charges will likely be about. If you managed to stay blissfully unaware of the drama, here\u2019s the gist: The DMA forced Apple to allow third-party iOS app stores in Europe, but when it did so, it introduced a \u20ac0.50 ($0.54) \u201ccore technology fee\u201d for every first installation of each app published by a developer who chose to make its apps available in a third-party app store.\nIn other words, developers were finally free to steer clear of Apple\u2019s distribution mechanism and the revenue cut that Apple demands, but they\u2019d lose a ton of money if their app was free to download, as most are.\nCompanies with plans to introduce third-party app stores on iOS, like Meta and Microsoft, complained that Apple\u2019s new fee made the concept unviable. As the DMA demands that platform \u201cgatekeepers\u201d like Apple apply \u201cfair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory general conditions of access\u201d\u00a0for other businesses, I wrote at the time that Apple was unlikely to get away with this tactic. And here we are\u2014this is reportedly going to be the crux of the EU\u2019s charges.\nLike Meta, Apple declined to comment on the report of this oncoming train, which will bring with it the threat of fines running to a maximum of 10% of global annual revenue.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Apple's Stock Price Just Exploded. Time to Buy?",
        "Author": "  David Moadel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When Wall Street is between earnings season cycles, technology stock traders must derive excitement wherever they can find it. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently delivered a prime example of this as the company presented its latest and supposedly greatest wares at a closely watched tech conference.\nIn a time when the market's attitude toward artificial intelligence (AI) integration is \"more equals better,\" Apple certainly gave the people what they wanted. At the same time, Apple's success in dazzling the AI-obsessed crowds may have caused investors to ignore a growing threat from the one entity that might actually be more powerful and better capitalized than Apple: the U.S. government.\nIn case anybody didn't get the memo that Apple is now all AI, all the time, the company debuted its generative AI (gen-AI)-focused Apple Intelligence platform at this year's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). To drive the point home, Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, literally said that AI \"needs to be integrated into the experience you're using all the time.\"\nBearing out Apple's relentless AI strategy, the company unveiled a new gen-AI enhanced version of the Siri voice assistant that can understand the content on your phone's screen and utilize that knowledge to provide more personalized query responses. Moreover, Apple announced that it would integrate the ChatGPT gen-AI chatbot into iPhones and revealed a number of AI-powered features for the iOS 18 operating system, set for release this fall.\nThus, Apple hammered home the AI 24/7 message, and that's exactly what the market wanted to hear. Apple stock exploded nearly 7% higher the day after the WWDC, breaking above $200 and touching an all-time high.\nOf course, the market doesn't like AI for AI's sake. Investors presumably bid up the Apple share price based on the assumption that gen-AI enhancements would boost iPhone sales.\nThat assumption, in turn, is based on the belief that current users would feel the need to upgrade their iPhones. D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria summed up this optimistic takeaway, writing, \"The critical piece of information was that the functionality will only be backward compatible to iPhone 15 Pro...which means it could lead to a much-needed iPhone upgrade cycle.\"\nFair enough, but there's a difference between \"could lead to\" and \"will lead to.\" With Apple stock already carving out a new high, investors should consider whether the market may have already priced in the assumption of a massive wave of AI-prompted iPhone upgrades.\nWhile the WWDC was front-page news in the financial press, investors might have overlooked a concurrent piece of unfavorable news for Apple. Specifically, four U.S. states -- Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Washington -- joined 15 other states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Apple.\nThe lawsuit dates back to March, and it accuses Apple of, among other things, monopolizing the smartphone market via contractual restrictions on developers. Apple countered that it \"faces fierce competition from well-established rivals,\" though one might wonder who those U.S.-based smartphone market rivals would actually be -- Alphabet's Google, perhaps? That's one, but \"well-established rivals\" is plural, and Apple would have to argue in court that America's smartphone is at least an oligopoly, if not a fully free market.\nSuch are the knock-on effects of being the king of the hill, apparently. Market dominance will inevitably attract regulatory scrutiny, and surely Apple is sufficiently capitalized to absorb the legal costs of doing business.\nThat said, judicious investors shouldn't simply ignore the regulatory risks, as the market evidently did the day after the WWDC. As Apple pays the unavoidable price for its smartphone market juggernaut status, investors can respond with awareness, appropriate due diligence, and position-size moderation.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chinese consumers show the strongest interest globally in smartphones with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, but foreign handset makers such as Apple will face localisation challenges in the market due to regulatory requirements, according to a new report.\nAccording to a report published by market research firm Canalys on Friday, 43 per cent of consumers in China - the world's largest smartphone market - expressed high to very high interest in AI smartphones, a greater percentage than in India and the US, the second and third biggest global smartphone market, respectively.\nThe report found that 71 per cent of Chinese consumers were willing to pay extra for AI features, which offered brands a good foundation for establishing a business model and achieving profitability, Canalys wrote.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe Chinese market, however, also presents challenges to global AI smartphone makers thanks in part to local regulations for large language models and data sovereignty, the firm noted.\n\"All AI-capable smartphones shipping in mainland China's market are likely to be mandated to use one of the commercial LLMs approved by the government,\" the Canalys report said.\nApple, for instance, may not be able to offer its virtual assistant Siri in China using ChatGPT, the popular chatbot launched by US start-up OpenAI in 2022, according to Canalys. Apple announced earlier this month that it is partnering with OpenAI, which will make its chatbot available for free on several Apple platforms later this year.\nThe Canalys report found that 71 per cent of Chinese consumers were willing to pay extra for AI features. Photo: Shutterstock Images alt=The Canalys report found that 71 per cent of Chinese consumers were willing to pay extra for AI features.

Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nApple may also need to set up local servers in China for mainland Chinese user data as part of its Private Cloud Compute system, which was launched earlier this month for private AI processing, Canalys said.\nApple's plans to add AI capabilities to its iPhones have received mixed reactions in China, where consumers are unsure about when such features will be available locally, and as cheaper handsets from Chinese brands have been aggressive in integrating AI.\nChinese smartphone makers including Honor, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi have all started to introduce AI features since last year, Canalys said.\nHuawei Technologies, on the other hand, has been \"keeping a relatively low profile\" in its generative AI investments, despite being one of the earliest smartphone vendors to use AI chips for tasks such as image optimisation, according to the research firm.\nHuawei, similar to Apple and Google, has the advantage of being what it calls a \"full stack player\", with solutions spanning software, cloud infrastructure and end user devices, it said.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "The Fly ",
        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: \nBMO Capital upgraded Kroger (KR) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $60, up from $58. The stock has pulled back on fear over increasing price investments across the space, but the firm believes these are largely vendor-funded with a smaller component of retailer-funded promotions and believes Kroger's positioning allows it to continue managing the competitive environment with stable gross margins\nGoldman Sachs upgraded STMicroelectronics (STM) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $45.80, up from $35.50. The firm is citing the company's improving demand conditions in various end markets and year-to-date underperformance relative to its benchmark index and analog semis peers.\nCiti upgraded Sunoco LP (SUN) to Buy from Neutral with a $65 price target. Following recent underperformance that the firm believes was driven mainly by technical factors, Citi sees over 30% total return upside.\nArgus upgraded Juniper (JNPR) to Buy from Hold with a $40 price target. The firm cites the pending takeover by HP Enterprise (HPE), while noting that its stance on the deal is \"more constructive.\"\nCraig-Hallum upgraded QuinStreet (QNST) to Buy from Hold with a $22 price target. The firm notes that it has spent the last year on the sidelines, waiting for evidence of an auto insurance recovery, as well as a level-setting of estimates., but believes both of these are now in place, which combined with a recent pullback in shares, have created the right entry point.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nPhillip Securities downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral from Accumulate after considering recent share price movements, while increasing the firm's price target to $220 from $194.\nJanney Montgomery Scott downgraded First Solar (FSLR) to Neutral from Buy with a fair value estimate of $260, up from $236. After having recently had the chance to catch up with First Solar management heading into the end of the quarter, the firm thinks its updated valuation construct is \"more in line with how the buyside is currently thinking,\" adding that it thinks core EPS margin expansion \"could be tougher from current levels.\"\nJPMorgan downgraded Sportradar (SRAD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $12, down from $13, as a different analyst at the firm assumed coverage of the stock. The firm believes the current valuation is \"properly incorporating a degree of execution risk\" given concerns of data rights cost inflation, a CFO transition, and the effectiveness of the recent strategic realignment.\nWells Fargo downgraded Aerovate Therapeutics (AVTE) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $2, down from $35, following the company's announcement that AV-101 did not meet its primary endpoint for any of the studied doses or show meaningful improvements in the secondary endpoint of change in six-minute walk distance.\nOppenheimer downgraded Ovid Therapeutics (OVID) to Perform from Outperform. The firm notes Ovid recently reported that partner Takeda (TAK) failed to hit statistical significance on the primary endpoint in both its pivotal Phase 3 studies of Soticlestat in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nArgus initiated coverage of Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) with a Buy rating and $41 price target. The firm sees high demand for chicken at both full-service restaurants and fast-food chains due to beef shortages and expectation for low-single-digit supply increases over the next five years.\nDeutsche Bank resumed coverage of DigitalBridge (DBRG) with a Buy rating with a price target of $17, down from $21. The firm calls DigitalBridge \"a thematically unique, underappreciated 'AI' story\" whose fundamentals reflect an \"impressive ramp\" in fee earning equity under management, or FEEUM, and fee-related earnings, or FRE.\nCantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Innoviva (INVA) with an Overweight rating. Innoviva has a unique business model, consisting of a portfolio of royalties and healthcare assets that includes royalties coming from GSK (GSK) respiratory products, a critical care and infectious disease platform known as Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics, and a portfolio of strategic investments in healthcare assets, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nNorthland initiated coverage of Cardlytics (CDLX) with an Outperform rating and $14 price target. Cardlytics has made significant improvements across the business and the firm believes the company is in a position to re-accelerate growth, which it does not think is reflected by the current stock price.\nAlliance Global Partners initiated coverage of Chromocell Therapeutics (CHRO) with a Buy rating and $8.50 price target. Chromocell's pipeline includes two lead non-opioid pain-alleviating candidates, CC8464 and CT2000, and the firm's sum-of-the-parts analysis values CT2000 at $5 per share, CC8464 for idiopathic small fiber neuropathy, or ISFN, at $1.50 per share, and the company's remaining compounds, underlying technology and cash at $2 per share.\n"

He currently ranks as the world\u2019s 12th richest person with a personal net worth estimated at $115 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nLong known as a maker of high-end graphics cards for PC gamers, Nvidia has emerged in recent years as the key supplier for firms racing to develop advanced AI.\nThe firm controls roughly 80% of the market for the computer chips used to power AI data centers, according to CNBC.\nIn blockbuster first-quarter earnings results last month, Nvidia revealed revenue for its data center segment rose to $22.6 billion \u2013 a stunning increase of 427% compared to the same period one year ago.\nNvidia\u2019s rise has drawn the attention of federal antitrust regulators.\nThe Justice Department has reportedly launched a probe into the chipmaking company\u2019s business and whether it has violated competition laws.\nIn an interview with the FT, DOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter noted that advanced chips have become a \u201cscarce resource\u201d and signaled his team was examining the process by which chipmakers decide which companies receive the critical products.\nMicrosoft and Apple have each made their own forays into the AI race. Microsoft has poured $13 billion into OpenAI \u2014 a deal which itself is under regulatory scrutiny \u2014 while Apple recently announced a suite of AI features will debut in its products this fall.\nApple also has a partnership with OpenAI.\nDespite their astronomical valuations, some analysts say the tech firms are still poised for growth.\n\u201cWe believe over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients. \u201cNvidia\u2019s GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway.\u201d\n"

        "Text": "Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality (XR) headset will be available for pre-order in China starting on Friday, four months after the gadget went on sale in the US.\nEach customer is limited to purchasing two headsets and shipments start on June 28, according to Apple's website. At a price of 29,999 yuan (US$4,138), it costs over US$600 more than the US$3,499 base price in the US, which does not account for tax, for the 256-gigabyte model.\nThe starting price in Hong Kong, where pre-orders start on the same day as on the mainland, is HK$27,999 (US$3,862).\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe world's second most valuable company has partnered with Chinese entertainment firms to navigate the country's highly regulated online content market. Apple has said that Tencent Holdings' popular Netflix-like streaming service Tencent Video will be available on the Vision Pro.\nOther Chinese tech giants have also rolled out Vision Pro apps. In February, Alibaba Group Holding launched Vision Pro versions of its office tool DingTalk and e-commerce marketplace Taobao. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nThere had previously been some question of whether Apple would be able to use its chosen brand name for the headset in China. Huawei Technologies has exclusive rights to the \"Vision Pro\" trademark in a number of contexts, including virtual reality (VR), through 2031. However, Apple's application for the \"Apple Vision Pro\" trademark, accompanied by the company's logo, was approved in March, according to corporate records provider Qichacha.\nSome China-based Apple enthusiasts have been playing with the gadget for months via grey market rentals. People who had purchased the pricey headset in the US started leasing it to users in several major cities. Beijing-based start-up Vision Space opened multiple bricks-and-mortar locations where people can try it out for 98 yuan per hour.\nAnalysts expected the Vision Pro to reignite a languid VR market that has yet to push its way into the mainstream. Global shipments of VR devices fell 23.5 per cent last year, but \"2024 is shaping up to be a year of recovery as shipments are forecast to surge 44.2 per cent\", in part due to \"new headsets such as Apple's Vision Pro\", market researcher IDC said in an April report.\nApple is likely to face fierce competition in China, where many low-cost headsets are available in the price-sensitive market. TikTok owner ByteDance currently dominates the market through its Pico subsidiary, whose headsets accounted for 56.6 per cent of the market in 2023, according to IDC.\nMeanwhile, Huawei is preparing to launch its own XR headsets later this year, according to Chinese tech blogs.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Here\u2019s Why.\nRivian Gets $5 Billion Lifeline in Joint Venture With Volkswagen\nJulian Assange Leaves Court \u2018Free Man,\u2019 Ending 14-Year Drama\nThere\u2019re now some 900 million Huawei gadgets installed with its inhouse Harmony operating software, up significantly from just a few months ago, consumer business Chairman Richard Yu said. Sales of premium Huawei smartphones climbed 72% in the first five months of 2024, he told attendees at an annual developer forum Friday.\nThose numbers illustrate the phenomenal growth Huawei\u2019s phones have enjoyed since it unveiled the Mate 60 Pro, which contained a 7-nanometer processor that Washington officials didn\u2019t think Chinese firms capable of developing. Business has boomed since, helping Huawei more than quintuple profit during the March quarter and take market share from Apple and Chinese rivals.\n\u201cNo one can extinguish the starlight in the sky. Today, the future of HarmonyOS is set,\u201d Yu told his audience. \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy the brilliant galaxy that belongs to us.\u201d\nHuawei intends to release a successor to its marquee smartphone, the Mate 70, at the end of the year, Yu said. That\u2019s likely to run on HarmonyOS Next, which will sever remaining ties to Google\u2019s Android. Huawei plans to release a beta version for consumers around August, Yu said.\nHuawei has taken HarmonyOS beyond smartphones in past years and into products from watches to TVs. The Chinese company shipped about 11 million wearables in the first quarter, surpassing Samsung Electronics Co., according to IDC. That helped Harmony OS overtake Apple\u2019s iOS in Chinese market share during the January-March period, according to Counterpoint Research. The main driver, however, remained the rising popularity of Huawei\u2019s phones, Counterpoint added.\nHuawei is getting more aggressive at attempting to profit from HarmonyOS as its user base surge. It\u2019s considering taking a cut of in-app purchases, underscoring a growing confidence in competing with the iPhone \u2014 though there\u2019s likely to be at least one notable exception, Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s WeChat.\nIt\u2019s also making progress on the AI front with the Ascend GPU, part of a growing portfolio of chips that prompted Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang to call Huawei a formidable rival.\nChinese firms including Huawei are developing local alternatives to the most powerful AI accelerators that the likes of Nvidia make, which Washington has barred from the country. That effort is considered key to Beijing\u2019s broader ambitions of catching up with the US in AI and chipmaking.\nOn Friday, Yu said its Ascend processors are 1.1 times more effective in training AI models compared with mainstream offerings, though he stopped short of naming specific firms. His company has so far set up three AI data centers powered by Ascend chips in China, helping local firms develop and host artificial intelligence services.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\nWhy BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford\nCorporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash\nIndependence Without Accountability: The Fed\u2019s Great Inflation Fail\nMusk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains the stock market\u2019s most valuable company, worth $3.15 trillion. That\u2019s a mind-boggling number. But how long will it hold onto the top spot of trillion-dollar stocks?\nBoth Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fight for the second sport with both worth about $3 trillion. Apple is No. 2 as of this writing, but that was flip-flopping last week as the chipmaker surged to surpass the consumer tech giant briefly.\nOnly six companies out of the thousands that trade on the market are worth $1 trillion or more. Several are within shouting distance of the threshold. Below are three stocks that could be the next trillion-dollar stocks to buy.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\nAt a market valuation of $418 million, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is less than halfway to the goal. Yet, it is well within the realm of possibility for the credit card processor to reach a $1 trillion valuation.\nOver the past decade, Mastercard stock has appreciated at a 17.5% compounded annual rate. That suggests that if it continues at that pace, Mastercard could cross the finish line within five years. And we\u2019re not talking about some tech stocks (all six existing trillion-dollar stocks are technology stocks). This is a mature, rather mundane business of processing payment transactions, which underscores the health and strength of Mastercard.\nA bet on Mastercard becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2035 is a bet on the long-term growth in U.S. consumer spending and an ever-expanding U.S. economy. Both seem like even-money bets.\nNot that it will be a straight shot. A recession could slow its growth. Total household non-housing debt stands at a record $4.87 trillion. Overall, Mastercard stock seems an easy pick for hitting a trillion-dollar valuation.\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nHealth insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is an even likelier candidate for achieving a $1 trillion valuation than Mastercard. The 10-year stock return for UNH stock is higher than that of the payments processor, at over 500%. That means it could cross the threshold sooner than Mastercard. Its growth could accelerate.\nThe healthcare industry has been under enormous pressure due to the pandemic, inflation and labor shortages. Industry analysts at McKinsey say the tide is turning, especially in the managed care population. Patients who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare represents \u201cone of the most substantial opportunities for payers.\u201d\nUnitedHealth is seeing robust growth in Medicare Advantage revenue, which grew almost 3% in the first quarter to $7.7 billion from the year-ago period. It was up sequentially from the fourth quarter as well. Medicaid revenue, however, was down sharply year-over-year. The insurer also saw a slight improvement in Medicare supplemental revenue compared to last year.\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s revenue rose $8 billion in the quarter to almost $100 billion. Although it reported a net loss of $1.53 per share, that was wholly due to selling its Brazilian sale and the impact of a cyberattack it suffered. Look for UnitedHealth\u2019s performance to improve as these one-time costs move into the rearview mirror and it expands into new lines of business.\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\nAt over $574 billion, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is already more than halfway there. The stock of the financial industry giant is up over 17% in 2024 and 42% higher over the last 12 months. At these growth rates, it could achieve trillion-dollar status in no time.\nHowever, its 10-year growth rate is substantially lower than that of either Mastercard or UnitedHealth, so investors should not expect that pace to continue. Still, there seems little doubt the country\u2019s biggest bank will reach that valuation.\nIt is already benefiting from the Federal Reserve\u2019s higher-for-longer interest rate policies. Higher rates boost JPMorgan\u2019s net interest income (NII), which surged 19% last year to $24.2 billion as the Fed raised rates an unprecedented 11 times between 2022 and 2023. NII was up another 11% in the first quarter of 2024.\nFed bank presidents, however, recently expressed doubts about any rate cuts coming soon.\u00a0They want sustained progress on inflation, not just a one-quarter improvement. The May jobs report showed that 272,000 new jobs were created, well ahead of expectations of 180,000 new jobs. That puts the prospects for a rate cut even more in doubt.\nLast year, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck called JPMorgan an \u201cunderappreciated rate play\u201d and said she saw the bank becoming a trillion-dollar stock. Her timeline, though, was 12 years down the road, maybe eight if it cut costs or increased the rate of revenue growth. JPM might not cross the threshold faster than some other companies, but it seems clear the bank will eventually be worth $1 trillion.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In January, some merchants on the locally popular online flea market Xianyu, owned by South China Morning Post owner Alibaba Group Holding, offered to ship the device from the US at double the official price.\nSome domestic merchants in February started to offer the Vision Pro for rent, weeks after the device was released for sale in the US. Rental costs varied from 98 yuan an hour to 1,500 yuan per day.\nBut high interest may not immediately translate into strong sales, as the Vision Pro's target consumers in China are likely to have already bought outside official channels, according to research firm Counterpoint.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Top Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Paul Tudor Jones\u00a0recently made headlines\u00a0 after he participated in the Robin Hood foundation\u2019s fundraising event dressed as Neo from the movie \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d The event raised $68.5 million. The billionaire, who founded Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980, couldn\u2019t help himself but talk about investing during the event, and highlighted the importance of \u201cWarren Buffett-style compounding.\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere, somehow the multiplicative power of compound put you in this seat,\u201d Tudor Jones said.\nDuring an interview last year, the billionaire had predicted that a recession was expected to start in the first quarter of 2024. He said at the time that the US was in its \u201cweakest position\u201d since World War II. However, the market rally fueled by AI proved the prediction wrong. Earlier this year, \u00a0Jones said in another interview that the financial markets represent people\u2019s ideas and what they make of the economic situation. Paul Tudor Jones said that there\u2019s a chance the stock market would be \u201chere or lower\u201d in the next five to ten years. However, the billionaire also said it\u2019s possible that the markets would go higher from here if the next President of the US devises a better \u201cpolicy response\u201d next year.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Billionaire Cooperman\u2019s Top Dividend Picks\u00a0and\u00a0Analysts Are Upgrading These AI Stocks\nHe\u2019s been vocal about AI lately and sharing his thoughts about the impact of technology on our society. He thinks AI could be the \u201cknight on the horse that rides and saves us.\u201d\nBut AI-related threats worry Paul Tudor Jones.\u00a0 In an interview in January he referred to a survey where close to 3,000 AI experts were asked whether they believe AI would end humanity. According to Jones, a whopping 58% of the experts said yes. The billionaire said US policymakers will have to decide how to tackle this problem. Jones believes AI is growing at an \u201cunbridled pace\u201d since there\u2019s so much money to be made in the domain but the biggest problem for policymakers would be to balance the benefits and threats of AI to make it sustainable.\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Paul Tudor Jones\u2019 Q1 portfolio and chose his top dividend stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBillionaire Paul Tudor Jones\u00a0Q1\u20192024 Stake: $57,187,894\nDespite having a low dividend yield, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is a notable dividend stock thanks to almost a decade of dividend growth and strong share upside potential amid AI-related catalysts. Bank of America recently said in a note Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0plans to overhaul its Siri assistant with new AI-powered features could infuse a new iPhone upgrade cycle. BofA\u2019s Wamsi Mohan expects conversational AI to become more popular and give a boost to AI-powered phones. He has a Buy rating and $230 price target on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes \u201cowning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return\u201d because the market is in denial about Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI potential. Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a09.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But all of this could change if Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is able to pull AI-related catalysts out of its bag. The WWDC event and the new few weeks and months would be critical for Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0growth trajectory.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company\u2019s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company\u2019s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\nOverall, Apple Inc.

HarmonyOS had 4 per cent share worldwide in the same period.\nThe growing domestic adoption of HarmonyOS shows how Huawei's strategy to build an Android alternative has started to pay off, overcoming the impact of US government-imposed tech restrictions when the company was added to Washington's Entity List in May 2019.\nUnder that trade blacklist, Huawei is barred from buying software, chips and other US-origin technologies from suppliers without Washington's approval.

HarmonyOS Next will no longer support Android-based applications.\nHuawei plans to release HarmonyOS Next with the Mate 70 series flagship smartphones later this year, rotating chairman Eric Xu Zhijun said in May.\nThe company stood out as the best performer among all major smartphone vendors on the mainland in the first quarter when its sales grew 69.7 per cent year on year, according to Counterpoint. The research firm largely attributed that performance to Huawei's popular 5G Mate 60 series and strong brand reputation, which helped the firm gain more share in the premium segment where handsets are priced from US$600.\nAs of January, more than 200 partners have initiated development of HarmonyOS-based apps, according to Huawei, which has said it aims to have 5,000 partners on board by the end of this year.\nMajor enterprises that have started development of HarmonyOS-based apps include Alibaba Group Holding, Meituan, Ant Group, JD.com and McDonald's China.

Consistent acceleration of growth globally and tapping into growing markets, like Brazil, China and South Africa while maintaining its stronghold in Mexico have been key factors in its success.\nApparel: Nike retains its No.1 brand position in Apparel, but the gap between competitors has narrowed. Zara's 47% growth made it the second biggest riser in terms of rank change in the Global Top 100, rising 24 places to No.70. Lululemon's innovative approach to athleisure and commitment to quality delivered 24% brand value growth, lifting it into the Global Top 100 for the first time.\nLuxury: Louis Vuitton remains the most valuable brand in the luxury category with a brand valuation of $130 billion. Herm\u00e8s has also excelled by enhancing its exclusivity and premium pricing, thriving in both US and Chinese markets, leading to a 23% growth in brand value.\nMedia & Entertainment: Netflix reached new heights, climbing to No.4 from No.6 in the category. Its increase in brand value of 51% was driven by unprecedented subscriber growth, as well as a password sharing crackdown, highlighting the streaming service's confidence in the strength of its customer predisposition.\nRetail: Amazon retains its position as the most valuable retail brand with brand value growth of 6%.

Get you where you wanna go quicker.\u201d\nThe R&B icon, who made history as the most-watched Super Bowl performance of all time, infamously sang, danced, and entertained 130 million viewers at this year\u2019s game\u2013all while wearing a pair of roller skates.\nTwo main results from Usher and Cook\u2019s meeting emerged: an instant meme of Cook wearing a t-shirt with Usher\u2019s face ironed onto it, plus suggestions for how to help the approximately 1.45 million Americans currently living with type 1 diabetes.\n\u201cThat t-shirt is probably going to be valued for millions someday so I'm hoping that I can get one,\u201d the singer joked in an interview with Fortune.\nAfter his star-studded Super Bowl performance, Usher says he\u2019s now readying his talents for a different stage: Capitol Hill.\nUsher is set to join a contingent led by French pharma giant Sanofi that will meet with legislators in Washington, D.C. later this month to discuss the importance of early screening for type 1 diabetes, a condition that\u2019s thought to be caused by an autoimmune disease that leads the body to mistakenly attack insulin-producing cells.\nIt\u2019s a cause that\u2019s personal for the performer, who has been an outspoken advocate for more awareness about the condition after his child was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2014 at age six.\n\u201cMy child was urinating a lot and was a bit lethargic and very tired,\u201d he explained to Fortune. \u201cThere were no real explanations behind it.\u201d\nUsher described the diabetes diagnosis experience as \u201cshocking\u201d since no other relatives were known to have had the condition.\n\u201cMy grandmother had type 2 diabetes, and I could remember drawing insulin and watching her take her blood sugar levels and also having to watch her administer insulin,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo I did understand the treatment of diabetes but not type 1, especially not for an infant.\u201d\nTen years later, Usher is now a paid spokesperson for Sanofi, ranked #299 on the Fortune Global 500, and hopes to assist other parents and caregivers through a process he describes as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\nAccording to new research released Wednesday from Beyond Type 1, a nonprofit cofounded by singer Nick Jonas, 79% of adults with type 1 diabetes said they felt underprepared and overwhelmed when they first learned of their diagnosis. \"The Cost of Not Knowing\u201d study, commissioned by Sanofi and conducted by Wakefield Research among 1,000 U.S. adults with type 1 diabetes and 1,000 caregivers to children, found that 88% of patients required emergency care for their type 1 symptoms before or during their diagnosis.\nThe number of Americans with type 1 diabetes is expected to jump to 2.1 million people by 2040\u2013a nearly eight-fold increase since 1990, according to Beyond Type 1. The financial toll of that diagnosis can be steep; half of respondents with type 1 diabetes spent at least $5,000 on emergency care, and nearly a quarter reported spending at least $10,000.\n\u201cMost Americans don't have $1,000 in their savings account, so it's something that could very easily put a family into extraordinary financial distress, causing people to take on debt,\u201d Kristian Hurley, senior vice president of programs, advocacy, and health equity at Beyond Type 1, told Fortune.\nType 1 and type 2 diabetes cost Americans $413 billion per year in medical expenses and reduced productivity, according to the American Diabetes Association. While most common in children and young adults, type 1 can happen to anyone at any age, and about 90% of those diagnosed had no family history, according to research nonprofit JDRF. Hurley said those with type 1 diabetes have described it as \u201cconstantly having a math problem\u201d to solve when checking insulin levels and medication.\n\u201cType 1 doesn't take a day off, so in everything that you do, you have to be able to make sure that you're supporting your needs as it relates to insulin,\u201d Kristian Hurley said. \u201cIt's a full-time job.\u201d\nAs Usher prepares to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill later this month, he says he\u2019s \u201cexcited\u201d for the opportunity to share his family\u2019s story.\n\u201cIf I am to use this very complicated experience that I have for something that is positive, and to bring about positive support, then I want to be there for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm there simply to share my story; I'm a storyteller.\u201d\nThe mission is not new for the singer; last year, Usher and Sanofi launched the \"The 1 Pledge,\" a nationwide educational campaign to encourage screening for type 1 diabetes before noticeable symptoms arise.\nThough he describes the impact of T1D on his family as \u201ccomplicated,\u201d he hopes the visit to D.C. will be a collaborative way to educate Americans on early screening.\n\u201cI make music and I actually tell stories, but this one is one that I feel is necessary and could potentially help a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like sharing my story could potentially bring support to people who really need it.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

The market cap of iPhone-maker Apple's, meanwhile, has reached $3.26 trillion, just outpacing AI-darling Nvidia's valuation of $3.24 trillion.\nIn a note to clients on Sunday, the Wedbush analysts laid out the case for optimism surrounding each company.\nFor Microsoft, the analysts argued that AI will help the firm monetize its \"massive\" base of installed enterprise users over the coming years. Microsoft, which has previously backed ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has outlined plans to bring AI into a number of fields across the business world with its Copilot offering.\nDespite recently being widely considered to be a laggard in the AI race, Apple unveiled a string of AI-powered enhancements to its products at its annual developers conference last week that the Wedbush analysts said could trigger a \"super cycle\" in iPhone sales.\nFinally, the Wedbush analysts said Nvidia's AI-optimized chips are \"in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector\" as an increasing number of businesses embrace the nascent technology.\nAlthough they flagged that AI could disrupt near-term sales cycles in some tech stocks, the analysts added the \"massive\" expected wave of expenditures will not only fuel a new \"industrial revolution\" in the tech industry but also underpin a broader market rally \"well in 2025.\"\n\"In a nutshell, we believe this tech bull market has legs that will ultimately broaden out to the rest of software, consumer tech, cyber security, semis, and infrastructure over the next 12 to 18 months,\" the Wedbush analysts said.\nRelated Articles\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia in race to hit $4 trillion market cap - Wedbush\nAnalysis-French election worries rekindle market memories of UK budget rout\nStanChart loses bid to cut US sanctions breach claims from UK lawsuit\n"

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nBank of America reiterated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock as their Top Pick, maintaining a price target of $230.\nIn particular, Wall Street giant analysts are bullish about Apple's transition from smartphones to \"IntelliPhones,\" predicting a significant multi-year upgrade cycle.\n\"We view the upcoming AI-enabled phones (IntelliPhones) to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle similar to the step function improvement driven by the introduction of smartphones,\" the note stated.\nBofA\u2019s team believes that with a vast installed base of over four billion smartphones, the adoption of AI-enabled IntelliPhones will surpass the rapid uptake seen with smartphones and 5G.\nIntelliPhones are expected to leverage advanced AI and machine learning for features such as superior personal assistance, language processing, health monitoring, enhanced photography, and AR/VR experiences, among other things.\nNeedham analysts on Thursday downgraded UiPath (NYSE:PATH) stock from Buy to Hold citing a mix of factors, including macroeconomic headwinds and a changing go-to-market (GTM) strategy.\n\"We downgrade PATH shares to Hold due to a combination of macro pressure, uncertainty around near-term execution due to a CEO change and a changing GTM strategy, and Y/Y margin compression creating an unfavorable near-term financial profile,\u201d analysts wrote.\nThe investment firm noted that the company's Q1F25 sales metrics were mildly disappointing, with large deals facing incremental scrutiny.\nThe recent CEO change back to founder Daniel Dines, following Rob Enslin's departure, and multiple GTM changes are expected to cause near-term sales disruptions.\nNet new annual recurring revenue (ARR) and revenue guidance were both lowered, which Needham believes is \u201cconservative enough, but we think it will take multiple quarters for the GTM changes to start driving meaningful upside to guidance.\u201d\nEnterprise AI firm C3.ai (NYSE:AI) saw its shares upgraded by Northland analysts during the week from Market Perform to Outperform, with a target price of $35.\nAnalysts highlighted the company\u2019s rising subscription growth in Q4 2024 as a key factor behind the upward revision.\n\"C3.ai posted accelerating subscription growth to 41% in 4Q24, providing evidence that the headwinds from a migration to a usage-based revenue model are abating,\" analysts commented.\nLooking forward, strong pilot expansion and demand for generative AI (genAI) signal continued high growth, they added.\nJapanese investment banking and securities firm Mizuho lifted its price targets on several chipmakers this week, including Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).\nThe move comes as Mizuho analysts believe the next catalyst for AI will be at the edge, as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) push AI on-device capabilities for handsets and PCs.\nThe firm reiterated Buy ratings, raising price targets to $240 for Micron, $155 for Qualcomm, $90 for Seagate, and $110 for Western Digital.\nAnalysts highlighted Qualcomm's ramp-up with AI PCs using Snapdragon X Elite and Plus, and the expected increase in AI smartphone shipments.\nMoreover, AI PCs, requiring 40% to 80% more DRAM, and handsets needing 50% to 100% more DRAM, present tailwinds for Micron. Western Digital and Micron are also expected to benefit from higher NAND content in AI devices with improved pricing.\nMeanwhile, Seagate stands out with higher storage content on PCs and increasing cloud capital expenditure. Mizuho forecasts 1 billion AI smartphones shipped from 2024 to 2027, with AI PCs comprising up to 60% of the PC market by 2027.\nIn a new note to clients, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated a Buy rating on Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) shares and lifted their price target from $125 to $185, emphasizing the IT company is \u201cprogressing as a legit GenAI participant.\u201d\n\"Dell continues to show legitimate GenAI progression the last 90 days which seemingly could progress through CY2025,\" Loop analysts stated.\nThe investment bank pointed out Dell's well-positioned stance for long-term commercial IT budget share, noting the company's expanding capabilities across infrastructure products, services, and financing.\nDell identified a $2 to $3 attach revenue opportunity in services, networking, and storage for every $1 of GenAI server revenue.\n\u201cOn storage specifically, there has been a suggestion in our work that for commercial (non-Hyperscale) Gen AI storage that after VAST Data & WEKA, DELL storage could be as well positioned as PSTG & NTAP, if not better positioned,\u201d analysts wrote.\nAnalysts also highlighted that Dell has pre-purchased over $7 billion in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, significantly boosting inventory in the last 90 days. Dell expects to secure $10 to $15 billion worth of GPUs over the next six quarters, aligning with its potential Generative AI revenue of $9 to $10 billion in 2024 and possibly $15 billion in 2025.\nCurrent guidance for Generative AI server revenue in 2024 is about $5 billion. Despite a slight decline in PC shipments and a 200 basis point drop in market share, Dell's core commercial market exposure is expected to grow in late 2024 and 2025.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple reiterated as Top Pick, C3.ai stock upgraded\nBoeing executives unlikely to be charged over 737 MAX crashes, source says\nDelaware judge lets more than 70,000 Zantac lawsuits go forward\n"

Markets have dialed back expectations for the Fed's first rate cut happening in September, now pricing in about a 50% chance, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.\nGeneral Motors gained 1.35% after the automaker announced a $6 billion share buyback plan. GM also cut its annual EV production forecast.\nAfter the closing bell, Oracle shares rose 8% following the release of quarterly results. The stock ended the regular session down 0.5%.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 45 new highs and 127 new lows.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 10.65 billion shares, compared with the 12.83 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch in New YorkAdditional reporting by Lisa Mattackal and Johann M Cherian in BengaluruEditing by Pooja Desai and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Text": "Soccer fans who haven\u2019t signed up for Apple's streaming service might find it a bit harder to resist, as Apple TV+ has cut the price of its MLS Season Pass in half for the remainder of the 2024 season.\nThe company is now charging Apple TV customers $49 for access to the rest of the games, while those who have an Apple TV+ subscription will pay just $39.\nThat will let fans watch Lionel Messi and other stars in regular season games as well as the upcoming All-Star tournament, where the top players in MLS will take on the best in Liga MX, which gets underway later this month.\nMLS Season Pass subscribers do not have to worry about blackout games and can watch on a variety of Apple devices, as well as most modern TVs and game consoles.\nApple secured a 10-year worldwide deal for MLS games in 2023, paying the league $2.5 billion. The company also brokered an unprecedented revenue-sharing agreement with soccer superstar Messi, spurring him to join Inter Miami CF.\nFor the company, it\u2019s an opportunity to lock-in Gen Z males, who are the biggest watchers of MLS games. The league has the youngest audience among all legacy leagues.\nSoccer has become an increasingly strong draw for networks and streaming services. In 2022, the FIFA World Cup final attracted 26 million U.S. viewers on linear TV\u2014more than the NBA Finals (13 million), the World Series (12 million), PGA Finals (10 million), Stanley Cup (5 million), and even the Winter Olympics (12 million).\nApple could be on the verge of doubling down on the sport, as negotiations are reportedly underway with soccer governing body FIFA to carry worldwide television rights for a new tournament.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "Huawei Technologies has emerged as the big winner in China's smartphone market for the recently-concluded midyear 618 shopping festival with the biggest jump in sales and the smallest discounts, according to the latest data from Counterpoint Research.\nHuawei sales jumped 42.4 per cent during the one-month 618 sales period that started May 20, according to Counterpoint, which attributed the rise to continued strong demand for the company's latest handsets, including those from the Mate 60 and Pura 70 series that run on China-made chips. The company also offered the smallest price discounts relative to major rivals, Counterpoint said.\nApple has been able to defend its position ahead of Huawei by offering its largest-ever discounts for iPhones in China, helping to boost sales by 2.7 per cent year on year amid intensifying competition in the premium segment. Counterpoint figures put Apple as the second-best seller by sales volume for the period, behind Vivo and ahead of Honor, Xiaomi and Huawei.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe 618 festival is China's biggest shopping season after Singles' Day. Amid a sluggish economy, e-commerce operators sought to attract more consumers this year by cancelling the traditional presale stage and extending the promotional period, which ran through June 20.\nTotal smartphone sales volume for the 32-day period grew 6.8 per cent compared with the same period in 2023, according to Counterpoint. The sales performance indicates a warm-up in demand, Counterpoint said, adding that it anticipates low single-digit year-on-year growth for China's smartphone market this year.\nEstimates from TechInsights are more pessimistic. It reported a 2 per cent decline in smartphone sales volume to 13.1 million units during the 618 festival. It expects the market to stay flat at 62.3 billion yuan (US$8.6 billion) this year.\nSlower growth in online shopping and the rapid rise of live-streaming e-commerce have made the traditional sales campaigns associated with shopping festivals less attractive to consumers, TechInsights analyst Peng Peng wrote in a report.\n\"Escalated worries about the downturn of China's economy\", including in the real estate and job markets, are also holding back consumer spending, Peng added.\nWhile Huawei saw the biggest growth in sales, Apple remained king in terms of sales volume and value, according to TechInsights.\nApple's iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max emerged as not only the most popular models in the 6,000 yuan price range, but also across all segments on the e-commerce platform JD.com. It is the latest indication of Apple's continued dominance in China's premium smartphone market, Peng wrote.\nHuawei came in third by sales value, after Xiaomi, and is growing as a major challenger in the high-end market, TechInsights data showed.\nChina's major e-commerce platforms saw gross merchandise value grow 13.6 per cent year on year during the 618 shopping festival, according to research firm Analysys. However, companies have largely stopped publishing their own sales figures for big shopping festivals.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Google downgraded as Apple gets vote of confidence",
        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nA Rosenblatt analyst downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock from Buy to Neutral, based on \u201cmultiple areas of transitional risk that recommend stepping back for a little while to see how the company handles it.\u201d\nThe investment bank identified several risks for the tech giant, including the impact of AI on search, which could negatively affect search ad revenues due to the introduction of AI Overviews. The analyst also noted emerging evidence of search share loss to Bing.\nMoreover, the shift of search ad revenue to retail media networks is expected to accelerate as retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) follow Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) lead in this area.\nAnother risk highlighted by Rosenblatt is Amazon\u2019s aggressive entry into video advertising, with ads becoming default on Prime Video this year and a strong upfront sales effort launched in May, potentially affecting ad sales dynamics at YouTube.\n\u201cWe also see risk that competitive dynamics push Alphabet into a higher-than-anticipated capex spending cycle for AI,\u201d the analyst added.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has recently become the number one company in terms of market valuation, and according to Truist Securities analysts, the company can go from being number one to \u201cnumber on-er.\u201d\nOn June 18, Nvidia\u2019s market cap reached $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world\u2019s most valuable public company. However, Nvidia\u2019s shares subsequently declined over several sessions, causing it to lose the top spot.\n\u201cWe considered that, even if fundamentals cooperate, stock upside could be limited owing to trading and technical challenges related to NVDA's #1 market cap position,\u201d Truist analysts noted.\nDespite this, Truist's analysis suggests that attaining the largest market cap does not inherently hinder future investment returns.\nThe firm reviewed the investment returns and valuations of stocks that have previously held the top market capitalization over the past 26 years, including Microsoft, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Apple and Amazon.\nThe findings showed that most of these stocks underperformed relative to the S&P 500 index over short-term periods of one week, one month, and three months after reaching the top market cap position. However, over longer periods of one year, three years, and five years, these stocks generally outperformed the S&P 500, Truist analysts pointed out.\nRosenblatt Securities upgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to Buy this week, citing the potential of the company's privacy-focused Apple Intelligence platform to boost market share in the AI sector.\nThis decision follows a survey conducted by Rosenblatt, revealing that privacy is the most sought-after feature among US consumers in AI technology.\nThe survey, which garnered over 500 responses, used a \"MaxDiff\" ranking system to assess 15 key features of early smartphone AI. Privacy emerged as the top priority, with 17.8% positive responses, outpacing the next-ranked feature, Insight, by 5.6 percentage points.\n\u201cGiven that Apple has uniquely flagged Private Cloud Compute as core to its approach, building on a recent history of stronger advertising privacy safeguards in its app store and contrasted with AI privacy mishaps from rivals, Apple appears positioned to gain brand interest and AI market share from its out-of-the-gate focus on strong privacy,\u201d analysts wrote.\nRosenblatt also highlighted Apple's strategic focus on specialized large language models (LLMs) and Apple silicon, which seems to protect the company from the cost pressures impacting other tech giants.\nShares in AI memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) fell after it released the latest quarterly results on Wednesday.\nCiti analysts attributed the decline to the company\u2019s conservative guidance and increased capital expenditure. However, they maintained a positive outlook, suggesting that investors should \u201cbuy MU on weakness as the DRAM upturn thesis remains intact and we expect sequentially higher revenue, EPS, and gross margins through C25.\u201d\nReflecting this view, Citi reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $175 for Micron stock, raising their fiscal 2024 earnings per share (EPS) estimate from $0.52 to $0.66.\nJPMorgan analysts shared a similar sentiment, expressing confidence in Micron\u2019s ability to capitalize on memory content demand driven by AI and accelerated compute server deployments. They noted that the company\u2019s HBM3e capacity is sold out through 2025 and is beginning to see demand for 2026.\n\u201cGross margins for HBM3e and eSSD are both accretive to their respective segments and we believe that should structurally augment their profitability profile in combination with cyclical demand/supply related pricing increases,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s analysts wrote.\n\u201cWe believe the stock should continue to outperform through 2024 and into 2025 as the market continues to discount improving revenue/margin/earnings power.\u201d\nJPMorgan reiterated an Overweight rating on Micron stock, setting a December 2025 price target of $180, and highlighted MU as \u201cone of our top picks in semis next year.\u201d\nEarlier this week, analysts at investment bank Stifel started research coverage on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) with a Buy rating and a price target of $265.00.\nThey believe Tesla is well-positioned for substantial growth over the next few years, particularly from 2025 to 2027. In the short term, the updated Model 3 and the forthcoming Model Y refresh are expected to boost sales. Further, the production of the next-generation Model 2 is anticipated to attract high demand.\n\u201cWe also believe TSLA's AI-based Full Self-Driving (FSD) initiative has the potential to generate significant value through sales of FSD, possible licensing agreements, and as a critical driver of longer-term RoboTaxi initiatives,\u201d Stifel analysts wrote.\nHowever, they also highlighted some near-term risks, including delivery levels after underwhelming first-quarter 2024 results, challenges in EV adoption, and uncertainties related to the U.S. election.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: Google downgraded as Apple gets vote of confidence\nRising trade policy uncertainty poses a downside risk to growth: Goldman Sachs\nExclusive-US prosecutors meeting with Boeing, crash victims as criminal charging decision looms, sources say\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 25, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Vistra Energy Corp. VST, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT and Macy's M.\nWith just a few trading days left, Wall Street has been on a remarkable rally, buoyed by a surge in technology stocks. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze, hopes of rate cuts, optimism over a resilient economy, improving corporate earnings and the rising share of the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been driving the space. Notably, the technology sector is the clear leader of the 2024 market rally so far.\nThe Nasdaq Composite emerged as an outperformer, gaining 17.8%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial have risen 14.6% and 3.9%, respectively. The strong trend is likely to continue in the second half as well.\nLet\u2019s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:\nThe AI boom will continue to fuel the rally in the broad market, with companies investing huge sums in the technology sector and beyond. The expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh growth opportunities. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030.\nAI is bolstering electricity demand, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. A simple ChatGPT task uses 10 times the energy a normal Google search does. So, data centers with a capacity of 30 megawatts are boosting capacity to handle 300 megawatts of power. This has made the traditional utilities sector of the market most appealing. Though technology seems to have become expensive, utilities remain an untapped area.\nInvestors seeking to make the most of the next leg in the AI industrial revolution should consider utility stocks. Vistra Energy Corp., having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the best-performing stocks of the first half. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 47 cents for this year over the past month, with an estimated growth rate of 13.7%. Vistra Energy has a Growth Score of B, indicating that it is poised for more growth. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is the biggest engine of growth for the technology sector and the S&P 500 as a whole. It now accounts for 31% of weightage in the S&P 500. The three stocks \u2014 NVIDIA, Apple and Microsoft \u2014 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group are in a race to become the world\u2019s most valuable company and hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion on surging enthusiasm over AI capabilities.\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of building AI into its products and services. Its success is largely attributed to its leadership in developing advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally catching up following the launch of the brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence at its recent Worldwide Developers Conference. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into AI in a bid to turbocharge its growth, particularly its cloud computing services, and is now reaping the fruits. About 65% of Fortune 500 companies are using the Azure service that delivers OpenAI's technology to businesses. Demand for generative AI will continue to fuel Microsoft's cloud business.\nApple and Microsoft have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.\nThe S&P 500 is on track to record its best first-half performance during an election year since 1976, as well as the second-best performance in an election year in its history, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The index has achieved multiple records and gained at least 500 points in the first six months. The index topped the 5,500 level for the first time last week after hitting the 5,400 threshold earlier this month and 5,300 last month, underscoring strong confidence. It broke the milestones of 5,100 and 5,200 in February.\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on the stock market. An analyst at Stifel expects the S&P 500 to reach the 6,000 mark before the end of 2024, up from just below 5,500, as investors keep piling in. This month, an analyst at Goldman boosted the year-end target price for the S&P 500 Index to 5,600 from 5,200 for the third time, citing an optimistic outlook for earnings growth and the U.S. economy.\nMeanwhile, Evercore ISI, one of the prominent bear analysts, turned bullish and raised its year-end S&P 500 price target from 4,750 to 6,000 \u2014 a new high on Wall Street. The analyst stated that the \"AI revolution is in the early innings\" and should lead to continued strength in earnings growth. Evercore ISI forecasts S&P 500 EPS growth of 8% and 5% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nMarket veteran Ed Yardeni expects the bull market to roar further until the end of this decade, with the S&P 500 on track to hit 6,000 by the end of 2025 and 8,000 by the end of the decade. Tom Lee, the founder of Fundstrat, expects that the S&P 500 could hit 15,000 by the end of this decade.\nIn the latest FOMC meeting, U.S. policymakers penciled in one rate cut for this year and foresee four cuts for 2025. The Fed altered language in its statement, noting there has been \u201cmodest further progress toward the committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective.\u201d Previously, the statement pointed to a \u201clack\u201d of further progress.\nLow rates reduce the cost of borrowing, which is often needed to finance the expansion of companies, thereby driving growth. This can positively impact sectors like real estate, consumer discretionary and financial services, which are typically sensitive to interest rate changes.\nIn real estate, lower rates can boost housing market activity by making mortgages more affordable. For consumer discretionary sectors, reduced borrowing costs can lead to increased consumer spending. In the financial sector, while lower rates can compress net interest margins for banks, they can also encourage lending and potentially lead to increased consumer and business loan activity.\nAs a result, investors could bet on any of these sectors to magnify gains for the rest of the year. In particular, the most beaten-down stocks of the first half could outperform in the second half. One exciting option could be Macy's, which sells a range of merchandise, such as apparel and accessories for men, women, and kids, cosmetics; home furnishings, and other consumer goods under the Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury brands.\nThe stock is down about 9% so far this year but has the potential to move higher in the second half of the year, given its Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. Additionally, Macy's saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending January 2025).\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

However, they rebounded when it became clear that his coalition would be able to form the government.\nOn Sunday, Modi was sworn in as India's prime minister for a third consecutive term. While there are concerns that it may be difficult at times for Modi to push through his agenda, investors appreciate having a business-friendly government in power.\nThe government retained key cabinet ministers in the important portfolios of finance, home, defense, and external affairs, suggesting policy continuity and that Modi remains firmly in control of the new coalition government.\nIndian stocks and ETFs have garnered significant interest from investors lately, as the country is emerging as a clear beneficiary of China's economic crisis. China's geopolitical tensions with the US and its Western allies have also encouraged large multinationals to explore alternatives to China.\nMany American companies are seeking to reduce their dependence on China. India boasts a large and highly skilled labor force, and the government is eager to attract more foreign investment.\nApple and Nvidia are among the high-profile companies expanding their presence in India.\nIndia remains the world's fastest-growing major economy. Its GDP rose 8.2% during the fiscal year that ended in March. Goldman Sachs predicts that India will become the world's second-largest economy by 2075.\nThe economic growth is driven mainly by domestic consumption and investments. The rising middle class and their growing incomes will continue to boost the economy.\nLast year, India overtook China as the world's most populous country, and its population is much younger than China's and most Western countries.\nThe country has undergone an impressive digital transformation in recent years, thanks to a combination of factors including growing internet penetration, the availability of ultra-low-cost smartphones and data plans, technological advancements, and the government's focus on building digital infrastructure.\nTo learn about the iShares MSCI India ETF, WisdomTree India Earnings Fund and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF, please watch the short video above.\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\nGet it free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Traditionally, cryptocurrency mining involves the use of powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, securing the blockchain network and validating transactions in the process. This activity, while essential, often requires significant technical expertise and substantial financial investment in hardware and energy consumption.\n\"Smart Mining\u201d is an innovative approach to regular crypto mining and it is designed to make cryptocurrency mining more accessible, efficient, and inclusive. BlockDAG Network has pioneered this concept with the launch of its X1 Miner App.\nThe principles of Smart Mining focus on accessibility, efficiency, and passive income generation. By integrating these principles into their app,\u00a0BlockDAG Network\u00a0aims to democratize the mining process, allowing anyone with a smartphone to participate and earn cryptocurrency without the need for expensive hardware or extensive technical knowledge.\nThe X1 Miner App also epitomizes the concept of \"on-the-go\" mining. This innovative application transforms any iOS or Android device into a portable mining rig, enabling users to mine BDAG coins from anywhere in the world. The app\u2019s user-friendly interface guides users through the setup process, making it easy for both beginners and experienced miners to start mining quickly.\nOne of the key benefits of using the X1 Miner App is the potential for daily passive income. By mining BDAG coins through the app, users can earn a steady return without having to actively manage their mining operations. This passive income stream can be a significant advantage for individuals looking to diversify their investment portfolio or generate additional revenue.\n\nWith the X1 Miner App now live on the Apple App Store and its imminent release on Google Play Store, BlockDAG Network invites everyone to join the Smart Mining revolution.
