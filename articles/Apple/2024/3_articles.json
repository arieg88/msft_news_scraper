        "Text": "Since it was founded in the 1970s, Apple has grown into a multinational and widely successful technology company. Best known for its iPhones, the company is also a popular choice for laptops, tablets, headphones and other products.\nLearn More: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead Next: Owe Money to the IRS? Most People Don\u2019t Realize They Should Do This One Thing\nBased on its past success, you might assume that Apple shares will continue to increase in the years to come. However, it\u2019s important to remember that past success doesn\u2019t always indicate future results. Here\u2019s a look at Apple\u2019s past, and some predictions as to what could drive the stock over the next five years.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nApple went public on December 12th, 1980, with a share price of $22. Since then, the company\u2019s stock has split five times. On a split-adjusted basis, the IPO price was only $0.10.\nEarlier this month, Apple reported positive results (revenue and earnings) from the December quarter but warned investors that they should expect some weakness. The biggest negative came when they announced revenue in China had declined 13% during the quarter due to increased handset competition. This caused the stock price to drop nearly 4%.\nThe past decade has been good overall for Apple investors. They\u2019ve watched the stock price go from roughly $18 per share all the way to its all-time high of $197.86 on December 13, 2023. It\u2019s pulled back to $180.10 (as of February 29, 2024), but long-term shareholders are profiting from their patience.\nTrending Now: If You Had Invested $10K in GameStop and AMC in 2021, Here\u2019s How Much You\u2019d Have Today\nIt\u2019s no secret that Apple has a loyal brand following. Those who choose iPhones or Macbooks typically don\u2019t veer off-course. It\u2019s that brand loyalty that\u2019s continued to boost revenue growth in recent years.\nPlus, with Apple\u2019s heavy investment in new entertainment content, more and more people are moving to things like Apple Music and Apple TV.\n\u201cWe\u2019re bullish on Apple\u2019s prospects for the next five years, especially with the iPhone potentially gaining ground against Android as the global economy trends toward higher incomes,\u201d said Deiya Pernas, Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and co-founder of Pernas Research. \u201cWe foresee Apple slightly outpacing global GDP growth over the next three to five years.\u201d\nNearly half of Apple\u2019s revenue is made up from iPhone sales. However, if you look at the flat sales numbers over recent quarters, it might be safe to say that the company\u2019s high growth period has passed.\nThis is mostly because iPhones already make up a large percentage of the world\u2019s cell phones, and people aren\u2019t upgrading nearly as often as they used to.\nSo where can investors look for continued revenue growth? Services and wearables.\nOne of Apple\u2019s biggest bright spots has been its services unit which makes up app sales and digital content. In the final three months of 2023, Apple reported a record $23.1 billion in revenue from the unit. This alone accounts for nearly one-third of Apple\u2019s gross profits.\nWhile it\u2019s tough to tell what might happen in the future, there should be some caution. Similar to saturation within the number of iPhones in the market, there will also be a limit on how much the average consumer is willing to spend on digital content. However, for today, services can be what the company needs to continue driving growth.\n\u201cIf Apple fails to keep up with innovation on their platform, like not advancing in AI to tailor experiences for iPhone users or not making strides in virtual reality, it could hurt their share prices,\u201d continued Pernas. \u201cPlus, there\u2019s the issue of supply chain risk; if Apple doesn\u2019t diversify its supply chains away from China \u2014 maybe continuing to emphasize India, for example \u2014 it could be a factor affecting their stock value.\u201d\nMost analysts who follow Apple predict that revenue will exceed $500 billion in the next several years. That could help push its $180 stock price up to close to $300 before the end of the decade. But, only time will tell.\n\u201cApple\u2019s intimate knowledge of its users, with our entire identities often wrapped up in our phones, presents a massive opportunity,\u201d said Pernas. \u201cIf they can leverage AI effectively to offer highly personalized experiences, that\u2019s a game-changer.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\nI'm a Shopping Expert: 9 Items I'd Never Put in My Grocery Cart\n5 Used Cars You Shouldn't Buy\nAvoid This Simple Banking Mistake That Could Cost You Over $1,000\n6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Will Your Apple Shares Be Worth in 5 Years?

        "Title": "Apple MacBook Air 2024 review: The best keeps getting better",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) MacBook Air is one of the best laptops on the market. From its stylish design to its powerful performance and long-lasting battery, it\u2019s hard to top what Apple has to offer. Well, except if you\u2019re looking for a Windows laptop.\nBut if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or are curious about switching to the other side, the MacBook Air is, generally, the way to go. And that\u2019s no different with the company\u2019s newest 15-inch variety. After spending a few days with the 2024 MacBook Air 15-inch, I can say it\u2019s better than ever. But it still has one nagging downside: a lack of connectivity ports on its right side.\nAvailable March 8, the latest Air lineup gets a processor bump from Apple\u2019s M2 processor to the newer M3. The smaller 13-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch starts at $1,299.\nBoth are available in a midnight color that features the same anodized seal that helps cut down on fingerprint smudges, something I wish my 2023 15-inch midnight MacBook Air had. I know it\u2019s not that big of a deal, but when you\u2019re spending north of $1,000 on something you touch every day, you want it to keep looking as clean as the day you bought it.\nMy review unit came equipped with Apple\u2019s 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU M3 chip, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage for $1,699. And if you\u2019re in the market for the 15-inch Air, that\u2019s the exact configuration I\u2019d recommend you buy. It\u2019ll get you enough performance to last a long time thanks to its 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage should be enough for a game here and there, as well as your photos and videos.\nIf you want to go all out, though, you can boost the memory to 24GB and storage to 2TB for $2,499. That said, for the same price, you could get a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a more powerful M3 Pro chip, 18GB of memory, and 512GB of storage.\nIf you want to do some basic photo and video editing and light gaming, stick with the Air. But if you\u2019re interested in heavy-duty photo and video work, gaming, and working on 3D modeling software, the Pro is the way to go.\nAs far as overall performance goes, Apple says the latest Air outpaces last year\u2019s model with 20% faster CPU performance than the M2 Air and 35% better performance than the M1-equipped model. Graphics also get a boost, with the M3 Air beating out the M2 and M1 models with 20% and 65% better performance, respectively.\nI\u2019m writing this review with the M3-powered Air, and I haven\u2019t seen any slowdown or hiccups. It opens apps quickly, springs to life when I lift the lid, and manages to run the game \u201cBaldur\u2019s Gate 3\u201d relatively well on low to medium graphics settings. It doesn\u2019t look as good as it would on, say, a dedicated gaming desktop or console, but if you\u2019re looking to toss fireballs at goblins on the go, the Air will get the job done.\nThe latest MacBook Airs also now support two external displays when you close their lids. So if you want to just use your Air as more or less a computing box and work off of those separate screens and a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse, you can do just that. Disconnect your Air from the setup and you can get going with ease.\nBattery life is as fantastic as you\u2019d expect from an Air running on one of Apple\u2019s chips. The company says it managed to ring out 18 hours of battery life from the Air while playing back 1080p video via iTunes. I\u2019ve used this review unit to write, browse the web, check out some video games, and more, and the battery never touched the red line.\nOf course, I kept recharging it every time I sat down at my makeshift workstation in my apartment\u2019s kitchen/living room/dining room area, but when I did take it for a spin to another room, I never felt the need to bring a charger with me.\nOne of the things that stands out about the M3-powered MacBook Air is the way Apple is positioning it as an AI machine. The company refers to the Air as the \u201cworld\u2019s best consumer laptop for AI,\u201d thanks to the M3\u2019s built-in neural engine. It\u2019s important to note that Apple has included neural engines in its chips for quite some time already, so the neural engine in the M3 isn\u2019t exactly some kind of new development.\nIt\u2019s more that by highlighting it, Apple is telling the world that it\u2019s been building AI-capable laptops, desktops, and smartphones for years, while Windows laptops are only just beginning to embrace AI via Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Copilot and AI-enabled chips from Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) on or coming to market this year.\nMy only real critique of the MacBook Air is that it only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports on its left side. It seems like a minor complaint, but having the ports, which are compatible with rounded USB-C connectors, on only one side can make cable management difficult, especially if you\u2019re used to having a connector on your system\u2019s right side. I had to rearrange my home setup to get comfortable with my review unit, for instance.\nOverall, Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Air builds on the success of its prior offerings and continues to carry the torch as one of the best laptops you can buy. If you\u2019ve already got an M1 or M2-powered Air, you\u2019re fine holding on to your unit for a while longer. If you\u2019re still working with an Intel-based Air, though, it\u2019s time to ditch that dinosaur for an Air with one of Apple\u2019s chips.\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Apple is continuing to offer last year\u2019s 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip at a starting price of $999. You don\u2019t get the slick fingerprint-reducing paint job or the ability to use two external monitors, but it\u2019s still a fantastic laptop.\nIf you\u2019d rather grab an M3-powered MacBook Air, though, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "'Apple will prevail': US faces uphill slog in new antitrust battle",
        "Author": " Alexis Keenan    \u00b7 Senior Legal Reporter",
        "Text": "Attorney General Merrick Garland made a bold statement last week when he announced a new antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL): \"The United States normally wins the cases that it brings.\"\nBut not all legal experts agree that federal prosecutors hold the upper hand in a legal battle that aims to dismantle the architecture of Apple\u2019s marquee product, the iPhone.\n\"My guess is [Apple] will win,\" University of Chicago law professor Randy Picker told Yahoo Finance Live.\nEven if Apple does not prevail in the New Jersey federal court where the case was filed, Picker expects the tech giant to succeed on appeals, possibly to the Supreme Court.\n\"Yes, I think that Apple will prevail in the end.\"\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several confrontations between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\nThe Justice Department is also suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) \u2014 alleging they also violate antitrust laws.\nThe case against Apple is the widest-ranging of these tech antitrust suits. The Justice Department alleges that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.\nThe tech giant last week called the suit a threat to the very principles that set the company apart from its rivals and characterized the government\u2019s legal theory as a dubious one with legal claims that were wrong on the facts and the law.\nIn broad terms, the government alleges Apple must open up the iPhone operating system so that it becomes easier for non-Apple businesses to add and run their own products \u2014 including digital wallets, smartwatches, messaging apps, super apps, and cloud streaming apps \u2014 on the iPhone.\nApple said forcing it to open up the iPhone\u2019s ecosystem would ultimately harm consumers by hampering its ability to design \"the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect.\"\nCentral to that design, the company said, are privacy, security, and safety features that give users high levels of personal and financial data protection.\nHarvard Kennedy School adjunct cybersecurity policy lecturer Bruce Schneier said that if Apple does a good job of making the security argument, \"I think they win.\"\nBut there is a potential weakness to that argument. The iPhone's security protection, he said, is attributable to the company\u2019s business model and not to the phone's design.\n\"Apple does have more security because they don't spy on people for a living,\" Schneier said. \"They make the money on devices and electronics.\"\nWhat's more, the iPhone and a rival smartphone like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel offer similar security features, according to Schneier.\n\"Don\u2019t be confused in thinking that security is an end in itself. It furthers the goal of profits.\"\nSome argue the government has a strong case.\n\"I think it\u2019s very well pleaded,\" said New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox, who pointed out that the DOJ claims to have evidence of Apple\u2019s deliberate steps to block competition and cut out options for consumers.\nThere is no doubt, however, that the government has some challenges to overcome.\nOne is that judges are typically restrained from ordering companies to change the way they run their business, according to Boston College of Law antitrust professor David Olson.\nTo overcome those limits, Olson said, the government is alleging that the iPhone falls into a category of products so essential to life that they get special treatment under antitrust law.\nUnless the government proves the iPhone is an \"essential facility,\" Olson explained, Apple has autonomy to make their products how they want.\nAnother challenge for the US government is that it must adequately identify Apple as a monopolist in a particular market.\nThe market of choice in this case is the smartphone market; Apple holds roughly 70% of the US smartphone market and 20% of the global market.\nThen it must address a critical question: \"What have you done with your monopoly that\u2019s problematic?\u201d Picker said.\nThe government\u2019s answer is that Apple\u2019s design of the iPhone is illegal because it works most optimally with its own apps and products \u2014 like iWatch, iMessage, Wallet, and the App Store. That, in turn, makes it difficult for customers to switch to a non-Apple device.\nOne potential advantage for Apple is that it has successfully argued in other court cases that it maintains tight control over its ecosystem to protect consumers rather than harm them.\nIn fact, the arguments Apple surfaced last week echoed those it made in a private antitrust case brought in 2020 by the developer of the mega-popular gaming app \u201cFortnite,\u201d Epic Games.\nIt was a case that Apple mostly won.\nA federal district court judge in California and a three-judge appellate court panel in San Francisco ruled that Epic failed to show Apple held a monopoly in either of the disputed markets at issue: the mobile-game transactions market or the markets for iOS app distribution and in-app payment solutions.\nThe Justice Department has made some compelling claims in its new suit against Apple, Olson said, but he doubts that under scrutiny they will hold up as antitrust law violations.\n\"It gives us a litany of practices that DOJ argues make consumers and developers worse off,\" Olson said, but the harder question is whether those practices are merely a list of what Apple could do to make things better for developers or customers.\n\"It's usually a pretty hard case to say that someone has to, because of antitrust law, change the way they are running their company.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the names of Bruce Schneier and David Olson.

If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.\"\nA victory for the US in this case \"would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology,\" Apple added in its statement.\nApple's stock fell more than 4% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.\nThe filing sets up yet another confrontation between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\nThe Department of Justice is suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) alleging they also violate antitrust laws.\nThe new DOJ lawsuit filed Thursday poses a major new threat to Apple's various revenue streams.\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\nThe DOJ's suit comes just weeks after the European Commission (EC) fined Apple $2 billion for allegedly breaking competition laws in the bloc. The EC alleged the company illegally wielded its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\nThe Justice Department suit is just the latest headache for Apple, which is off to a rough start in 2024.\nShares of Apple are down 7% year to date as the company struggles with slowing iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market. Apple also lost its title as the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).\nAt the center of the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit is the iPhone, Apple\u2019s most recognizable product.\nThe company harms consumers by making it more difficult for iPhone users to switch to a competing product and to access competing services, according to the government. The complaint also says Apple harms app developers by imposing restrictions on app creation and distribution.\nThat includes everything from text messaging to digital wallets to apps that reduce user dependence on the iPhone.\nGarland, for example, characterized Apple\u2019s iMessage as anti-competitive, saying that when it is used to text with a Google Android device, the iPhone user\u2019s response is in green rather than blue.\nThat, he said, \"limits functionality.\" The videos sent via text, Garland added, can also be pixelated and grainy.\nHe then quoted Apple\u2019s CEO responding to a complaint from a user who said he couldn\u2019t send his mom certain videos: \"'Buy your mom an iPhone.'\"\nApple, the suit alleges, also makes it more difficult for smartphone users to access competing digital wallets by blocking developers from using tap-to-pay functionality in their apps. And it prevents the Apple Watch from working with Android smartphones while making it more difficult for someone with an iPhone to use a rival\u2019s smartwatch.\n\"Apple repeatedly responded to competitive threats,\" said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, \"by making it harder to leave, then making it more attractive to stay. The antitrust laws have something to say about that.\"\nApple, according to the suit, also suppresses cloud streaming gaming apps and denies consumers access to so-called super apps, which allow users access to a broad range of functionalities from a single interface.\nThe wide-ranging suit is \"about the core unfair practices of Apple,\" Case Western Reserve University antitrust expert and law professor Anat Alon-Beck said.\n\"Apple systematically excludes rivals from the Apple ecosystem. By doing that, Apple is hurting so many startup businesses, stakeholders, customers, and, in my opinion, its shareholders.\"\nAs a result, she predicts that Apple's stock will \"see more downward movement.\"\nThis is just the latest antitrust battle Apple has had to contend with in the US.\nThe last was in 2020, when \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games sued the company and accused it of violating antitrust law by prohibiting third-party app developers from offering their own payment methods within their apps \u2014as opposed to using Apple's payment service.\nJustice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in that high-stakes dispute. It focused attention on Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 the only place consumers can download apps for iPhones and iPads, which generally charges app developers a 30% commission on paid app purchases made through the platform.\nApple scored a victory in that case when the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.\nHowever, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for users to pay for purchases.\nBoth companies tried to take their fight to the Supreme Court, though the high court declined to take up either appeal.\nFollowing that decision, Apple said it will allow developers to offer third-party payment options through their apps. However, the company said developers would still have to pay fees of either 12% or 27%, a move Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called \"anticompetitive.\"\nApple is in the midst of reconfiguring its App Store payment system in the European Union. Under the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company must allow EU customers the option to download third-party app stores and get access to third-party payment options.\nApple said it would address the measure and allow third-party downloads and payments, but will still charge developers a fee of 50 euro cents for each download if they cross the 1 million download threshold in a year.\nBoth Epic and Spotify objected to the measure, with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek calling the new rule \"hostile.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the names of Anat Alon-Beck and Jonathan Kanter.

        "Title": "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Allow Nvidia to Crush Apple and Microsoft, and Become the Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock?",
        "Author": "  Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the hottest player in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most important hardware element of the servers that run advanced AI applications.\nIn the particularly high-margin category of GPUs tailored to run AI and other accelerated computing applications, Nvidia currently commands roughly 90% of the market. While competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are making moves to ramp up their capabilities in the ultra-high-performance GPU space, many analysts expect Nvidia to retain its incredible strength in the category.\nWith incredible performances behind it and management guiding for further explosive growth, Nvidia stock has risen by 240% over the last year and is up 82% so far in 2024.\nThese gains have pushed Nvidia's market cap to roughly $2.27 trillion. It now ranks as the world's third-most valuable company and the third-most valuable member of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Apple, currently sitting in second place, has a market cap of $2.65 trillion, while top dog Microsoft is valued at approximately $3.12 trillion.\nCould Nvidia soon be the world's most valuable company?\nStarting late in 2022, incredible leaps forward in artificial intelligence technologies began to emerge at a rapid pace. That progress ramped up dramatically in 2023, and it has shown no sign of slowing down this year.\nAs businesses and institutions have made moves to gain exposure to the AI space, demand has soared for Nvidia's most advanced processors. Its sales and earnings have shot through the roof.\nIn last year's fourth quarter, the company's sales grew 265% year over year to $22.16 billion. Thanks to dramatic performance acceleration in 2023's second half, Nvidia's annual sales increased by 126% to $60.9 billion.\nNvidia posted $29.76 billion in net income last year -- equal to 49% of its total sales. That's an incredible net income margin for a hardware-oriented business; those often have lower margins compared to software-oriented businesses due to the higher incremental costs associated with producing physical goods.\nBut the company's incredible margins reflect just how highly in demand its GPUs are right now. It's reasonable to expect that Nvidia's incredible growth will moderate, but the business looks poised to grow at a much faster rate than Apple and Microsoft for the next few years at least.\nApple and Microsoft still generate far more revenue and net income than Nvidia. On the other hand, the chip powerhouse looks well positioned to continue being the biggest winner in the AI revolution, and has been growing at a far faster rate than those larger tech giants.\nFor comparison, Microsoft\u00a0 grew its sales roughly by 10% over the trailing-12-month period and increased its net income by 20%. Meanwhile, Apple's revenue was flat across that stretch, though its net income rose by 7%.\nIf demand for AI services continues to rise dramatically, there's a good chance that Nvidia will surpass Apple's market cap and take the title of world's most valuable company from Microsoft within the next five years. While the GPU leader's business has historically been shaped by cyclical trends, it still appears to be in the early stages of benefiting from the unfolding AI revolution.\nRight now, Nvidia is benefiting from the emergence of an unprecedented new technology -- and that means forecasting its performance over the next five years involves a heavy dose of speculation. But given its incredible sales and earnings momentum and the overall market excitement for artificial intelligence applications, it wouldn't be shocking to see Nvidia claim the title of world's most valuable business.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple Inc. is the second most valuable company in the world, approaching a $3 trillion market capitalization. Roughly 64% of Americans own an Apple product, meaning the company has massive amounts of data, and control, over the lives of hundreds of millions of people. But, the company also acts as a gatekeeper to the millions of businesses that use the Apple platform, giving it considerable control over businesses around the world.\nFor example, Apple charges a 30% fee on nearly every transaction for digital goods on the Apple app store.\u00a0 If you buy digital currency, game skins, movies or any other digital product on the Apple App Store, you are subject to this 30% fee. This has caused many of the largest names in the world to cut or amend their pricing to all because of this massive fee.\nDon't Miss:\nWealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.\nNew homebuilding startup could be in the right place at the right time to shock real estate market \u2013 and it sells for $5 per share.\nIn 2018, Netflix Inc. halted all new subscriptions using Apple's App Store billing as the giant wanted a 30% cut and wouldn't let new users transact outside of Apple. After regulatory pressures and lawsuits, Apple eventually allowed Netflix users to circumvent the 30% fee by directing them to the Netflix website. Netflix subscribers haven't been able to subscribe to Netflix using the App Store billing since 2018, but many remained on their pre-2018 plans, meaning Apple took their fees. Last month, Netflix announced it would be forcing some users to change their billing method away from the App Store or risk their accounts being closed.\nAmazon.com Inc. went through a similar issue with its Prime Video services, before cutting a deal to integrate with AppleTV to avoid the hefty fee.\nOne of the most outspoken critics of this policy is Fortnite creator and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Sweeney, an outspoken Apple critic for years, recently sued the tech giant. The company sells billions of dollars in digital goods per year on Fortnite, meaning the company pays millions in fees for those who play the game on mobile devices. Despite attempts to circumvent the issue, Apple has maintained a strong grip on Epic and others.\nTrending:\nFortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\nThis startup coined \u201ceBay for gamers\u201d with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\nThe legal battle has continued on several fronts. The European Union recently passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to help level the playing field for people like Epic against Apple. Epic planned to launch a competitor to the App Store, which resulted in Epic Games's developer account being banned. After some challenges under the DMA from the EU, Apple reinstated the account shortly after.\nWhile this led to Sweeney touting the battle as \"victory\" on X, it led Y Combinator Co-Founder Paul Graham to comment with a larger question: Is Apple evil?\nGraham's post stated, \"Apple just terminated Epic\u2019s developer account, and they admitted that this tweet was one of the reasons. We don\u2019t want to think about Apple being evil. It would be so inconvenient. We don\u2019t want to switch to Android. But I see ever more signs that power has corrupted them.\"\nThe post in question was from Sweeney stating:\nApple leadership faces some massive decisions in the coming weeks as the contradictions between their stated principles and the intended and actual consequences of their present policies are reckoned with: the app store monopoly, the digital goods payments monopoly, the tax, the suppression of true information about competing purchasing options, the blocking of competing web browser engines and outright destruction of web apps. It doesn't have to be this way. Apple is a few bold and visionary decisions away from being the company they once were and that they still advertise themselves to be: beloved brand to consumers, partner to developers and overlord to none.\"\nMany find it concerning that, despite the massive resources Epic Games has at its disposal Apple is still able to assert incredible control over the multibillion-dollar corporation.\nWhile corporations increasingly aren't fond of Apple, consumers love the brand. The average American owns 2.6 Apple products, with the majority of Americans having a favorable perception of the brand.\nRead Next:\nOne startup funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and Homeland Security aims to solve this specific nuisance in a spectacular fashion, and you can invest in it today.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article 'We Don't Want To Think About Apple Being Evil,' Says Y Combinator Founder Paul Graham After Tech Giant Terminates Epic Games Developer Account Over Founder's Critical Tweets originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Apple Inc. is constantly looking for new and innovative ways to spend its $73 billion war chest. From the Vision Pro to the Apple Car, it's rolling out new products and producing the next generation of consumer technology. Last week, it was reported that its decade-long Apple Car project is coming to an end. But it looks like the trillion-dollar titan has a new focus: artificial intelligence.\nIn a bold move toward integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its ecosystem, Apple is setting the stage to unveil a series of generative AI-based tools at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. This initiative, part of iOS 18, signifies a significant leap in Apple\u2019s AI strategy, showcasing a new version of Siri enhanced with generative AI capabilities. The upgrade promises a range of new functionalities, aiming to revolutionize user interactions with Apple devices\u200b\u200b.\nDon't Miss:\nThis startup coined \u201ceBay for gamers\u201d with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\nThis $0.25 per share Boston startup is fixing a glaring problem with today's online advertising and is currently crowdfunding.\nApple\u2019s AI ambitions extend beyond Siri. The company is reportedly planning to introduce an AI-based tool for completing lines of software code, akin to Microsoft Corp.\u2018s Copilot. Microsoft continues to be a magnate in the AI space. It has invested billions in OpenAI in a profit-sharing agreement that has also helped power the company's suite of AI-based tools.\nThis tool, expected to be integrated into Apple\u2019s Xcode software, could simplify the development process by automatically completing code blocks, potentially transforming how developers work on the Apple platform. In addition to code completion, Apple is exploring AI features for automating Apple Music playlists and enhancing its business presentation software. These advancements indicate Apple\u2019s broader goal to infuse AI across its product range, enhancing user experience and productivity\u200b\u200b.\nTrending: Peter Thiel, Mark Cuban and Warren Buffett funded early-stage startups and made millions. You don't need to be a well-connected billionaire to do the same.\nApple\u2019s approach to AI development is characterized by strategic partnerships and technological innovation. The company has been in talks with major publishers for rights to train its generative AI systems using their content, aiming for multiyear agreements. This step underscores Apple\u2019s commitment to refining its AI capabilities through access to vast data sets, ensuring that its AI tools are both powerful and informed by a wide range of information sources\u200b\u200b.\nA technical breakthrough has also been reported, with Apple AI researchers developing a method to deploy large language models (LLMs) on iPhones and other devices with limited memory. This innovation could bring sophisticated AI functionalities directly into the pockets of millions of users, overcoming previous constraints related to device capabilities. Such advancements highlight Apple\u2019s focus on not just integrating AI into its devices but doing so in a way that is accessible and seamless for everyday use\u200b\u200b.\nAs Apple gears up for these AI-driven enhancements, the anticipation grows not only among its user base but also within the broader tech community. The upcoming WWDC is poised to be a landmark event, potentially setting new standards for AI integration in consumer technology. Apple\u2019s strategic investments in AI research and development, coupled with its efforts to ensure ethical and responsible use of AI, reflect a vision that extends beyond mere technological leadership. The company aims to redefine the intersection of AI and user experience, promising a future where Apple devices are not just tools but intelligent companions in the digital age.\nRead Next:\nOne startup funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and Homeland Security aims to solve this specific nuisance in a spectacular fashion, and you can invest in it today.\nFortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Apple's Launching A Futuristic Siri And Apple-Based Artificial Intelligence As It Looks To Take On Microsoft's AI Dominance originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Who needs an expensive, low-margin electric vehicle when you have ambiguous hopes for AI?\nAfter an ill-fated, decade-long odyssey, Apple has said goodbye to its car project and will redirect resources to its artificial intelligence division. A blow to all who longed to see exactly which generation Fiat 500 Jony Ive would have paid homage to.\nIf the decision was an admission of defeat \u2014 Elon Musk responded to the news on X with an emoji of a salute and a cigarette \u2014 it didn't feel like one. The collective response from several analysts and the market was something close to \"good riddance.\"\nScuttling the multibillion-dollar insurgent effort will allow Cupertino to focus on a broad AI strategy within the Apple ecosystem, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\nOthers have pointed to the way Apple's software and intuitive design have already reshaped the car industry through CarPlay, software that connects iPhones to cars, effectively transforming other companies' hardware into extensions of its walled garden.\nAnd leaving the automotive ambitions in the software realm means never having a 3,000-pound dented, muddy, and \u2014 most of all \u2014 rusty product sullying the world's cleanest brand on the road. Or on a lawn. As long as the updates keep coming it will be forever new.\nApple took so long to walk away from the expensive gamble that the tardiness looks like timeliness. New entrants have upped the competition in the electric vehicle market, sparking price wars and squeezing margins.\nEven Tesla, the EV king whose anti-Detroit rebellion inspired Apple's vehicular ambitions, has hit roadblocks. Slowing demand projected in 2024 has darkened the company's outlook. And without Big Tech's sprawling operations that span multiple sectors, Tesla has fewer business lines to rely on. The stock is down nearly 20% so far this year. As improbable as Tesla\u2019s rise has been, its long-term success still hinges on largely unproven autonomous technology.\nThe astonishing growth of Magnificent Seven winners, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft (MSFT), further presses the question of why Apple would chase Tesla when the early days of developing AI tools have been so promising.\nMusk's recent fuss over unlocking Tesla's AI potential makes Apple's car exit even more compelling. CEO Tim Cook already has multiple conduits for intimate data gathering and platforms for refining AI tools. Musk's vehicles are parked outside; Cook's screens tuck you in at night.\nBut there's something too on the nose and a little bleak about the world's most valuable company shuffling staff from its daring EV project to the trend of the moment, pursuing a more dazzling version of ChatGPT, or finding immersive ways to sink users more deeply into their couch. You'd think the phrase \"If you can't beat em, join em\" shouldn't apply to an enterprise packing hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at a problem.\nAt the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Cook said Apple will share details of its new AI features later this year. It's still not clear how AI will resuscitate Apple's growth story. But at least now we know where it won't come from.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) is in the midst of what you could generously call a \u201cdifficult\u201d period. The company is contending with a high-profile antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, falling iPhone sales in China, and a regulatory investigation in the European Union. And those are just the headlines from the past week.\nThe company is also still facing a shortfall when it comes to generative AI capabilities. And while it\u2019s widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI offering during its WWDC developer event on June 10, it\u2019ll need to have quite an impressive showing if it\u2019s going to catch up to its Big Tech rivals including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\nAll of that is hurting Apple\u2019s stock price. Shares of the iPhone maker have fallen more than 7% since the start of the year and are up just 6.25% over the last 12 months. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, are up 14% year to date and 49% over the last 12 months. Google? Shares of the search giant are up 9% year to date and 43% in the last 12 months.\nSuffice it to say, Apple\u2019s 2024 is not going well.\nApple\u2019s latest headache came Tuesday, when Bloomberg, citing Chinese government data, reported that iPhone shipments fell 33% year over year in the country in February.\nChina is Apple\u2019s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the region accounted for $72.6 billion of Apple\u2019s $383.3 billion in total revenue. That\u2019s roughly 19% of the company\u2019s sales.\nAnd this isn\u2019t exactly out of the blue. Earlier this month, Counterpoint Research reported that iPhone sales fell 24% year over year through the first six weeks of 2024 in the country. Overall smartphone unit sales in China declined 7% during the same period.\nApple has been aggressively expanding in China for years, but a resurgent Huawei and difficult economic conditions in the country are squeezing device sales. The company isn\u2019t just sitting idly by, though. Last week, CEO Tim Cook flew to China for the opening of the company\u2019s latest flagship store in Shanghai. He also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing and was expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, Apple-authorized retailers are also trying to goose sales, cutting the price of the company\u2019s latest iPhones in the hopes that it will get consumers to start buying again. However, it might take more than lower prices to make that happen.\nOutside of Apple\u2019s China sales drama, the company is also facing its long-anticipated antitrust fight with the Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which the DOJ filed last Thursday, accuses Apple of illegally maintaining dominance over the premium smartphone market by pushing aside competing apps and devices.\nThe Justice Department claims that Apple imposes restrictions on app developers, makes it difficult for users to switch to competing platforms, and hinders cloud gaming and so-called super apps that allow users to access multiple smaller apps from one larger platform.\nApple, however, is fighting back, saying in a statement that the suit \"threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.\"\nThe DOJ is seeking to force Apple to change its business practices, which could mean giving third-party apps greater access to the company\u2019s platforms and requiring Apple to expand compatibility with third-party device makers.\nThe lawsuit could also prove to be a dangerous distraction for Apple similar to how Microsoft\u2019s antitrust battle in the 90\u2019s stole executives\u2019 attention away from emerging technologies like smartphones. If Microsoft hadn\u2019t been so invested in its antitrust fight at the time, there\u2019s a good chance it would have seen the smartphone age coming as did Apple and Google, and launched its own line of handsets.\nIn addition to slowing iPhone sales in China and the DOJ\u2019s antitrust suit, the European Union\u2019s competition watchdog, the European Commission on Monday, announced that it is looking into whether Apple is in compliance with the bloc\u2019s Digital Markets Act.\nIn a statement released Monday, the Commission said it is investigating Apple\u2019s new app fee structure in the EU as well as whether it meets user choice obligations related to default apps and the ability to delete preinstalled apps.\nThe Digital Markets Act requires Apple to open up the iPhone to third-party app stores, enabling developers to get around the 30% and 15% fees the company charges for sales through its own App Store. While Apple said it will allow those third-party stores, the company said it will also charge developers a 50 euro cent Core Technology Fee per install per year on apps that have been installed more than 1 million times in the last 12 months.\nIn a statement, the EC said it is looking into whether Apple\u2019s new fees defeat the purpose of the obligations of the Digital Markets Act.\nWhile Apple is certainly facing a slew of challenges, it\u2019s far from down and out. It\u2019s still the second-richest company in the world by market capitalization \u2014 behind Microsoft \u2014 and it\u2019s sure to continue to sell millions of devices and services subscriptions throughout the year ahead.\nStill, for the foreseeable future, Apple could be in for a bumpy ride.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "The Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL) could have major consequences for the iPhone maker\u2019s business segments. If the DOJ wins, the company could be forced to give third-party companies greater access to iPhone features including Apple Wallet, improve compatibility with competing devices, and even allow third-party app stores on iOS.\nBut the DOJ will have a difficult time proving that Apple has broken antitrust laws, and even if it does prevail to some degree, the company will likely appeal the case all the way to the Supreme Court.\nIn the end, Apple may make some concessions, but the DOJ\u2019s suit is unlikely to significantly uproot the company\u2019s overall business. But that wouldn\u2019t mean Apple is out of the woods. The antitrust action could hold greater dangers for the company than giving users access to different app stores or ending the green-versus-blue text bubble debate.\nIt could ultimately hurt the company\u2019s ability to capture the next wave of tech innovation, just as Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) antitrust suit in the late 1990s gobbled up executives\u2019 resources and cost that company its chance to dominate the smartphone market.\nThe tech industry is in the throes of a massive upheaval thanks to the generative AI explosion. Microsoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is now the wealthiest public company in the world by market cap, pushing Apple to second place.\nNvidia is riding an incredible wave of success with revenue skyrocketing on sales of its AI chips, and seemingly every company in Silicon Valley and beyond is talking about how it\u2019s implementing generative AI to one degree or another.\nApple is widely expected to dive into the arena with the debut of its own generative AI capabilities at its WWDC developer conference in June. That\u2019s not all, though. Apple is also working through the continued development and support of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset, which it hopes will serve as a new form of computing.\nBut antitrust suits are long, time-consuming affairs that can eat up executives\u2019 time, pulling them away from important business decisions.\n\u201cIf the company believes that virtual reality is the next generation of computing after the smartphone \u2026 they really need to focus at the C-suite on that,\u201d explained Harvard Business School professor Andy Wu. \u201cBut this case is enough to really substitute their time away from focusing on the future. So that's one risk.\u201d\nThere\u2019s some precedent for this line of thinking. Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates famously blamed the distraction caused by his company\u2019s antitrust battle with the DOJ for its failure to break into, and capture, the smartphone market. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2001, opening up Windows to competing web browsers and services.\nMicrosoft eventually launched its own Windows Phone, even going as far as acquiring Nokia for $7.2 billion, but it failed to catch on and the company decided to focus on its cloud business instead.\nDeepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster says that while he doesn\u2019t believe the antitrust case will prove to be a major distraction for Apple\u2019s ability to innovate, it\u2019s certainly a threat.\n\u201cIf [Apple doesn\u2019t] innovate then they're going to lose and it's not about the DOJ; the DOJ would have been the distraction factor,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.\nA protracted legal battle could also damage Apple\u2019s carefully crafted public image.\n\u201cThe question is, how far and how hard is Apple [going to] fight some of this stuff, and in the process, do they risk \u2026 hurting the tremendous goodwill that they have?\u201d said TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell. \u201cI think that's something that they need to think about.\u201d\nApple has built up a powerful following around the world thanks to its top-notch hardware quality, easy-to-use software, and customer service. But a lengthy legal fight and negative headlines could jeopardize that.\nYes, Apple is one of the world\u2019s largest electronics companies with a growing services business. And sure, the iPhone is one of the most iconic devices ever built, but consumer sentiment can change overnight, and that could certainly prove problematic for Apple.\nThe DOJ\u2019s antitrust suit is still in its earliest stages, and Apple is sure to fight it as aggressively as possible. And while it\u2019s weathered major storms before, including regulatory fights in the European Union, there\u2019s no guarantee the company will come away from this battle unscathed.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "There are just five U.S. companies with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. These five companies, along with Tesla and Meta, make up the group known as the Magnificent Seven. To give you a sense of their scale, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s total market cap is larger than the entire Chinese stock market, and over four times the size of the total U.K. market.\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead Next: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024\nApple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are competitors, although perhaps not as directly as they once were \u2014 remember the \u2018I\u2019m a PC\u2019 commercials? Investors that have held either, or both, stocks over the years have been richly rewarded. There\u2019s no doubt that these two are among the most successful companies ever, but which one is the better investment in 2024?\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nTejas Dessai, AVP and research analyst at GlobalX ETFs, said that both stocks are very well positioned this year, but also acknowledged that there are some risks.\n\u201cApple clearly has a growth problem,\u201d Dessai said. \u201cThe iPhone business is pretty mature, China presents major headwinds and the company is viewed as a late entrant to artificial intelligence. But valuation is quite attractive, and the services and wearables business could continue to cut deeper. Meanwhile Microsoft is in a remarkable position to grow utilizing AI as a tailwind, but we think valuation is quite rich at this point and the immediate upside could be limited.\u201d\nSee More: Warren Buffett Sold His Apple Stock \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nWinner: Microsoft\nA company\u2019s ability to grow its earnings over time is an important factor in its suitability as an investment, so knowing whether Apple or Microsoft is likely to grow faster will be a key consideration. Dessai isn\u2019t the only one concerned with Apple\u2019s growth prospects. The analyst consensus growth rate over the next five years for Apple is 11% per year, the lowest five-year growth rate of any Magnificent Seven stock. Compare that to Microsoft\u2019s consensus growth rate of 16.3% and it\u2019s clear which company is better positioned to grow in the near to mid term.\nWinner: Apple\nWhile growth potential is important when evaluating a potential investment, valuation is equally if not more important. At the end of the day, price is what determines your return on investment, meaning even the very best companies can be a bad investment if you overpay.\nOne of the most common ratios used to measure valuation of publicly traded stocks is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. The higher the ratio, the more richly a stock is being valued. As Dessai noted, Microsoft is trading at a higher multiple. Its trailing 12-month P/E ratio is 36.76, while Apple is trading at a ratio of 26.51, significantly lower. In simple terms what this means is that Microsoft must grow earnings much faster than Apple to achieve a similar return on investment.\nWinner: Apple\nUnderstanding a company\u2019s financial strength is a good way to help you know how risky of an investment the stock will be. While both Apple and Microsoft are massive companies and enjoy the financial stability that comes with size, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re on equal footing. There are a million ways to measure financial strength, so it can be helpful to pick a measure that incorporates multiple factors. One such measure is the Piotroski F-score, named after its creator, Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski.\nThe F-score looks at nine different metrics to assign a score between zero and nine. Scores of eight and nine are considered strong. Microsoft currently rates an F-score of seven, which is solid if not spectacular. Apple, however, receives an eight, indicating better overall fundamentals as a business.\nObviously, as members of the Magnificent Seven, both Apple and Microsoft are outstanding businesses, and investors are unlikely to have a bad result investing in either. Right now, though, Apple appears to be the top choice to invest in based on the underlying fundamentals and cheaper valuation.\nHowever, things can change quickly in the stock market, so be sure to review your investments on a regular basis to make sure you feel good about continuing to hold them.\nIt may also be worth your while to consider other investment options. Given the incredible run that the Magnificent Seven have been on over the last few years, there is a legitimate question of how long they can continue to outperform on that level. The tide may already be going out \u2014 Tesla, for example, is trading around $175, well below its 2023 high of almost $300 per share.\n\u201cBoth [Microsoft and Apple] remain remarkable bets in the long run as we witness a moment of mass disruption unfold with AI,\u201d Dessai noted. \u201cBut chances are most investors are also significantly exposed to both the names through their core S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 exposure. We think growth in 2024 is going to favor companies benefiting from investments going into artificial intelligence, and we\u2019d suggest investors look at non-Magnificent Seven stocks to capture maximum upside.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\nDownsizing for Retirement?

        "Text": "After climbing 48% in 2023, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed so far in 2024. The stock is down about 11% year to date, in part, due to worries regarding slowing iPhone sales in China. However, one Wall Street analyst sees this price dip as a buying opportunity.\nEarlier this week, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan renewed his $225 price target on the stock. That price target represents a potential upside of about 31% in the next 12 months or so over the current share price of $171.\nA recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that iPhone sales in China fell 24% year over year in the first six weeks of the year. This seems to be what is weighing on the stock right now, but Mohan noted that Apple has an important option for dealing with this.\nApple does an effective job of lowering the prices of its older phones to maintain steady demand, according to Mohan. The analyst also says Apple's long-term trend of shifting customers toward higher-value units can help offset weak sales in China. China generated 21% of Apple's operating profit last quarter.\nChina sales are getting the blame for the stock's recent performance, but the shares were due for a correction. The stock traded at a high price-to-earnings ratio of 32 at the end of 2023 and now trade at a more reasonable P/E of 27, which is still higher than the market average.\nDespite weakness in China, Apple's earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, mostly driven by growing revenue in the higher-margin services category, and the company's ongoing share repurchases.\nIt might take a while for the market to come around, but Apple has plenty of strengths outside of China to deliver returns to investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) investors, with the company's share price down about 7% year to date, compared to the roughly 9% gain the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced during the same period.\nCommonly cited reasons for the disappointing start to the year have been fears of lower demand in China, potentially falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, regulatory pressures and low growth.\nJordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, sees another major risk on the horizon, warning that things could get worse for Apple.\nDon't Miss:\nUS military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here\u2019s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.\nFortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\nKlein said he \"would not be surprised if [Buffett] is selling right now\" and that Buffett \"knows when that 13F comes out showing he started to sell, that [Apple] shares will get killed as retail investors rush for the exit.\"\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK) most recent 13F disclosed that Buffett sold some of his Apple stock, albeit a marginal 1% of his massive position.\nNews of Berkshire Hathaway selling more shares could put pressure on the stock given that the company owns 5.9% of all outstanding Apple shares, representing 42.8% of its entire stock portfolio.\nWhile Buffett has said that his \"favorite holding period is forever,\" Berkshire's portfolio has experienced turnover lately.\nTrending: This startup coined \u201ceBay for gamers\u201d with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\nIn addition to trimming its Apple stock, Berkshire exited its positions in StoneCo Ltd.

(NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA).\nThe D.R Horton stake in particular was built up as recently as the second quarter of last year.\nKlein sees the stock as likely to lag the market until the company shares more about its AI plans, which he speculates might come as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) developer event.\nDan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, deems the situation a strong buying opportunity, giving Apple's stock a price target of $250 per share. He cites massive pent-up demand in the iPhone upgrade cycle and high expectations of \"AI finally coming to Cupertino (in California).\"\nFor long-term investors in Apple, it's paid to ignore short-term worries and stay the course.

Citi analyst Atif Malik rates the stock a buy, but he trimmed his near-term price target over concerns about sluggish iPhone demand in China.\nMalik's new price target is $220 a share, which still represents an upside over the next 12 months or so of 27% over the current share price of roughly $173.\nWhile Wall Street generally operates on a shorter time frame than the average investor, analysts' opinions can be valuable in understanding what is driving the stock's performance in the short term. In this case, the analyst cited weakening smartphone sales in China for the price target cut.\nApple is coming off a strong quarter, where iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the December-ending quarter. However, a recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that weekly smartphone unit sales in China through the first six weeks of 2024 were down 7% year over year.

While iPhone revenue in China fell last quarter, it also hit records in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific.\nChina is a wildcard for Apple, but the company's growing installed base of devices, which continues to hit record highs, is a better indicator of its global brand strength and where the business is headed over the long term.\nThe stock is still a good investment.

As Bloomberg News has previously reported, the Pro models will get crisper new OLED displays \u2014 short for organic light-emitting diode \u2014 while the iPad Air will get a 12.9-inch screen option for the first time.\nThe move marks an end to the longest stretch without new models in the history of the iPad, which was first introduced by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2010. It\u2019s been about 18 months since the last updates \u2014 a drought that\u2019s contributed to already-sluggish demand for tablets. Apple is betting that the new models, with faster chips and revamped accessories, can help spur a renaissance for the category.\nAfter a run-up during the pandemic, iPad sales have fallen in each of Apple\u2019s last two fiscal years, which run through September. They suffered an additional 25% year-over-year decline during the latest holiday period, when the devices have typically been popular gifts.\nA spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\nThe iPad Pro models \u2014 codenamed J717, J718, J720 and J721 \u2014 will run the new M3 chip and work with redesigned versions of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil. The update represents the first overhaul to that lineup since 2018.\nThe iPad Air, meanwhile, was last updated in 2022 with the M1 chip. It will get a new processor, and the 12.9-screen size means consumers can get a large iPad for less money than the more upscale Pro. The current iPad Air starts at $599, while the Pro line costs $200 more.\nApple had planned to release the new iPads by the end of March or early April, but the company has been working to finish software for the devices. The screens in the latest models also require complex new manufacturing techniques, which have contributed to the delay.\nAn early May product release would come about a month before Apple\u2019s next major event.

        "Text": "The first generation iPhone was a worldwide phenomenon when it was released on June 29, 2007. Avid fans around the world lined up for hours, or even days, to get their hands on the very first iPhones, ushering in an era of incredible profitability for the company. And while there\u2019s no arguing that those very first customers got plenty of use and enjoyment out of their iPhones, they might have felt even better in the long run if they had invested that money in Apple stock instead of the original iPhone product.\nFind Out: If You Had Invested $10K in GameStop and AMC in 2021, Here\u2019s How Much You\u2019d Have TodayRead More: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nOn that fateful day in June 2007, two versions of the original iPhone went on sale. The first was the 4GB version of the iPhone, while the other had twice the storage space, at 8GB. The costs of the phones were $499 and $599, respectively.\nOn a split-adjusted basis, the cost per share of Apple stock on June 29, 2007, was $3.69. So, for the price of the original iPhones, investors instead could have ended up with between 135 and 162 shares of Apple stock, depending on which version of the phone they bought.\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nPerhaps surprisingly \u2014 although not to collectors \u2014 some of the original iPhones have actually gone up in value since their initial sales date in 2007. This doesn\u2019t apply to all 1st-gen iPhones, of course, but some that are brand new and in pristine, unused condition are being offered for well over $1,000 on third-party seller sites like eBay. However, most used iPhones from that era, while still maintaining some value, do not command premiums to their original sales prices. Like most obsolete technology, original iPhones that were regularly used, as opposed to being preserved as an investment, are not worth much at all.\nOn the other hand, Apple stock has been nothing short of a home run for investors who bought shares on June 29, 2007.\nAs of closing on March 11, 2024, a $499 investment (at 135 shares) in Apple stock \u2014 the purchase price of the original 4GB iPhone \u2014 was worth $172.75 x 135 shares = $23,321.25\nA $599 investment in Apple stock (at 162 shares) instead of the original 8GB iPhone would pay off even more handsomely, with its value jumping to $27,98.50, as of March 11, 2024.\nThis means that investors who bought Apple stock instead of a single basic iPhone in 2007 could now afford 23 of the latest top-of-the-line iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro, which start at $999.\nOr, more practically, an investor could now buy a top-of-the-line iPhone and still have over $22,000 in cash left over.\nBy contrast, an \u201cinvestor\u201d in the first iPhone would simply have a single, out-of-date phone.\nNo matter how much satisfaction a consumer good offers, in the long run, you\u2019ll always be better off financially by investing rather than spending. The math behind the iPhone vs. Apple stock example above demonstrates this clearly. Of course, the utility and enjoyment that users get out of products like the iPhone do have value. But from a strictly financial perspective, it pays to remember that consumer goods like iPhones and cars depreciate over time, while investments like stocks and houses tend to appreciate in value.\nMartin Dasko contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Food Items You Should Always Buy at Walmart\nI Was Retired, but Wasted Big Money On These 3 Things and Had To Go Back To Work\n7 Things to Do With Your Savings in 2024 to Grow Your Wealth\n4 Reasons You Should Be Getting Your Paycheck Early, According to An Expert\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: What If You Had Invested In Apple Stock Instead of Buying the First iPhone?\n"

        "Text": "Apple is getting squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\nJust as the tech giant braces for a sweeping lawsuit from the Justice Department in the US, it was hit Monday with a $2 billion European Commission (EC) fine for allegedly breaking competition laws overseas.\nApple intends to fight the decision from the European Union\u2019s antitrust regulator. It also has been trying to convince Justice Department officials not to file their suit, according to media reports.\nThe company and its lawyers even met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in late February to make a last-ditch argument, according to those reports.\nApple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). But that is now changing.\nApple's stock closed down over 2.5% following the decision by the European Commission and is down more than 5% this year.\nThe EC\u2019s action was very specific: It fined the company for wielding its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\nThose practices first came under investigation in the European Union in 2019 after Swedish music streaming giant Spotify (SPOT) filed a formal complaint about the store's rules.\nThe EC concluded that Apple drove up music streaming costs for iOS users for nearly a decade by prohibiting app developers from fully informing them about alternative ways to access and pay for streaming services outside of Apple\u2019s proprietary app store.\nThrough provisions in Apple\u2019s contracts, the EC said Apple illegally steered app purchases predominantly through the App Store, where Apple collects a 30% fee.\n\"Apple's conduct, which lasted for almost ten years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store,\" the commission said in a summary of its findings.\nIn response, Apple criticized the EC, saying that its decision failed to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignored that the music streaming market is thriving, competitive, and fast-growing.\n\"The primary advocate for this decision \u2014 and the biggest beneficiary \u2014 is Spotify,\" Apple said in a blog post. It went on to point out that Spotify had grown to become the largest music streaming app in the world while paying Apple nothing for its services.\n\"Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe\u2019s music streaming market \u2014 more than double their closest competitor\u2019s,\" Apple said, attributing a major part of that success to the App Store.\nApple has previously characterized Spotify's complaint with the EC as an attempt to get \"limitless access\" to Apple's tools, free of charge.\nThe US antitrust investigation appears to be even more sweeping, according to media reports. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company\u2019s suite of products \u2014 including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags \u2014 blocks competition.\nAny DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple\u2019s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams.\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Apple Has Spent $175 Billion on R&D Since the Start of 2013 -- but It's the $651 Billion Spent on Something Else That's the Real Jaw-Dropper",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Although it's been surpassed by Microsoft as the largest publicly traded company by market cap, few tech giants have delivered for investors quite like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\nDespite its ebbs and flows, shares of Apple have scurried higher by 790% over the trailing-10-year period and have skyrocketed by almost 132,000% since its initial public offering in December 1980. Investors who simply purchased shares of Apple and did nothing else have historically done pretty well.\nWhile there's a laundry list of catalysts that have lifted Apple's valuation over time, the company's success ultimately boils down to two factors: innovation and a surprising \"investment\" that's been highly beneficial to its shareholders.\nTo become one of the largest publicly traded companies, a business will generally have to grow at a sustained high rate and remain on the cutting edge of the innovation curve within its respective sector or industry. Peering back through more than 11 years of annual and quarterly filings, it's clear that Apple and its management team, led by CEO Tim Cook, aren't afraid to invest for the future.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses have grown every year since the start of 2013 and total just over $175 billion through the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024 (Dec. 30, 2023):\n2013: $4.475 billion in R&D expenses\n2014: $6.041 billion\n2015: $8.067 billion\n2016: $10.045 billion\n2017: $11.581 billion\n2018: $14.236 billion\n2019: $16.217 billion\n2020: $18.752 billion\n2021: $21.914 billion\n2022: $26.251 billion\n2023: $29.915 billion\nQ1 2024: $7.696 billion\nSome of these growing R&D expenses are undoubtedly directed at keeping the company in the lead in the smartphone arena. Since Apple integrated 5G wireless technology into its flagship iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's seen its domestic market share in smartphones surge above 50%. Consumers tend to be exceptionally loyal to Apple's physical products, which include iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, among other accessories.\nHowever, Apple's R&D spending goes beyond the physical products that brought the company fame. For years, Tim Cook has been overseeing the evolution of Apple's operations. Although it's still producing and improving its popular physical products, Apple is aiming to be a platforms company that's ultimately driven by subscriptions.\nThe advantage of the company's services focus is threefold:\nSubscriptions typically generate higher margins than physical products.\nIt'll further enhance the loyalty of Apple's customer base by keeping consumers within its ecosystem of physical products and services.\nThe steady revenue generated by Apple's Services segment will smooth out the sales fluctuations traditionally observed during iPhone upgrade cycles.\nWhat's even more eye-popping than the $175.19 billion Apple has spent on R&D since the beginning of 2013 is its \"investment\" that's nearly quadrupled R&D in size over the same period.\nWith Apple generating boatloads of operating cash flow, it has the ability to take chances that most companies can't match. It can also reward shareholders in a way that no other business can.\nOn a nominal-dollar basis, Apple's dividend is one of the largest in the world. Last year, the company doled out just a hair over $15 billion to its shareholders as a dividend. But its share repurchase program is many multiples larger.\nSince initiating a share buyback program in 2013, Apple has overseen the repurchase of $650.88 billion worth of its common stock, which is tops among publicly traded companies:\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks\n2014: $45 billion\n2015: $35.253 billion\n2016: $29.722 billion\n2017: $32.9 billion\n2018: $72.738 billion\n2019: $66.897 billion\n2020: $72.358 billion\n2021: $85.971 billion\n2022: $89.402 billion\n2023: $77.55 billion\nQ1 2024: $20.139 billion\nThe beauty of share buybacks is twofold. To start with, a declining share count incrementally increases the ownership stakes of existing investors.\nBut the second and arguably more important catalyst is that stock repurchases can increase a company's earnings per share (EPS). Businesses with steady or growing net income will see their EPS grow over time as their outstanding share count declines. This can make a company's stock appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\nAs an example, Apple's net income declined from $99.8 billion in fiscal 2022 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September) to roughly $97 billion in fiscal 2023. But thanks to Apple spending $77.55 billion on buybacks last year, which retired more than 513 million shares, the company's adjusted EPS actually increased by $0.02 to $6.13 per share in 2023, despite the $2.8 billion drop in net income.\nSince the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased nearly 11 billion shares of common stock, or roughly 41% of its outstanding shares.\nWhile buybacks have played a key role in lifting Apple's share price over the past 11 years and change, Wall Street and investors are likely eager to see one of the world's largest tech companies reignite its growth engine after it stalled out in 2023. But as long as Apple continues to aggressively put its money to work via buybacks, it's reasonable to expect modest EPS expansion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Mike Scarcella ",
        "Text": "By Mike Scarcella\n(Reuters) - The U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Apple draws on the watershed 1998 case that broke Microsoft's stranglehold on desktop software, but that may prove to be an imperfect blueprint for addressing smartphone competition.\nThe market for the iPhone today looks very different from the near-monopoly enjoyed by Microsoft's Windows operating system two decades ago, and the government as a result may face a tougher time in taking on Apple, legal experts said.\nThe Department of Justice, along with 15 state governments, accused Apple of unlawfully monopolizing the smartphone market through restrictions on app developers that curb choice and innovation, which it said forces consumers to pay higher prices.\nApple said the government is wrong on the facts and law.\nThe government has to prove that Apple\u2019s business practices were \u201cexclusionary\u201d and harmed consumers by degrading the quality of rival products, according to several legal experts.\nThe government accused Apple of suppressing technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones in five areas: so-called \"super apps,\" cloud streamed gaming apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets.\nOne example the government gave is familiar to anyone who texts from an iPhone to a user of an Android phone \u2014 the dreaded \"green bubble\" that results in hindrances such as grainy photos sent by text that don't apply when texting between two phones using Apple's iOS operating system.\nAntitrust enforcers said Apple was rapidly expanding its influence and power in industries including content creation and financial services.\nBy comparison, Microsoft was accused of abusing its market dominance to impede users from freely installing software on computers using the company\u2019s operating system.\nThat might sound similar to Apple's control over the app store, but legal experts said there are important differences.\nApple can contract with whom it wants and design products as it sees fit, legal experts said.\nIt becomes a problem when a company with monopoly power takes steps to lessen short-term profit in order to keep rivals out in the longer term, said Douglas Ross, an antitrust scholar at University of Washington\u2019s law school.\n\u201cThe fundamental assumption DOJ seems to have is that Apple must cooperate with its rivals to allow rivals to compete with Apple,\" Ross said. \"That has antitrust law backwards.\"\nMARKET SHARE\nMicrosoft was forced to open its operating system because it controlled 95% of desktop operating systems in the 1990s. By comparison, Apple had 55% of the North American market for smartphones at the end of September based on shipments, with the rest largely made up of phones using Google's Android operating system, according to Canalys, a market analysis firm.\nThe Justice Department seeks to define the market as that of smartphones in the United States. Apple representatives said they will try to persuade the court to define the market as the global smartphone market.\nApple and rival Samsung Electronics each had about a 20% market share globally in 2023, though Apple beat Samsung slightly on shipments, Canalys data showed.\nMicrosoft \"clearly was a monopolist and there were no effective competitors in the PC operating system space,\" Ross said. On the other hand, Android \u201cis very popular, especially in the rest of the world, and is a very effective competitor with iOS.\u201d\nRoss predicted it would be harder for the Justice Department to prevail against Apple than it was in the Microsoft case.\nSome of these allegations have been touched upon before in court.\nIn 2021, in an antitrust case brought by \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games, a federal judge found after a trial that Epic failed to prove that Apple users were \"locked-in\" to their iPhones and would not switch to Android devices.\nOf course, government attorneys know these differences and still brought the case.\nLegal experts said that reflects the viewpoint within the DOJ and the Biden Administration's Federal Trade Commission about challenging cases.\n\u201cThey are happy to take on the risk of a really big case,\u201d said plaintiffs' lawyer Patrick McGahan, whose firm is involved in litigation against Apple.\nLitigator Melissa Maxman in Washington said the Microsoft case changed the tech landscape and lauded the government's lawsuit as a step toward greater competition in the smartphone market.\n\"If you open up the market for other competitors to get in you will see prices go down and quality go up,\" Maxman said. \"That's exactly what was said in Microsoft \u2014 and guess what, it was true.\"\n(This story has been refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 11)\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by Tom Hals and Jamie Freed)\n"

        "Title": "Will Apple Acquire Rivian? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks it Should",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are among the bedrock technologies of the sustainability movement. Unsurprisingly, most legacy car manufacturers, including Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen, have experimented with battery-powered vehicles.\nBut beyond traditional automakers, some big tech companies have shown an interest in entering the EV market. For the last several years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has reportedly been working on an EV of its own. In a lot of ways, this makes sense. Apple has a long history of innovation, specifically when it comes to consumer electronics. However, just this week, news broke that Apple is abandoning its in-house EV effort, dubbed Project Titan.\nDoes this mean that Apple is giving up on its EV ambitions for good?\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management is one of Wall Street's most respected technology analysts. And while Project Titan appears to have been consigned to the dustbin of tech sector history, Munster just floated an interesting idea.\nDuring a discussion on CNBC Tuesday, Munster put forth the notion that Apple should acquire Rivian. This is interesting for several reasons.\nFirst, Rivian has demonstrated some success in the highly competitive EV landscape. However, the company seems to be stuck in a \"one step forward, two steps back\" paradigm. In other words, every time it seems to be turning over a new leaf, fresh problems arise.\nOn one side of the equation, you have Apple, a company whose flagship consumer electronics business is struggling. The company's revenue has been in consistent decline as consumers wait longer between upgrades of products such as iPhones, iPads, laptops, and wearable devices.\nWhile Apple's Services business is accelerating nicely, that growth has not been enough to offset the lagging hardware sales. As such, Apple is in need of additional growth drivers.\nOn the other side of the equation sits Rivian. In 2023, it produced 57,232 vehicles -- an increase of 135% year over year. While that's encouraging, it's not all smooth sailing from here.\nDuring the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, management shocked investors when it guided for essentially flat production in 2024.\nApple and Rivian both share a similar problem: In an economic environment defined by interest rates higher than consumers have dealt with in years and the ripple effects of recent high inflation, demand for luxury consumer goods is simply not that strong.\nWith both companies desperate to accelerate growth and get investors excited, are Apple and Rivian a match made in heaven?\nOn the surface, I completely understand Munster's proposal.\nFor Rivian, a deal with Apple could be transformative. As part of Apple, it would immediately gain access to a larger team of engineers and technologists, and would have the luxury of Apple's bankroll. Apple, meanwhile, would gain access to the EV market and add yet another product to its sticky ecosystem.\nApple currently has more than $73 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Rivian's market capitalization is around $11 billion.Given those parameters, it's clear that Apple could acquire Rivian in an all-cash deal at a pretty generous premium, and still have plenty of change left over.\nBut a closer look at Apple's history with regard to making acquisitions puts the possibility of such a hypothetical deal becoming reality in a different light.\nApple's largest purchase ever was its $3 billion deal for headphone company Beats Electronics in 2014. Across its 10 largest acquisitions, Apple has spent roughly $7.4 billion.\nThose data points make one thing clear: Apple rarely pursues big-ticket acquisitions. So while the idea of it acquiring Rivian is interesting, and while such a deal could even make strategic sense for both companies, I see it as highly unlikely. Large-scale acquisitions have not been part of Apple's DNA, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The overall smartphone market in China shrank 7%, the report said.\nApple \"faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi,\" Counterpoint's senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said.\nApple began subsidizing certain iPhone models by as much as 1,300 yuan ($180.68) last week through flagship stores on Tmall, Alibaba's major marketplace platform.\nIt had already offered iPhone discounts of up to 500 yuan on its official sites last month.\nHuawei has seen a resurgence in its premium smartphone sales since it released its Mate 60 series in August after struggling for years with U.S. curbs on the exports of key components to the company.\nHonor, the smartphone brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, was the only other top-five brand to see unit sales increase during the first six weeks of the year, up 2%. Chinese brands Vivo, Xiaomi and Oppo dropped 15%, 7% and 29%, respectively.\n(Reporting by Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh; Additional reporting by Aditya Soni and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Jacqueline Wong, Kirsten Donovan, Arun Koyyur and Krishna Chandra Eluri)\n"

But Apple's eye-popping growth in services \u2014 its impressive ability to extract more revenue from the periphery of its ecosystem \u2014 drives much of the hostility against it.\nSales of the iPhone still account for more than half of Apple's revenue. But the services that tie into the phone are amassing an increasingly important role in the company's business. For some of Apple's more bullish analysts, the promise of the services segment is the narrative fuel behind Cupertino's growth story and a pillar of its $2.6 trillion valuation.\nThat also explains the company's strategic predicament. As Apple leans more heavily into generating value by keeping people within its system \u2014 from things like App Store commissions and subscriptions \u2014 the more scrutiny it draws to its business practices.\nThe antitrust suit is the latest challenge weighing on the company's share price, which has flagged in recent months, in part due to slowing iPhone sales in China.\nTech's growth narrative has finally shifted away from phones/apps to AI, a theme aptly illustrated by Bank of America Global Research analysts who wrote Wednesday that their recent trip to Asia was the first trip in two decades \"where smartphones were barely a part of the conversation.\"\nServices might be a long-term financial solution to the waning importance of the iPhone. It's also an invitation for regulators to investigate monopoly power and test the strength of the \"Walled Garden,\" as Apple's closed ecosystem is often called.\nTo Apple, the seamlessness of the iPhone experience reflects the security of its products and the vibrance of its offerings, a message it is counting on Steve Jobs disciple Phil Schiller to affirm. Riffraff does not make it past the App Store's front desk, and Apple will not lend out jackets to any shady developers who show up flaunting the club's rules. And like any club, its success comes from the members sticking around.\nBut to the users and developers aggrieved by the company's practices (high club dues!) the walls are a means of exclusion. And even worse, that walled garden isn't just keeping people out \u2014 it's keeping people in.\nMuch of the conflict hinges on interpreting convenience or confinement, of attempting to prove loyalty or lock-in. Perhaps a drawn-out courtroom battle will spell out the spoils of Big Tech's conquest: that years later, people can't tell the difference.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "'Apple will prevail': US faces uphill slog in new antitrust battle",
        "Author": " Alexis Keenan    \u00b7 Senior Legal Reporter",
        "Text": "Attorney General Merrick Garland made a bold statement last week when he announced a new antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL): \"The United States normally wins the cases that it brings.\"\nBut not all legal experts agree that federal prosecutors hold the upper hand in a legal battle that aims to dismantle the architecture of Apple\u2019s marquee product, the iPhone.\n\"My guess is [Apple] will win,\" University of Chicago law professor Randy Picker told Yahoo Finance Live.\nEven if Apple does not prevail in the New Jersey federal court where the case was filed, Picker expects the tech giant to succeed on appeals, possibly to the Supreme Court.\n\"Yes, I think that Apple will prevail in the end.\"\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several confrontations between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\nThe Justice Department is also suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) \u2014 alleging they also violate antitrust laws.\nThe case against Apple is the widest-ranging of these tech antitrust suits. The Justice Department alleges that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.\nThe tech giant last week called the suit a threat to the very principles that set the company apart from its rivals and characterized the government\u2019s legal theory as a dubious one with legal claims that were wrong on the facts and the law.\nIn broad terms, the government alleges Apple must open up the iPhone operating system so that it becomes easier for non-Apple businesses to add and run their own products \u2014 including digital wallets, smartwatches, messaging apps, super apps, and cloud streaming apps \u2014 on the iPhone.\nApple said forcing it to open up the iPhone\u2019s ecosystem would ultimately harm consumers by hampering its ability to design \"the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect.\"\nCentral to that design, the company said, are privacy, security, and safety features that give users high levels of personal and financial data protection.\nHarvard Kennedy School adjunct cybersecurity policy lecturer Bruce Schneier said that if Apple does a good job of making the security argument, \"I think they win.\"\nBut there is a potential weakness to that argument. The iPhone's security protection, he said, is attributable to the company\u2019s business model and not to the phone's design.\n\"Apple does have more security because they don't spy on people for a living,\" Schneier said. \"They make the money on devices and electronics.\"\nWhat's more, the iPhone and a rival smartphone like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel offer similar security features, according to Schneier.\n\"Don\u2019t be confused in thinking that security is an end in itself. It furthers the goal of profits.\"\nSome argue the government has a strong case.\n\"I think it\u2019s very well pleaded,\" said New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox, who pointed out that the DOJ claims to have evidence of Apple\u2019s deliberate steps to block competition and cut out options for consumers.\nThere is no doubt, however, that the government has some challenges to overcome.\nOne is that judges are typically restrained from ordering companies to change the way they run their business, according to Boston College of Law antitrust professor David Olson.\nTo overcome those limits, Olson said, the government is alleging that the iPhone falls into a category of products so essential to life that they get special treatment under antitrust law.\nUnless the government proves the iPhone is an \"essential facility,\" Olson explained, Apple has autonomy to make their products how they want.\nAnother challenge for the US government is that it must adequately identify Apple as a monopolist in a particular market.\nThe market of choice in this case is the smartphone market; Apple holds roughly 70% of the US smartphone market and 20% of the global market.\nThen it must address a critical question: \"What have you done with your monopoly that\u2019s problematic?\u201d Picker said.\nThe government\u2019s answer is that Apple\u2019s design of the iPhone is illegal because it works most optimally with its own apps and products \u2014 like iWatch, iMessage, Wallet, and the App Store. That, in turn, makes it difficult for customers to switch to a non-Apple device.\nOne potential advantage for Apple is that it has successfully argued in other court cases that it maintains tight control over its ecosystem to protect consumers rather than harm them.\nIn fact, the arguments Apple surfaced last week echoed those it made in a private antitrust case brought in 2020 by the developer of the mega-popular gaming app \u201cFortnite,\u201d Epic Games.\nIt was a case that Apple mostly won.\nA federal district court judge in California and a three-judge appellate court panel in San Francisco ruled that Epic failed to show Apple held a monopoly in either of the disputed markets at issue: the mobile-game transactions market or the markets for iOS app distribution and in-app payment solutions.\nThe Justice Department has made some compelling claims in its new suit against Apple, Olson said, but he doubts that under scrutiny they will hold up as antitrust law violations.\n\"It gives us a litany of practices that DOJ argues make consumers and developers worse off,\" Olson said, but the harder question is whether those practices are merely a list of what Apple could do to make things better for developers or customers.\n\"It's usually a pretty hard case to say that someone has to, because of antitrust law, change the way they are running their company.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the names of Bruce Schneier and David Olson.

        "Text": "Apple and Microsoft are the two largest companies in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. While Apple had been the undisputed king for years, Microsoft usurped it in early February 2024, claiming the crown as the stock with the largest market cap in the S&P 500. As of March 5, 2024, Microsoft comprised 7.14% of the entire S&P 500 all by itself, while Apple was close behind at 6.08%. The next nearest stock, third-place Nvidia, makes up just 4.7% of the index.\nFind Out: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t SellRead More: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nWhile Microsoft\u2019s ascendance has had lots to do with its recent outperformance vs. Apple, how do the two tech giants stack up against each other over a longer time period, such as 10 years? Here\u2019s a look at the numbers behind the names.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nOn March 5, 2014, Apple stock closed at a price of $16.75, adjusted for all splits. Ten years later, on March 5, 2024, Apple closed at $170.12. Patient investors who held the stock through all of its ups and downs were rewarded with what Wall Street refers to as a \u201c10-bagger,\u201d a stock that provided a return of 10x the original investment. On a percentage basis, those who held Apple stock over the past 10 years earned a 916% return.\nMicrosoft began the last 10 years with a stock price of $32.27, once again adjusted for all splits. With its closing price of $402.65 on March 5, 2024, it recorded an incredible gain of 1,148%. This is even more than Apple\u2019s outsized gain of 916% and marks a more than 12x return for Microsoft investors who held the stock for the full 10 years. As impressive as Apple\u2019s performance has been over the past decade, Microsoft\u2019s surge helps explain why the company has at least temporarily taken away Apple\u2019s throne atop the S&P 500 market cap leaders.\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nApple has been a public company since Dec. 12, 1980. Its IPO price that day was $22, but after adjusting for splits over the years, the effective IPO price was just 10 cents. This gives Apple an average annual return since inception of 18.87%, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 10.38% annual return over the same time period. That\u2019s a pretty impressive outperformance, particularly for a company that has been public for over 43 years.\nIt may be hard to believe, but Microsoft\u2019s outperformance has been even more dramatic. The company went public on March 13, 1986, at $21 per share. On a split-adjusted basis, that IPO price was effectively $0.0729 per share. Running the numbers from there shows that Microsoft has posted an average annual return of 26.18% since its inception. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 \u201conly\u201d returned 10.38% per year since Microsoft\u2019s IPO date. In other words, over the last 38 years, Microsoft has, on average, trounced the S&P 500 every year by an average factor of 2 1/2 times.\nBased on recent momentum, Microsoft is the best play right now. The stock is up 8.57% YTD as of March 5, and 58.43% over the past year. Analysts have an average 12-month price target of $468.70 on the stock, with a consensus \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating. If MSFT reaches that target, that would translate to an additional 16% gain over the next year.\nApple has been a Wall Street darling for years on end now, so it\u2019s no surprise that even with its recent pullback analysts have a consensus \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating on that stock as well. The average 12-month price target of $205.77 suggests a 21% gain is possible in the coming year.\nWhich stock is best for you will depend on a combination of your investment objectives, risk tolerance and your opinion on how the stocks and companies are performing. For example, if you\u2019re more of a consumer products investor, you might give the nod to Apple. If you\u2019re more inclined to buy a more tech-oriented stock that\u2019s on the cutting edge of AI, Microsoft might appeal to you more. The type of investor you are can also play a role. For example, if you favor stocks that have momentum, Microsoft might be your choice. But if you\u2019re looking for a high-quality name that has sold off recently and has a higher 12-month potential gain according to analysts, Apple might be the call.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nI'm a Costco Superfan: These Are the 5 Highest-Quality Kirkland Food Items\n10 Best (and Worst) Places To Retire If You Have No Savings\nThe 6 Smartest Things to Do With Your Tax Refund\n7 Ways Fraudsters Are Trying to Scam People in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Which Was the Better Investment 10 Years Ago: Apple or Microsoft?\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple also lost its title as the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).\nAt the center of the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit is the iPhone, Apple\u2019s most recognizable product.\nThe company harms consumers by making it more difficult for iPhone users to switch to a competing product and to access competing services, according to the government. The complaint also says Apple harms app developers by imposing restrictions on app creation and distribution.\nThat includes everything from text messaging to digital wallets to apps that reduce user dependence on the iPhone.\nGarland, for example, characterized Apple\u2019s iMessage as anti-competitive, saying that when it is used to text with a Google Android device, the iPhone user\u2019s response is in green rather than blue.\nThat, he said, \"limits functionality.\" The videos sent via text, Garland added, can also be pixelated and grainy.\nHe then quoted Apple\u2019s CEO responding to a complaint from a user who said he couldn\u2019t send his mom certain videos: \"'Buy your mom an iPhone.'\"\nApple, the suit alleges, also makes it more difficult for smartphone users to access competing digital wallets by blocking developers from using tap-to-pay functionality in their apps. And it prevents the Apple Watch from working with Android smartphones while making it more difficult for someone with an iPhone to use a rival\u2019s smartwatch.\n\"Apple repeatedly responded to competitive threats,\" said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, \"by making it harder to leave, then making it more attractive to stay. The antitrust laws have something to say about that.\"\nApple, according to the suit, also suppresses cloud streaming gaming apps and denies consumers access to so-called super apps, which allow users access to a broad range of functionalities from a single interface.\nThe wide-ranging suit is \"about the core unfair practices of Apple,\" Case Western Reserve University antitrust expert and law professor Anat Alon-Beck said.\n\"Apple systematically excludes rivals from the Apple ecosystem. By doing that, Apple is hurting so many startup businesses, stakeholders, customers, and, in my opinion, its shareholders.\"\nAs a result, she predicts that Apple's stock will \"see more downward movement.\"\nThis is just the latest antitrust battle Apple has had to contend with in the US.\nThe last was in 2020, when \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games sued the company and accused it of violating antitrust law by prohibiting third-party app developers from offering their own payment methods within their apps \u2014as opposed to using Apple's payment service.\nJustice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in that high-stakes dispute. It focused attention on Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 the only place consumers can download apps for iPhones and iPads, which generally charges app developers a 30% commission on paid app purchases made through the platform.\nApple scored a victory in that case when the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.\nHowever, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for users to pay for purchases.\nBoth companies tried to take their fight to the Supreme Court, though the high court declined to take up either appeal.\nFollowing that decision, Apple said it will allow developers to offer third-party payment options through their apps. However, the company said developers would still have to pay fees of either 12% or 27%, a move Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called \"anticompetitive.\"\nApple is in the midst of reconfiguring its App Store payment system in the European Union. Under the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company must allow EU customers the option to download third-party app stores and get access to third-party payment options.\nApple said it would address the measure and allow third-party downloads and payments, but will still charge developers a fee of 50 euro cents for each download if they cross the 1 million download threshold in a year.\nBoth Epic and Spotify objected to the measure, with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek calling the new rule \"hostile.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the names of Anat Alon-Beck and Jonathan Kanter.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has had a challenging start to 2024, with its shares down 9% year to date. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, which led to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\nHowever, outperforming estimates haven't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of its business. In the first quarter of 2024, Apple's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.\nThen, on March 4, Apple's stock slipped 3% in early trading after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service.\nDespite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. A recent stock dip could be the perfect time to make a long-term investment in its business and profit from its potential over the next decade.\nSo here are two reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.\nApple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.\nThe popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.\nWhile declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.\nMoreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030. Apple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance.\nAs a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.\nThe tech market is booming, with the Nasdaq-100 technology sector up 11% year to date. Wall Street has grown bullish about the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and improvements in e-commerce, sending countless tech stocks soaring. While this has been beneficial for current investors, it has raised the price of entry for new ones.\nHowever, recent headwinds have kept Apple's stock at an attractive price point. This chart below shows that Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon. The figures indicate that Apple's shares are trading at a bargain by comparison, offering considerably more value.\nThese are useful metrics for determining a stock's value as they take into account a company's financial health. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing an organization's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, price-to-free cash flow divides market cap by free cash flow.\nApple has faced repeated hits to its business over the past year. However, it's on a promising growth path. The company is playing the long game with its venture into VR/AR and expansion in other smartphone markets. Additionally, it has funds to invest heavily in its development.\nA recent stock tumble has boosted the value of its shares and made it low risk, with Apple worth buying like there's no tomorrow.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The displays, which featured brighter and more vibrant visuals, would have been added to a future version of the Apple Watch \u2014 before potentially going into other products.\n@markgurman has more https://t.co/klDOsb6iHz pic.twitter.com/NxFs9WFTzd\n\u2014 Bloomberg (@business) March 22, 2024\nBut the cost and complexity of the effort ultimately proved too great. So Apple is now reorganizing the teams that handle display engineering and eliminating several dozen roles in the US and Asia, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\nThe move to shutter the project came around the same time as the company\u2019s decision to cancel work on a self-driving car. In both cases, Apple is giving at least some affected employees the opportunity to find other roles within the company. If they can\u2019t get new jobs \u2014 a likely scenario for some of them \u2014 the workers will be laid off and provided severance. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.\nThe display project was part of a broader push by Apple to design more of its technology in-house. Though the company already customizes the displays in its products, they are heavily based on designs from partners like LG Display Co. and Samsung SDI Co. By bringing more of that process inside Apple, the company hoped to gain an edge over competitors.\nIt also saw promise in microLED, which is made from millions of microscopic light-emitting diodes, and wanted to take a key role in developing it. The technology uses less power, reproduces colors more accurately and allows for thinner devices.\nThe effort kicked off about seven years ago within Apple\u2019s hardware engineering organization. It was later shifted to Wei Chen, who runs Apple\u2019s display group. The project \u2014 codenamed T159 \u2014 was relocated to Apple\u2019s hardware technologies division a few years ago.\nApple even built its own screen manufacturing facility in Santa Clara, California, near its Cupertino headquarters, where hundreds of employees could test the production of microLED screens. Many of the job cuts involve people at that site \u2014 along with Apple display engineering centers in Asia near the company\u2019s supply-chain hubs.\nRead More: Apple Is Developing Gadget Displays in Secret Facility\nA visit to the Santa Clara facility this week showed that the building was still operational, with cars in the parking lot and a small number of employees entering and exiting the building.\nWhen Apple hatched the microLED plan years ago, it saw the technology as a successor to the current standard: organic LED screens, or OLEDs. It expected to eventually push microLEDs into all of its products, from Apple Watches to iPhones to Macs.\nIn 2018, the company believed it was capable of bringing the screens to the Apple Watch as early as 2020. That timeline ended up getting delayed until 2024, and then 2025 and beyond. The situation was similar to Apple\u2019s work on the electric car, whose release was postponed several times.\nFor all their benefits, microLED screens were difficult to produce in sufficient quantities. Manufacturing them required cutting-edge technology and a complicated process called LED transfers \u2014 the placing of pixels in the display. Though Apple owned the design and manufacturing process for the microLED screens, it enlisted a number of partners to handle mass production and tasks like LED transfers.\nNews of a shift in the project first emerged in recent weeks, when suppliers announced that they were losing microLED-related contracts. That included AMS-Osram AG, which said the cancellation would force it to cut jobs, potentially sell a manufacturing plant and record a writedown that could approach $1 billion.\nFor now, Apple believes that OLED is the best current solution for its smartwatch. But it\u2019s still eyeing microLED for other projects down the road, the people said. The company is identifying potential new suppliers and processes that could make the technology a reality in its devices, though that won\u2019t likely happen anytime soon.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley\nIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving\nHong Kong\u2019s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China\nTesla\u2019s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue\nHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "By Martin Coulter\n(Reuters) -Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.\nThe negotiations are about licensing Gemini for some new features coming to the iPhone software this year, the report said, adding that the terms or branding of an AI agreement or how it would be implemented have not been decided.\nAlphabet shares jumped more than 6% in early U.S. trading, while Apple was up 2.5%.\nIt is unlikely that any deal would be announced until June, when Apple plans to hold its annual conference of developers, and the iPhone maker also recently held talks with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI about using its model, according to the report.\nApple, Alphabet-owned Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nA potential deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\nIt could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year.\nThe firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance.\nBut the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google on grounds that it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its monopoly in search.\n\"This strategic partnership is a missing piece in the Apple AI strategy and combines forces with Google for Gemini to power some of the AI features Apple is bringing to market,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush.\n\"This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major licence fee attached to this,\" he said, referring to Apple's California headquarters.\nGoogle in January partnered with Apple's rival Samsung to deploy its genAI technology in the South Korean firm's Galaxy S24 series of smartphones, as part of its efforts to boost the use of Gemini after some missteps during its roll-out.\nApple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the company was investing \"significantly\" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year.\nThe Bloomberg report said Apple was planning to use its own homegrown AI models for some new capabilities in its upcoming iOS 18, but was seeking a partner to power genAI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts.\n(Reporting by Jahnavi Nidumolu and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Janane Venkatraman, Varun H K and Susan Fenton)\n"

        "Title": "Apple-Google Gemini Partnership Could Make an Unstoppable AI Force",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), shot higher yesterday, finishing the day up 4.6%, following a Bloomberg report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be looking to Google Gemini as the AI integrated into the iPhone. Indeed, a potential Apple-Google Gemini partnership in artificial intelligence (AI) could mirror their deal with search, which was the subject of considerable regulatory scrutiny in recent years.\nAnd while a Google-Apple AI partnership is sure to draw the ire of antitrust regulators, I see the move as a potentially massive win for both companies as they seek to gain (further) in the AI race.\nWith Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading the charge on generative AI with its OpenAI stake, Apple must find a way to make up for lost time on the AI front. Teaming up with Google is a way to catch up with industry leaders like Microsoft. Also, it may be a straightforward way to pull ahead as Apple gains access to one of the most potent large language models (LLMs), Google Gemini. Given this, I remain bullish on both AAPL and GOOGL.\nWhile I\u2019m sure Apple could incorporate its own LLM into its devices, I think Google is the better option at this early phase in the AI boom. Why? As good as LLMs have become in recent quarters, they\u2019re still not immune from hallucinating (making stuff up, seemingly out of the blue).\nOnly time will tell when we have a robust, hallucination-free LLM ready for the market. Regardless, given Apple\u2019s history of releasing polished products that are truly ready for takeoff, I just don\u2019t see Apple putting itself out there with a work-in-progress type of LLM product.\nAs capable and impressive as they are, even the latest versions of Google Gemini and ChatGPT-4 Turbo are technically works in progress, at least in my opinion.\nNeither LLM is perfect, especially at this point in the AI lifecycle, when hallucinations still happen regularly. My guess is it could take a while before LLMs are polished enough that mistakes become incredibly rare (or maybe virtually impossible).\nPerhaps we may be a few quarters or even a few years away from the error-free AI that many of us envision as a sort of holy grail in AI. Given how fast generative AI technologies are advancing (think exponential, not linear, rates), though, maybe hallucination-free LLMs are a heck of a lot closer than many of us may think.\nFor now, I think the masses have come to accept that the occasional hiccup is bound to happen when using even the best LLM that exists today. Users of such LLMs can simply check the sources themselves to ensure they\u2019re not on the receiving end of a hallucination. Indeed, fact-checking can be a bit of a hassle when using LLMs like Gemini or GPT-4, but it\u2019s a relatively small compromise. Further, it\u2019s between that and using an old-fashioned search engine.\nI don\u2019t think Apple has anything to really gain by rushing an LLM product to market right now, especially given that today\u2019s LLMs are prone to errors, negative headlines, lawsuits, public outrage, and all sorts of negativity.\nWhen the perfect time comes (perhaps when LLMs have a bit more polish), though, I think Apple could have the option to replace Google Gemini with its own LLM, just like when it gave Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the boot from Mac devices when it was ready to launch on the back of its very own Apple Silicon.\nIn these early stages of the AI boom, Apple stands to benefit from all the positives of AI by using Gemini without having to deal with the downsides. If something goes awry, it\u2019s the Gemini LLM, not Apple, that\u2019s to blame. In the meantime, look for Alphabet to gain traction as Gemini introduces itself to Apple\u2019s golden install base, which is billions of users strong.\nIndeed, Gemini in iPhone could ultimately help Google and Apple surpass Microsoft in the LLM race. It will be interesting to see how a potential Google-Apple partnership evolves. Nevertheless, if any deal is inked, I expect that GOOGL stock could face a considerable valuation multiple expansion, perhaps one closer to that of its top AI peer, MSFT stock, even if Alphabet is forced to pay Apple a hefty sum.\nEven after surging 4.6% in a day, GOOGL stock still seems to have room to run at just 25.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) if it\u2019s to catch up to MSFT stock\u2019s 37.7 times trailing P/E multiple.\nAlphabet stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 28 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average Alphabet stock price target\u00a0of $165.09 implies 12.3% upside potential.\nApple stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with 16 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average Apple stock price target\u00a0of $204.86 implies 16.3% upside potential.\nIt seems like a Google-Apple Gemini AI deal would be a win for both firms in a bid to pull ahead in the generative AI race. It\u2019s important to note, however, that all we have is a report from Bloomberg about potential talks between the two companies.\nThe chatter about the chatter means that nothing is set in stone yet, even though recent market action suggests a dotted line has already been signed. In any case, look for Apple to go on the hunt for an AI partner as it seeks a \u201cbackstop\u201d in this still-early (and less-than-polished) stage of generative AI.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Will Daniel ",
        "Text": "In China, consumers are opting to buy domestic products amid increasing tensions with the West, at least when it comes to their smartphones.\nApple\u2019s iPhone sales in the world's second largest economy, which are critical to its global revenues, nosedived 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report from Counterpoint Research. But over that same period, China\u2019s tech giant Huawei saw its sales surge 64%. Apple has struggled against \u201cstiff competition\u201d for high-end products from the \u201cresurgent\u201d Chinese competitor, Counterpoint\u2019s senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said of the data in a statement.\nSince last summer, Huawei has benefitted from the release of its Mate 60 phone series after struggling to source parts for many months due to Western sanctions. The new phone features 47% Chinese-made parts, 18 percentage points higher than the previous model, and is even powered by a Chinese-manufactured chip. The Mate 60 amounts to a major upgrade for many Huawei users, but Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 isn\u2019t quite as enticing among its user base, according to Counterpoint\u2019s Zhang.\n\u201cAlthough the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,\u201d she said.\nIncreasing competition in the Chinese smartphone market is a big concern for Apple, given the company\u2019s China iPhones sales hit $20.8 billion last year, a sizable chunk of their total phone sales of $69.7 billion. Apple\u2019s Chinese smartphone market share also dropped to 15.7%, from 19% a year ago, making it the fourth most sold phone in China, compared to second in 2023.\nApple\u2019s stock took a hit on the news of its sales struggles on Tuesday, sinking over 2.5% by midday. Shares of the big tech giant are now down over 8% year to date after surging 46% in 2023. Weaker-than-forecast iPhone demand, a lack of AI development compared to other Big Tech competitors, the decision to abandon a decade-long bet on EVs, and a $2 billion fine from the European Commission that brought antitrust threats front and center are the main reasons for the weakness.\nEven Wedbush\u2019s tech analyst Dan Ives, a noted Apple bull, admitted that Wall Street\u2019s fears about Apple\u2019s prospects \u201cresemble a horror show right now,\u201d noting that Chinese smartphone demand is \u201cvery sluggish\u201d at the moment.\nThe veteran analyst remains bullish about Apple over the long term, however, due to \u201cpent-up demand\u201d for smartphone upgrades, which should lead to 270 million unit sales for the iPhone 16. Ives also believes Apple will begin to compete with its Big Tech rivals in the AI space after ditching its EV dreams.\n\u201cOver the last decade we have been through many challenging periods in the Apple story and we handheld investors through these stormy periods just like today,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is no different and in our view brighter days will be ahead for Apple although right now the China story remains the dark cloud over the name in the near-term.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Apple has agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging CEO Tim Cook misled investors about a steep downturn in iPhone's sales in China that culminated in a jarring revision to the company's revenue forecast.\nThe preliminary settlement filed Friday in Oakland, California, federal court stems from a shareholder lawsuit focused on the way Apple relayed information about how iPhone models released in September 2018 were performing in China, one of the company's biggest markets.\nCook signaled that the new iPhones were off to a good start during an investor conference call in early November 2018, according to the complaint.\nThat reassurance dissolved into a huge letdown on Jan. 2, 2019 when the Cook issued a warning that Apple's revenue for the just-completed quarter would fall $9 billion below management's forecast for the period. What's more, virtually all of the sales drop was traced to weak demand in China.\nIt marked the first time Apple had cut its revenue guidance since the iPhone's release in 2007 and triggered its stock price to plunge 10% in the next day of frenetic trading, wiping out more than $70 billion in shareholder wealth.\nApple vehemently denied Cook deceived investors about the iPhone's sales in China between early November and early January. The Cupertino, California, company maintained that stance in the settlement documents, but said it decided to make the payment after more than four years of legal wrangling to avoid an \u201coverly burdensome, expensive, and distracting\u201d hassle.\nThe settlement was reached through a mediator after U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected Apple's request to dismiss the case and set a Sept. 9 trial date.\nGonzalez Rogers is now being asked to approve the settlement in a hearing scheduled for April 30.\nThousands of shareholders who bought Apple stock in late 2018 could be eligible for a piece of the settlement, which will be distributed from of a pool that will be less than $490 million after lawyers involved in the case are paid. The attorneys plan to seek up to one-fourth, or about $122 million, of the settlement.\nThe $490 million payment represents less than 1% of the $97 billion profit that Apple pocketed during its last fiscal year ended in September. Apple shareholders who have held on to their shares have become wealthier too. Apple's stock price has more than quadrupled from where it stood after Cook's China warning, creating an additional $2 trillion in shareholder wealth.\n"

        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple made a major concession in its battle to protect the dominance of its App Store on iPhones and other devices in Europe on Tuesday, saying developers will be free to distribute their apps directly to consumers.\nApple announced the changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in last week. The changes could dent the high profit margins and steady stream of revenue that Apple has come to rely on from its App store, where it charges developers fees of up to 30%.\nThe changes, which affect only the European Union, come amid continuing criticism from rivals that Apple's compliance efforts are falling short.\nBeginning this spring, software developers operating in Europe will be able to distribute apps to EU customers directly from their own websites instead of through the App Store.\n\"While the App Store won\u2019t be able to be milked as freely, it\u2019s still likely to remain a considerable cash cow for some time as there are strings attached to this peace offering from Apple,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nDevelopers must still meet terms and conditions set by Apple and be authorized developers. Apple has also introduced a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account each year, even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system.\nThe DMA aims to rein in Apple, Amazon, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\"To reflect the DMA\u2019s changes, users in the EU can install apps from alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4 and later. Users will be able to download an alternative marketplace app from the marketplace developer\u2019s website,\" Apple said on its website. IOS refers to the software platform that runs Apple's iPhones and iPads.\nThe opening in Europe of Apple's ecosystem, which the company has long guarded as a highly profitable \"walled garden,\" comes at a sensitive time for the tech giant.\nThe iPhone maker is struggling with shrinking revenue and weak demand for its smartphones in China. In January, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging its Big Tech rivals in their race to dominate artificial-intelligence technology.\nApple's stock was up 0.6% on Tuesday afternoon, reducing its loss in 2024 to 10%.\nChanges announced on Tuesday include letting developers set up alternative app marketplaces to offer a catalogue solely made up of the developer's own apps with immediate effect.\nDevelopers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their website instead of using Apple's template.\nUnder pressure from regulators and the DMA, Apple last week took a step back in its feud with Epic Games, allowing it to put its own game store on iPhones and iPads in Europe. DMA violations can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global turnover.\nApple has also said it will appeal an EU antitrust fine of 1.84 billion euros ($2.01 billion) handed to it last week for thwarting competition from Spotify and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on the App Store.\n($1 = 0.9158 euro)\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco and by Jaspreet Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Mark Potter, Matthew Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs AAPL Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.55.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) - Apple on Monday unveiled a pair of new MacBook Air laptops with its latest M3 processors, betting that the more powerful models would attract consumers looking to upgrade to artificial intelligence-powered personal computers.\nThe new MacBook Air models come with 13-inch and 15-inch screen sizes and are up to 60% faster than the model with Apple's M1 processor, the company said on its website.\nPrices for the smaller model start at $1,099 in the United States, while the base version of the bigger MacBook Air costs $1,299.\nBoth are available for order from Monday, with deliveries set to begin later this week, said Apple, which has since 2020 used its own chip after parting ways with Intel.\nThe introduction of AI-enabled PCs is expected to help drive a recovery in the PC market in 2024 after a more than two-year, post-pandemic slump.\nIts Mac sales were up slightly at $7.78 billion in the last reported quarter after slumping by a third in the previous quarter.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Title": "Apple MacBook Air 2024 review: The best keeps getting better",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) MacBook Air is one of the best laptops on the market. From its stylish design to its powerful performance and long-lasting battery, it\u2019s hard to top what Apple has to offer. Well, except if you\u2019re looking for a Windows laptop.\nBut if you\u2019re an Apple fan, or are curious about switching to the other side, the MacBook Air is, generally, the way to go. And that\u2019s no different with the company\u2019s newest 15-inch variety. After spending a few days with the 2024 MacBook Air 15-inch, I can say it\u2019s better than ever. But it still has one nagging downside: a lack of connectivity ports on its right side.\nAvailable March 8, the latest Air lineup gets a processor bump from Apple\u2019s M2 processor to the newer M3. The smaller 13-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch starts at $1,299.\nBoth are available in a midnight color that features the same anodized seal that helps cut down on fingerprint smudges, something I wish my 2023 15-inch midnight MacBook Air had. I know it\u2019s not that big of a deal, but when you\u2019re spending north of $1,000 on something you touch every day, you want it to keep looking as clean as the day you bought it.\nMy review unit came equipped with Apple\u2019s 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU M3 chip, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage for $1,699. And if you\u2019re in the market for the 15-inch Air, that\u2019s the exact configuration I\u2019d recommend you buy. It\u2019ll get you enough performance to last a long time thanks to its 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage should be enough for a game here and there, as well as your photos and videos.\nIf you want to go all out, though, you can boost the memory to 24GB and storage to 2TB for $2,499. That said, for the same price, you could get a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a more powerful M3 Pro chip, 18GB of memory, and 512GB of storage.\nIf you want to do some basic photo and video editing and light gaming, stick with the Air. But if you\u2019re interested in heavy-duty photo and video work, gaming, and working on 3D modeling software, the Pro is the way to go.\nAs far as overall performance goes, Apple says the latest Air outpaces last year\u2019s model with 20% faster CPU performance than the M2 Air and 35% better performance than the M1-equipped model. Graphics also get a boost, with the M3 Air beating out the M2 and M1 models with 20% and 65% better performance, respectively.\nI\u2019m writing this review with the M3-powered Air, and I haven\u2019t seen any slowdown or hiccups. It opens apps quickly, springs to life when I lift the lid, and manages to run the game \u201cBaldur\u2019s Gate 3\u201d relatively well on low to medium graphics settings. It doesn\u2019t look as good as it would on, say, a dedicated gaming desktop or console, but if you\u2019re looking to toss fireballs at goblins on the go, the Air will get the job done.\nThe latest MacBook Airs also now support two external displays when you close their lids. So if you want to just use your Air as more or less a computing box and work off of those separate screens and a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse, you can do just that. Disconnect your Air from the setup and you can get going with ease.\nBattery life is as fantastic as you\u2019d expect from an Air running on one of Apple\u2019s chips. The company says it managed to ring out 18 hours of battery life from the Air while playing back 1080p video via iTunes. I\u2019ve used this review unit to write, browse the web, check out some video games, and more, and the battery never touched the red line.\nOf course, I kept recharging it every time I sat down at my makeshift workstation in my apartment\u2019s kitchen/living room/dining room area, but when I did take it for a spin to another room, I never felt the need to bring a charger with me.\nOne of the things that stands out about the M3-powered MacBook Air is the way Apple is positioning it as an AI machine. The company refers to the Air as the \u201cworld\u2019s best consumer laptop for AI,\u201d thanks to the M3\u2019s built-in neural engine. It\u2019s important to note that Apple has included neural engines in its chips for quite some time already, so the neural engine in the M3 isn\u2019t exactly some kind of new development.\nIt\u2019s more that by highlighting it, Apple is telling the world that it\u2019s been building AI-capable laptops, desktops, and smartphones for years, while Windows laptops are only just beginning to embrace AI via Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Copilot and AI-enabled chips from Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) on or coming to market this year.\nMy only real critique of the MacBook Air is that it only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports on its left side. It seems like a minor complaint, but having the ports, which are compatible with rounded USB-C connectors, on only one side can make cable management difficult, especially if you\u2019re used to having a connector on your system\u2019s right side. I had to rearrange my home setup to get comfortable with my review unit, for instance.\nOverall, Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Air builds on the success of its prior offerings and continues to carry the torch as one of the best laptops you can buy. If you\u2019ve already got an M1 or M2-powered Air, you\u2019re fine holding on to your unit for a while longer. If you\u2019re still working with an Intel-based Air, though, it\u2019s time to ditch that dinosaur for an Air with one of Apple\u2019s chips.\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Apple is continuing to offer last year\u2019s 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip at a starting price of $999. You don\u2019t get the slick fingerprint-reducing paint job or the ability to use two external monitors, but it\u2019s still a fantastic laptop.\nIf you\u2019d rather grab an M3-powered MacBook Air, though, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

The company was hit with a \u20ac1.8 billion fine this month for shutting out music streaming rivals from offering cheaper deals. Apple is appealing the penalty and has said that regulators failed to uncover any \u201ccredible evidence of consumer harm.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the company may face a full-blown investigation under the EU\u2019s new rules for Big Tech \u2014 the Digital Markets Act \u2014 which went into force earlier this month.

        "Author": "  Foo Yun Chee ",
        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Brussels on Monday fined Apple 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store, the iPhone maker's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.\nA basic penalty of 40 million euros was inflated by a huge lump sum included as a deterrent - a first for the European Union's antitrust authorities.\nThe European Commission charged Apple last year with preventing Swedish streaming service Spotify and others from informing users of payment options outside its App Store, following a 2019 complaint by Spotify.\nIt said on Monday Apple's restrictions constituted unfair trading conditions, a relatively novel argument in an antitrust case and also used by the Dutch antitrust agency in a decision against Apple in 2021 in a case brought by dating app providers. It ordered it to stop such conduct.\nApple said it would appeal the decision. A ruling at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, is likely to take several years. Until then, Apple will have to pay the fine and comply with the EU order.\nApple shares were down 3.2% at $173.88 on Monday afternoon.\nThe fine was nearly four times the 500 million euros sources with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters they expected the European Commission to impose on Apple.\nIt comprised a basic element of 40 million euros - described by European Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager as a \"parking ticket\" for the U.S. tech giant - plus 1.8 billion euros slapped on top as a deterrent. The 1.84 billion euros total is equal to 0.5% of Apple's global turnover, she said.\nApple criticised the decision, saying in a statement it\" was reached despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast\".\n\"The primary advocate for this decision \u2014 and the biggest beneficiary \u2014 is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,\" it said.\n'LEFT IN THE DARK'\n\"Millions of European music streaming users were left in the dark about all available options,\" Vestager told a press conference.\n\"And Apple's anti-steering rules also made consumers pay more for such services because of the high commission fee imposed on developers and passed on to consumers.\"\nSpotify cheered the EU decision but said there were other issues in other areas.\n\"And while we are pleased that this case delivers some justice, it does not solve Apple's bad behaviour towards developers beyond music streaming in other markets around the world,\" the company said in a statement.\nAlthough the fine is big, Apple can handle it without any immediate cash impact, said analyst Ryan Reith at tech and services company IDC.\nBut he added: \"I believe this is another step in the on-going process of breaking down some of the walled gardens that Apple has created around its ecosystem.\"\nIn the past decade, the EU regulator has fined Alphabet's Google a total 8.25 billion euro over three cases.\nVestager's order to Apple to remove its App Store restrictions echoes the same requirement under new EU tech rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which Apple has to be in compliance with on March 7.\nIn contrast to the music streaming case, Apple is seeking to settle another EU antitrust investigation by offering to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment systems to rivals.\nEU regulators, who subsequently sought feedback from rivals and users, will likely accept its offer without fining the company.\n($1 = 0.9217 euro)\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in BrusselsEditing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Matthew Lewis)\n"

According to Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings report for 2024, company revenue is up 3%, while quarterly earnings per diluted share are up 16% year-over-year. But what if you invested $1,000 over a decade ago?\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead Next: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nOn March 9, 2012, Apple announced plans to reinstate its dividend. The day after, shares traded for around $600 each. If your broker allowed the purchase of fractional shares back then, you could have bought one and two-thirds shares for $1,000, according to The Motley Fool. Since then, Apple split its stock twice: 7-for-1 in 2014 and 4-for-1 in 2020. Consequently, you\u2019d have 46 and two-thirds shares today from the original $1,000 purchase. Today, those shares would be worth $8,700.\nBut, if you reinvested your $361.65 in dividend payments over the past 14 years, The Fool said you\u2019d now have 55 shares worth approximately $10,300.\nLearn More: If You Had Invested $10K in GameStop and AMC in 2021, Here\u2019s How Much You\u2019d Have Today\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA.

Two segments have also recently given Apple\u2019s sales and profits a boost: services and wearables, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily. In December, Apple\u2019s services revenue increased 11% to $23.1 billion, and hardware sales rose to $96.5 billion. Apple\u2019s services include the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and other offerings.\nThe company is also cash-rich with modest debt. The Fool pointed out that Apple has a market capitalization of just under $3 trillion, and it\u2019s the most profitable company in the world. On top of the company\u2019s net income of $97 billion last fiscal year, it has a little over $60 billion worth of cash or highly liquid cash-like holdings in its books. In terms of debt, the company has less than $100 billion in long-term debt, and $49 billion in other long-term liabilities. While this is a huge amount of debt, it\u2019s not bad for a company of Apple\u2019s size.\nThe Fool also noted that the company\u2019s business model is evolving from a focus on devices to a cultural and solutions-oriented one. Apple is expanding its digital ecosystem, which drives hardware and software sales, so we could see a shift in the growth of its services branch.\nAnother reason to invest in Apple: it\u2019s Apple. There may be declines over the short term, but the company has built one of the most loyal fanbases in the world over decades, and those fans are unlikely to vanish overnight.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nI'm a Shopping Expert: 9 Items I'd Never Put in My Grocery Cart\n5 Used Cars You Shouldn't Buy\nAvoid This Simple Banking Mistake That Could Cost You Over $1,000\n6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: If You Invested $1,000 in Apple Stock in 2012, It Would Be Worth This Much Today\n"

A day before, Bloomberg reported that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google was in talks to license its Gemini AI engine to Apple Inc.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBiden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows\nTrump\u2019s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World\u2019s 500 Richest People\nJapan Amps Up Intervention Threat as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990\nTrump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million\nUsing Your Premium Credit Card May Cost More After Visa-Mastercard Deal\nThe moves suggest that despite pouring billions of dollars into partnerships, investments and product development, Microsoft and Google are struggling to figure out how to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence. Neither company is moving fast enough to field consumer products that generate revenue and grab market share, and, despite their size and power, they remain vulnerable to being disrupted.\nEven as engineers labor to perfect the large language models undergirding the technology, the companies are forming alliances and scouring the world for talent and promising startups.\nForging a leading position in generative AI requires each of the tech giants to assemble various ingredients\u2014computing power, top-of-the-line AI models, trustworthy and easy-to-use products and ways of getting them to people. None of the tech giants has all of the ingredients. Google, once the pioneer in large language models, keeps releasing products with worrying errors and biases. Microsoft got a head start with exclusive access to many of OpenAI\u2019s ground-breaking models, but has never been skilled at building exciting consumer products besides video games.\nApple is years behind in artificial intelligence and, to shore up its capabilities in China, the company is in exploratory talks with Baidu Inc. about using the Chinese company\u2019s AI technology in devices sold there, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. On the plus side, Apple sells the world\u2019s most popular smartphone, and its App Store serves as a distribution platform for millions of apps. The company plans to announce an AI comeback strategy in June.\n\u201cEven large tech companies and cloud providers, with their vast resources, cannot innovate the entire generative AI ecosystem single handedly,\u201d said Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs. \u201cCompanies must constantly be on the lookout for the best talent and technology to fill gaps in their portfolios.\u201d\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella isn\u2019t satisfied with his team\u2019s efforts to create consumer products, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Over the past year, the company has baked AI into the Bing search engine, Windows, Office and other products\u2014creating various digital assistants under the new Copilot brand. Yet Bing has made few gains against search market leader Google, and the other products are works in progress. Though OpenAI has given Microsoft a first mover advantage, the startup is focused on the underlying technology not developing products for the software giant.\nThat\u2019s why Nadella recruited Suleyman to be executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft AI, along with Inflection AI co-founder Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, who will become chief scientist of the new unit. Nadella wanted someone to unify and oversee product development and believes he found that person in Suleyman, with whom he bonded during conversations about how AI could be tailored to individual users.\n\u201cReally all we\u2019re trying to do is craft a true end-to-end product experience, so the user feels that there is a seamless, fluid, human-like conversational interaction,\u201d Suleyman said in an interview Monday. He likened the work to sculpting and said \u201cthat art requires you to know the real sweet spot of when a piece of technology is ready and how to dress the experience so that it has an essence and a character which is familiar and accessible and trusted.\u201d\nNadella also knows that because AI will completely transform the industry, even Microsoft\u2019s flagship products aren\u2019t immune to disruption\u2014whether by a peer like Google or a startup that hasn\u2019t even been invented yet. \u201cThese businesses are big and they\u2019re all going to get re-litigated, right?\u201d Nadella said in an interview. \u201cSo even the incumbents can\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d\nNadella\u2019s faith in Suleyman isn\u2019t universally shared. During his time at Google\u2019s DeepMind, Suleyman wasn\u2019t focused on consumer products. At Inflection AI, he oversaw the development of a chatbot called Pi that was designed to interact with users in a more human and supportive fashion. But despite attracting a million active daily users, the startup never found a business case. Suleyman was also accused of treating DeepMind employees poorly. He has acknowledged making mistakes and says he learned from the experience. Still, it\u2019s unclear how well he\u2019ll mesh with Microsoft\u2019s existing team.\nThe proposed partnership between Google and Apple is still being worked out so there are few details of how exactly it would work. But assuming the deal comes to fruition, it could help each company with their AI efforts.\nSince early last year, Apple has been testing its own large language model codenamed Ajax, according to people familiar with the situation. Some employees also have been trying out a basic chatbot dubbed Apple GPT. But Apple\u2019s technology remains inferior to tools from Google and other rivals, according to the people, making a partnership look like the better option. Apple could ultimately team up with another company, including OpenAI, or several.\nGoogle has raced to weave AI into its products, but the company has been dogged by concerns that it\u2019s been too slow to capitalize on the shift in the market and has been playing catch up to Microsoft. Last month, the company pulled an image generator amid a flurry of criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race. A deal with Apple would be Google\u2019s highest-profile partnership for Gemini to date and could be a major boon for the company\u2019s AI efforts. Apple has more than 2 billion devices in active use that could potentially become home to Google Gemini later this year.\nPushing Google\u2019s AI tools to as many devices as possible could help make them the ones users turn to reflexively, as they do with the company\u2019s search engine, creating a virtuous cycle whereby the programs become sharper and sharper with additional user data. Earlier this year, Google struck a deal with Samsung Electronics Co. to incorporate its Gemini technology into the South Korean company\u2019s phones, offering a glimpse of how Google could leverage its relationships with Android device manufacturers in the age of generative AI.\nIndustry observers expect tech companies to continue collaborating and investing in startups to augment their services and avoid being disrupted. \u201cThey need each other, especially in a space like AI which requires engineering expertise and lots of computing power,\u201d said Dan Wang, a Columbia Business School professor who teaches innovation and entrepreneurship. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensible way for the large tech companies to spread out the risk.\u201d No one, he added, \u201chas really found a killer application just yet that people are willing to pay for.\u201d\n--With assistance from Mark Bergen, Mark Gurman and Julia Love.\n(Updates with report that Apple is in talks to use Baidu\u2019s AI technology.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley\nIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving\nHong Kong\u2019s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China\nTesla\u2019s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue\nIn This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn\u2019t Classified\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  MICHAEL LIEDTKE, LINDSAY WHITEHURST, FRANK BAJAK and MIKE BALSAMO ",
        "Text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department on Thursday announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones that boxes out competitors, stifles innovation and keeps prices artificially high.\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Apple has monopoly power in the smartphone market and leverages control over the iPhone to \u201cengage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct.\u201d\n\u201cApple has locked its consumers into the iPhone while locking its competitors out of the market,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Stalling the advancement of the very market it revolutionized, she said, it has \"smothered an entire industry.\u201d\nApple called the lawsuit \u201cwrong on the facts and the law\u201d and said it \u201cwill vigorously defend against it.\u201d\nThe suit takes aim at how Apple allegedly molds its technology and business relationships to \u201cextract more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses, and merchants, among others.\"\nThat includes diminishing the functionality of non-Apple smartwatches, limiting access to contactless payment for third-party digital wallets and refusing to allow its iMessage app to exchange encrypted messaging with competing platforms.\nIt specifically seeks to stop Apple from undermining technologies that compete with its own apps -- in areas including streaming, messaging and digital payments -- and prevent it from continuing to craft contracts with developers, accessory makers and consumers that let it \u201cobtain, maintain, extend or entrench a monopoly.\u201d\nThe lawsuit \u2014 filed with 16 state attorneys general \u2014 is just the latest example of aggressive antitrust enforcement by an administration that has also taken on Google, Amazon and other tech giants with the stated aim of making the digital universe more fair, innovative and competitive.\n\u201cThe Department of Justice has an enduring legacy taking on the biggest and toughest monopolies in history,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, head of the antitrust division, at a press conference announcing the lawsuit. \"Today we stand here once again to promote competition and innovation for next generation of technology.\u201d\nAntitrust researcher Dina Srinavasan, a Yale University fellow, compared the lawsuit's significance to the government's action against Microsoft a quarter century ago \u2014 picking a \"tremendous fight\u201d with what has been the world's most prosperous company.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really big deal to go up and punch someone who is acting like a bully and pretending not to be a bully,\u201d she said.\nPresident Joe Biden has called for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to vigorously enforce antitrust statutes. While its stepped-up policing of corporate mergers and questionable business practices has met resistance from some business leaders \u2014 accusing the Democratic administration of overreach \u2014 it\u2019s been lauded by others as long overdue.\nThe case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has assiduously built around the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch to create what is often referred to as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d so its hardware and software can seamlessly offer user-friendly harmony.\nThe strategy has helped Apple attain an annual revenue of nearly $400 billion and, until recently, a market value of more than $3 trillion. But Apple\u2019s shares have fallen by 7% this year even as most of the stock market has climbed to new highs, resulting in long-time rival Microsoft seizing the mantle as the world\u2019s most valuable company.\nApple said the lawsuit, if successful, would \u201chinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect\u201d and would \"set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d\n\u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2014 designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\nApple has defended the walled garden as an indispensable feature prized by consumers who want the best protection available for their personal information. It has described the barrier as a way for the iPhone to distinguish itself from devices running on Google\u2019s Android software, which isn\u2019t as restrictive and is licensed to a wide range of manufacturers.\n\u201cApple claims to be a champion of protecting user data, but its app store fee structure and partnership with Google search erode privacy,\u201d Consumer Reports senior researcher Sumit Sharma said in a statement.\nThe lawsuit complains that Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and that the high margins it earns on each is more than double what others in the industry get. And when users run an internet search, Google gives Apple a \u201csignificant cut\u201d of the advertising revenue those searches generate.\nThe company\u2019s app store also charges developers up to 30 percent of the app\u2019s price for consumers.\nCritics of Apple\u2019s alleged anticompetitive practices have long complained that its claim to prioritize user privacy is hypocritical when profits are at stake. While its iMessage services is sheathed from prying eyes by end-to-end encryption, that protection evaporates the moment someone texts a non-Apple device.\nBut Will Strafach, a mobile security expert, said that while he believes Apple needs reigning in, he's concerned that the Justice Department\u2019s focus on messaging may be misplaced and could weaken security and privacy.\n\u201cI am quite glad that access to SMS messages is restricted,\u201d said Strafach, creator of the Guardian Firewall app.\nHe notes that a number of apps, ostensibly for weather and news, on iPhones have secretly and persistently sent users' GPS data to third parties. Strafach said he is concerned weakened Apple security \"could open the door to stalkerware/spouseware, which is already more difficult to install on Apple devices compared to Android.\u201d\nHowever, prominent critic Cory Doctorow has complained that while Apple has blocked entities like Facebook from spying on its users it runs its \u201cown surveillance advertising empire\u201d that gathers the same kinds of personal data but for its own use.\n\u201cApple has a history of clandestine deals with surveillance giants like Google, and (CEO) Tim Cook gave Uber a slap on the wrist instead of an app store ban when (the ride-sharing company) built a backdoor to spy on iPhone users who had already deleted Uber\u2019s app,\u201d noted Sean O'Brien, founder of Yale's Privacy Lab.\nFears about an antitrust crackdown on Apple\u2019s business model haven't just contributed to the drop in the company\u2019s stock price, there also is concern it lags behind Microsoft and Google in the push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence technology.\nAntitrust regulators made it clear in their complaint that they see Apple's walled garden mostly as a weapon to ward off competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices that have propelled its lofty profit margins while stifling innovation.\n\u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick Garland. Left unchallenged, Apple would \"only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,\u201d he added.\nWilliam Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission who teaches at George Washington University, said he expects the core of Apple\u2019s defense to be that it is not at all a monopoly in the smartphone market. Justice Department lawyers have built a \u201chigh-quality\" argument of harm in the 88-page indictment with \u201cimpressive excerpts from the firm's own documents,\u201d he said.\nBut don't expect a verdict until 2026 \u2014 which means the case could easily drag on with appeals.\nThe case escalates the Biden administration's antitrust siege, which has already triggered lawsuits against Google and Amazon accusing them in engaging in illegal tactics to thwart competition, as well as unsuccessful attempts to block new acquisitions by Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\nIn addition the FTC sued Facebook in 2020 over its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\nKovacic predicts antitrust action by the FTC or Justice Department against Microsoft over its relationship with OpenAI is \u201ccoming up around the corner,\u201d and \u201cthe two agencies are fighting over who will handle that better.\u201d\n\u201cThey foreshadowed this would be their agenda and they're filling out the agenda the way they said,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are all high-stakes matters, and you can expect an intense and aggressive defense.\u201d\nApple's business interests are also entangled in the Justice Department's case against Google, which went to trial last fall and is headed toward final arguments scheduled to begin May 1 in Washington, D.C. In that case, regulators are alleging Google has stymied competition by paying for the rights for its already dominant online search engine to be the automatic place to handle queries on the iPhone and a variety of web browsers in an arrangement that generates an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion annually.\nWith the Justice Department mounting a direct attack across its business, Apple stands to lose even more.\n___\nLiedtke reported from San Francisco.\n"

        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis and Akash Sriram\n(Reuters) -Under pressure from European regulators, Apple took a step back in its feud with Epic Games on Friday, clearing the way for Epic to put its own game store on iPhones and iPads in Europe.\nEarlier this week, Apple had taken steps to block Epic from starting up a store and bringing back the popular game Fortnite, which Apple removed from its App Store in 2020 after Epic broke the iPhone maker's in-app payment rules in protest.\nApple's decision to open its door to Epic follows the European Union's Thursday deadline for Big Tech companies to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a set of rules that bans Apple and Google from controlling which apps are distributed on devices with the iOS and Android operating systems.\nThierry Breton, the EU's industry chief, said regulators had warned Apple about the iPhone maker's move earlier this week to block Epic's potential return.\n\"I take note with satisfaction that following our contacts Apple decided to backtrack its decision on Epic exclusion. From Day 2, #DMA is already showing very concrete results!\" Breton said on the X social media platform.\nEpic and Apple have been in a legal battle since 2020, when the gaming firm alleged that Apple's practice of charging up to 30% commissions on in-app payments on its iOS devices violated U.S. antitrust rules. Epic lost its court battle against Apple, and the game maker's gambit to intentionally break Apple's rules as a protest got it banned from Apple's devices.\nEpic's victory on Friday leaves it well short of everything it wants from Apple.\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney has criticized Apple's plans for complying with the DMA, under which Apple says it still has the right to exclude third-party app marketplaces from its devices under some circumstances. And Fortnite remains unavailable in the App Store in the United States.\nFor its part, Apple is grappling with an erosion of its App Store business model at the same time it has told investors that iPhone sales this quarter will be billions of dollars lower than what Wall Street expected.\nThe most recent tangle between Apple and Epic involved Apple's developer accounts, which are normally a minor but necessary administrative step for developers before selling apps on Apple devices.\nApple on Friday reinstated Epic Games' developer account two days after it had blocked the company from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe.\nThe game developer said it will move on with its plans to bring the Epic Games Store and Fortnite back to iOS in the continent.\n\"This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable,\" Epic Games added.\nApple earlier this week said it had terminated Epic's account because the company's actions made it doubt whether it intended to follow the new rules Apple has set out to comply with the DMA.\n\"Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies. As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program,\" Apple said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri, Marguerita Choy and Daniel Wallis)\n"

        "Text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nHas the \"Magnificent Seven\" become the \"Famous Five\" or even \"Fab Four\"?\nWith one eye on the major macro events of the week, Apple and Tesla's separation from this year's tech-infused stock market buoyancy and their underperformance against the other \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps has become more pointed.\nApple's stock was down almost 2% again ahead of Tuesday's bell after news that iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 - as the U.S. giant faces increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.\nAnd it has been a bad week already for Apple, which dropped 3% on Monday after the European Union fined it 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via curbs on its App Store. It was the iPhone maker's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.\nApple is now down almost 10% for the year to date - underperforming the Nasdaq 100 and S&P500 by about 16%. And even though it is still up 15% over the past 12 months, that's less than a third the gain of the Nasdaq 100.\nTesla's stock woes are even deeper as it faces waning demand for electric vehicles and a price war, with its stock now down almost 25% for 2024. It dropped more than 7% on Monday alone after its sales declined in February in China, where it likely faced a slowdown during the Lunar New Year holidays.\nWith artificial intelligence and related chipmaking the buzz of the year, Google-parent Alphabet has not fared much better - and is down almost 5% for the year.\nWith even the equal-weighted S&P500 up 4% this year, the underperformance is notable.\nExposure to China's stumbling economy, the geopolitical standoff between Washington and Beijing and this year U.S. elections may be common factors.\nChina's mainland stocks edged higher on Tuesday after Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced an ambitious 2024 economic growth target of around 5% on Tuesday, promising steps to transform the country's development model and defuse risks fuelled by bankrupt property developers and indebted cities.\nBut with property and tech sector worries smouldering in the background, Hong Kong's Hang Seng were less impressed - sliding 2.6% and with its tech giants tumbling 4.3%.\nDetails of Tuesday's National People's Congress plan showed China will boost defence spending by 7.2% this year, fuelling a military budget that has more than doubled under President Xi Jinping's 11 years in office as Beijing hardens its stance on Taiwan.\nBack on Wall St, politics was also top of mind on \"Super Tuesday\". Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican presidential caucuses on Monday, according to projections, ahead of a slew of contests where he is expected to strengthen his grip on the party's presidential nomination.\nTrump, who has promised universal 10% import tariffs and bilateral trade tariffs of 60% on China's goods if elected, was handed a major victory on Monday as the U.S. Supreme Court barred states from disqualifying candidates under a constitutional provision involving insurrection. That reversed Colorado's exclusion of him from its ballot.\nElsewhere, bitcoin's almost 60% charge higher this year seemed to stumble at the final hurdle on Tuesday as it balked at 2021's record high near $69,000 and turned tail.\nMicrostrategy fell almost 9% after the bitcoin development company announced a private offering for $600 million in convertible senior notes, with proceeds to be used to buy bitcoin.\nMore broadly, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were in the red again after a dour start to the week.\nAdvanced Micro Devices was off about 3% after a report that the chipmaker hit a U.S. government roadblock in its efforts to sell an AI chip tailored for the Chinese market.\nWith Wednesday's congressional testimony from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell now firmly in view, U.S. Treasury yields were calm and the dollar index was steady.\nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:\n* U.S. Feb service sector surveys from ISM and S&P Global, Jan factory goods orders\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr speaks\n* U.S. Treasury auctions 3-, 6-month bills\n* U.S. corp earnings: Target, Crowdstrike, Greenlight Capital, Ross Stores\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Ed Osmond, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n"

But the company claimed it only selectively restricts the APIs app developers have access to in order to protect user privacy and security. It gave the same reason for why it implements limitations for third-party digital wallets.

As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple\u2019s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,082,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $216,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield.

As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.57%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,060,688 or around 6,250 shares.

        "Author": "  John Csiszar ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett, the billionaire known as the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d and one of our Top 100 Money Experts, is one of the most famous investors in the world. As CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he powered that company\u2019s stock to an incredible 19.8% average annual return from 1965 through 2022, an unbelievable span of 47 years.\nRead Next: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonTry This: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024\nDuring that span, the S&P 500 averaged just 9.9% annually, meaning Buffett and Berkshire more than doubled that return over nearly half a century. For this reason \u2014 and the fact that Buffett is a very quotable public figure \u2014 investors flock to the handful of stocks that he selects for the Berkshire portfolio. One of the most noteworthy in recent years has been Buffett\u2019s investment in Apple, which now comprises a whopping 42.5% of Berkshire\u2019s entire portfolio.\nSo it begs the question: If you had played along with Buffett and invested when he did, how would your returns have looked? Let\u2019s dig in.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nBuffett made waves in the investment world when Berkshire first bought Apple stock in Q1 2016, and then continued and even accelerated his buying throughout 2016 and into 2017. Buffett had long been known for not investing in technology stocks because by his own admission he didn\u2019t really understand them, and he only invests in things he knows.\nBut the famed investor is equally well known for buying good companies at a fair price, and Apple certainly fit the bill. Now, Apple is by far Berkshire\u2019s biggest holding, comprising nearly half of its entire investment portfolio, with a valuation of over $158 billion. That amounts to 5.9% of all of the Apple shares that even exist.\nFind Out: I\u2019m a Financial Advisor: I\u2019d Invest My First $5,000 in These 6 Stocks\nBuffett began buying Apple in the first quarter of 2016, but there\u2019s no way to know exactly what his average share price was. But if you use the highest closing that quarter as a conservative estimate, it means that you would have paid $27.06 per share for Apple.\nOn Mar. 4, 2024, Apple shares closed at $175.10. This means you would have earned a profit of $148.04 per share on your investment, or 547%. Here\u2019s what that translates to in terms of dollars and cents based on different starting investment amounts:\n$100 invested would be worth $647\n$500 invested would be worth $3,235\n$1,000 invested would be worth $6,470\n$5,000 invested would be worth $32,350\n$10,000 invested would be worth $64,700\n$100,000 invested would be worth $647,000\n$39.2 million invested \u2014 the amount of Buffett\u2019s Q1 2016 purchase \u2014 would be worth $263.6 million\nBuffett is a legendary stock picker, and that has gone a long way toward his impressive record of lifelong investment success. But you can apply some of his most basic principles to improve your own portfolio.\nFirst and foremost, Buffett only invests in businesses he understands. If you\u2019re going to be a stock picker like Buffett, you have to do your homework. If not, he recommends that you simply buy an S&P 500 index fund instead.\nBuffett is also famous for saying that his preferred holding period for a stock is \u201cforever.\u201d In other words, Buffett says that investing is a long-term endeavor, so you should avoid trading.\nAs a value investor, Buffett also restricts his investments to those that are a value. When he bought Apple for the first time, for example, it was trading at just 11x earnings, vs closer to 28x as of Mar. 4.\nAdditionally, Buffett only wants to invest in companies that have a \u201cmoat,\u201d or a protective barrier around them that makes it harder for others to compete against it.\nLastly, to succeed in investing, you\u2019ll have to leave your emotions at the door. You\u2019ll have to buy when things look ugly, and sell when they look too good. As Buffett puts it, you want to \u201cbe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d\nPut it all together, and Buffett\u2019s investment philosophy might help guide you to your own successes.\nAt the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Buffett told shareholders that Apple was \u201ca better business than any we own.\u201d He also stated that he would keep buying it as much as he could, going so far as to tell CNBC\u2019s Becky Quick in 2018 that he would love to own 100% of the company. Of course, there are financial and practical reasons why Buffett won\u2019t likely continue to buy huge chunks of Apple.\nFirst, as he told Quick, his ownership automatically goes up every year simply due to the fact that Apple buys back so much of his stock. That reduces the number of shares in existence and increases Berkshire\u2019s percentage ownership of the company.\nSecond, Apple is already nearly half the value of Berkshire\u2019s entire portfolio, at a whopping $158 billion. To meaningfully increase his stake, Buffett would have to pony up a sizable amount of money. But rest assured, if there\u2019s a market crash and/or Apple shares fall to ridiculously cheap levels once again, Buffett will likely step up and buy even more, based on his overall investment philosophy.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Household Products To Always Buy in Bulk at Costco\nAverage Cost of Groceries Per Month: How Much Should You Be Spending?\n7 Things to Do With Your Savings in 2024 to Grow Your Wealth\n4 Reasons You Should Be Getting Your Paycheck Early, According to An Expert\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: If You Invested in Apple When Warren Buffett Did, Here\u2019s How Much You Would Have Made\n"

According to Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings report for 2024, company revenue is up 2%, while quarterly earnings per diluted share are up 16% year-over-year. But what if you invested $1,000 over a decade ago?\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead Next: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nOn March 9, 2012, Apple announced plans to reinstate its dividend. The day after, shares traded for around $600 each. If your broker allowed fractional share trading back then, you could have bought one and two-thirds shares for $1,000, according to The Motley Fool. Since then, Apple split its stock twice: 7-for-1 in 2014 and 4-for-1 in 2020. Consequently, you\u2019d have 46 and two-thirds shares today from the original $1,000 purchase. Today, those shares would be worth $8,700.\n\u201cOver the past 14 years [sic, as the Apple dividend was only reinitiated in 2012], you\u2019d have received $361.65 in dividend payments.

Two business sectors have also recently given Apple\u2019s sales and profits a boost: services and wearables, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily. In December, Apple\u2019s services revenue increased 11% to $23.1 billion, and hardware sales rose to $96.5 billion. Apple\u2019s services include the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and other offerings.\nThe company is also cash-rich with modest debt. The Fool pointed out that Apple has a market capitalization of just under $3 trillion, and it\u2019s the most profitable company in the world. On top of the company\u2019s net income of $97 billion last fiscal year, it also got a little over $60 billion worth of cash or highly liquid cash-like holdings in its books. In terms of debt, the company has less than $100 billion in long-term debt, and $49 billion in other long-term liabilities. While this is a huge amount of debt, it\u2019s not bad for a company of Apple\u2019s size.\nThe Fool also noted that the company\u2019s business model is evolving from a focus on devices to a cultural and solutions-oriented one. Apple is expanding its digital ecosystem, which drives hardware and software sales, so we could see a shift in the growth of its services branch.\nAnother reason to invest in Apple \u2014 it\u2019s Apple. There may be declines over the short term, but the company has built one of the most loyal fanbases in the world over decades, and it\u2019s unlikely to disappear.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nI'm a Shopping Expert: 9 Items I'd Never Put in My Grocery Cart\n9 Ways Frugal Retirees Spend Their Social Security Checks\nAvoid This Simple Banking Mistake That Could Cost You Over $1,000\n6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: If You Invested $1,000 in Apple Stock in 2012, It Would Be Worth This Much Today\n"

        "Author": "  Steve Mollman ",
        "Text": "Tesla rivals Rivian, Lucid, and Fisker were riding high a few years ago. Amid surging investor interest, the electric-vehicle makers commanded hefty market caps and\u00a0spoke of bright futures.\nThings look far less promising today. The EV sector faces a growth slowdown, and even market leader Tesla has warned of challenging months ahead. For its less-established rivals, \"challenging\" doesn't quite cover it.\nLast month, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%. Its market cap has plunged to $11 billion from a 2021 peak of $153 billion.\nGene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, addressed the idea this week of Apple\u2014which recently canned its own EV project\u2014buying Rivian, noting the low valuation. Apple \u201cneeds to break into some new market,\" he told CNBC. \u201cThey need to do something big, and potentially Rivian would be just the answer to that.\u201d\nOf course, that would be an unusual move for Apple. Its most expensive acquisition to date was $3 billion for headphone maker Beats Electronics in 2014. Amazon, which buys delivery vans from Rivian, is the EV maker\u2019s largest shareholder, with about 16% of its hard-hit shares.\nLast month, Musk said of Rivian, \u201cThey need to cut costs massively, and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die.\u201d He suggested the company had about six quarters before going bankrupt.\nLucid, meanwhile, has seen its market cap plummet from a peak of $91.4 billion in 2001 to a $7.6 billion today. Last month, it said it would build only about 9,000 EVs this year\u2014far below the 90,000 it predicted for 2024 three years ago. Its struggles led to speculation last year that Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which holds about 60% of the EV maker, would acquire the rest of it. That didn\u2019t happen.\nAs for Fisker, its market cap stands at $258 million, down from $4.1 billion in 2021.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) says that it is bringing its Omniverse enterprise technology to Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Vision Pro AR/VR headset. The graphics chip giant announced the news during its annual GTC conference in San Jose on Monday.\nThe idea is to let developers use Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse tools in an AR/VR setting via the Vision Pro. Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is a platform that allows programmers to create digital twins of objects and locations that they can use to determine how they\u2019ll behave or look in the real world.\nNvidia says organizations can use its Omniverse tool to create things like factories in a digital space so that they can understand how workers will move around the facility before they ever put shovels into the ground.\nDuring GTC, Nvidia showed how a designer could use a car configuration tool via the Vision Pro to manipulate different aspects of a vehicle and then virtually step into it.\nThe company says it\u2019s able to do this via its Omniverse Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, and its Graphics Delivery Network that streams directly to the Vision Pro via the cloud.\n\u201cApple Vision Pro is the first untethered device which allows for enterprise customers to realize their work without compromise,\u201d Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of simulation, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to our customers having access to these amazing tools.\u201d\nThe move is a win for both Nvidia and Apple. It ensures that Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is available on Apple\u2019s high-end headset and gives Apple\u2019s Vision Pro another enterprise offering.\nApple's $3,499 Vision Pro is too pricy for most consumers, but enterprise customers, for the most part, can more easily swallow that kind of price. Plus, bringing Nvidia's Omniverse technology to the headset makes it a far more attractive purchase.\nWhether that means Apple will see a meaningful sales jump, however, remains to be seen. If it does, it could provide a powerful business line for the Vision Pro and Apple's bottom line.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "Text": "In this article, we will list the 15 best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024. If you want to sip our discussion about Apple's patent infringement, smartwatch market, and smartwatch ownership globally, go to the 7 Best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024.\nA patent infringement case is pushing Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) to stop selling two of the most recent Apple Watch models, Series 9 and Ultra 2. The disputed component in these watches is the blood oxygen technology. The International Trade Center (ITC) ruled on October 2023 that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) has infringed patents for pulse oximetry tech by Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI), a medical device manufacturer. The tech giant is trying to come up with a solution, but it seems like it will be a while before that happens. Given this ban, it is worth looking at some of the best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024.\u00a0\nThe global smartwatch market is growing at a fast rate. It was valued at $33.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $90.4 billion by 2032, growing at a compounding annual growth rate of 10.5% during this period. The convenience of glancing at the wrist to stay informed about messages, calls, and important updates without picking up the phone is one of the biggest reasons for its market growth.\u00a0\nAnother pivotal factor propelling the smartwatch market is health and fitness. These watches provide a holistic approach to health management. They offer features such as heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and workout guidance. However, smartwatches do not come cheap, and their cost is one of the greatest hindrances in the growth of the global market.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are many ways to segment the global smartwatch market, but one of the most common segregation is based on screen type. Currently, these watches are segmented into LCD and OLED according to the screen type, with OLED having a 91% share of the market.OLED has many advantages, which is why it is contributing to the overall growth of the market. Compared to LCD, it offers more vibrant colors and is more energy efficient.\nAnother way to segment smartwatches is based on the application. These segments include running, notification checking, swimming, and cycling. The running segment takes the lion's share of 36%.\u00a0Brand-wise, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) is the largest player in the market with a 20% market share. Other major players include Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) and Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN). \u00a0\nFossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) was founded in 1984 and went public in 1990. The company has been at the forefront of smartwatch technology, recently launching exclusive smartwatch capabilities like next-gen touchscreen technology and advancements in hybrid smartwatches. However, it is worth noting that Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) recently announced quitting the smartwatches market.\u00a0\nGramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) is a prominent company known for its innovative products and solutions. The company is known for its continuous innovation in the smartwatch industry. Some of the most popular smartwatches by Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) include the Gramin Venu 2, which ranks quite high on our list of the 15 best Apple watch alternatives in 2024.\u00a0\nCurrently, more than 200 million people use smartwatch globally. Like smartphone ownership in the US, men have a slight advantage as 23% of them use a smartwatch compared to 21.8% of women. It is worth noting here that ownership is the highest among internet users aged 25 to 34. Interestingly, within this age group, women are more likely to own a smartwatch. Of all internet-using people aged 25 to 34, 27.2% of women use a smartwatch as opposed to 26.9% of men.\u00a0\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 15 best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024.\u00a0\nA marathon runner wearing a company branded smartwatch, monitoring his performance in real-time.\nTo curate our list of the 15 best Apple watch alternatives in 2024, we consulted 5 (1,2,3,4,5) sources. In our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the watch appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of watches in our sources. So, we devised the following calculation, which we call the ranking factor: 15/ (sum of rankings*100). Our final Insider Monkey score was calculated by adding the frequency and the ranking factor. The higher this score, the higher the watch ranks on our list.\u00a0\nThe ranking factor is designed in a way that it is always positive but less than 1. So, if the Insider Monkey score of watch A is 3.75, 3 is its frequency, whereas 0.75 is its ranking factor. For comparison, if watch B had an Insider Monkey Score of 4.40, its frequency is 4, but overall it ranked lower than watch A on our sources. However, since we prioritize frequency, watch B ranks higher on our list.\u00a0\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\nAmazfit T Rex 2 is one of the best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024.

        "Text": "For many investors, Apple\u2019s stock is the definition of \u201cthe one that got away.\u201d Some of those who saw its potential during the company\u2019s early days could have made millions in returns. Even during the past 10 years, Apple investors could have made significant profits as the stock\u2019s value rose tenfold.\nBe Aware: Warren Buffett Sold His Apple Stock \u2013 Here\u2019s WhyFind Out: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024\nSo, how much Apple stock would someone need to have bought 10 years ago to be able to retire today?\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nThe first step to figuring out how much money you need to retire is to figure out how much you\u2019ll have to spend yearly once you stop working. This is important, because that sum dictates how much you\u2019ll need to withdraw from your savings every year during retirement.\nThe AARP recommends that retirees should assume they\u2019ll need around 80% of their current income every year. This is because you\u2019ll no longer have many of the costs associated with work, such as payroll taxes or 401(k) contributions.\nLearn More: $2 Million in Retirement Savings: Here\u2019s How Much You Could Withdraw Per Year\nOnce you know how much money you\u2019ll need to withdraw from your retirement account, you can use something known as the 4% rule. This strategy says that retirees who invest in a portfolio consisting of 50% bonds and 50% stocks can withdraw 4% of their retirement funds annually, and they\u2019ll be unlikely to run out of money during their lifetime.\nThis rule is good for getting a ballpark estimate, but you should always consult with a financial advisor before making such a serious financial decision. How much you need to save may depend on your specific expenses and assets. A financial advisor can help you calculate a retirement savings target based on your specific situation and risk tolerance.\nSo, how much would the average American need to be able to retire? According to the 2022 Census, the annual median income in the U.S. was $75,149. Adjusting for inflation, that would be $82,948 in 2024. Following the 80% recommendation, the average American should aim to withdraw $66,358 annually during retirement. Dividing this number by 4% provides an estimate of how much they should save for retirement:\n$66,358 / 0.04 = $1,658,950\nThis means that the average American should be able to maintain their quality of life in retirement if they have about $1.7 million in savings.\nAs of market closing on March 28, 2024, the current price of Apple\u2019s stock was $173.31. The stock has repeatedly gone above $190 within the past year, though it has never been able to break resistance at $200.\nTen years ago, at market close on March 28, 2014, Apple\u2019s stock was trading at $16.85 per share. This means that $100,000 invested in Apple in March 2014 would be worth more than $1 million today.\nHow much would you need to have invested in Apple 10 years ago to retire today? Take the previous estimate of the retirement savings you would need based on the median U.S. income, and compare that with the 10-year return for Apple\u2019s stock:\n$16.85 / $173.31 * $1,658,950 = $161,290.79\nThis means that if you had invested $161,291 in Apple stock in 2014, you would now have enough to maintain the lifestyle of the average American in retirement.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Expensive Costco Items That Are Definitely Worth the Cost\nI Was Retired, but Wasted Big Money On These 3 Things and Had To Go Back To Work\n5 Reasons You Should Consider an Annuity For Your Retirement Savings\n10 New Cars to Avoid Buying in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: If You Invested $161K in Apple 10 Years Ago, You Could Retire Today\n"

        "Title": "Intel's Lunar Lake Could Be a Threat to Apple's MacBooks",
        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), by virtue of controlling both the hardware and software for its MacBooks, can eke out performance and efficiency that Windows laptops generally cannot. Apple's switch from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) CPUs to its own homegrown CPUs has given it even more firepower to widen the gap between its products and the competition.\nIntel made progress closing that gap with its Meteor Lake laptop chips, which launched in December. Meteor Lake, a disaggregated chip that links together multiple tiles, uses the company's Intel 4 process node for its compute tile and includes capable graphics and an AI accelerator. Performance is solid, and while battery life isn't quite as good as Apple's MacBook Air, it's a step in the right direction.\nLater this year, Intel is expected to launch two lines of CPUs. Arrow Lake will focus on the desktop and performance, while Lunar Lake will succeed Meteor Lake in laptops.\nIntel is reportedly doing a few interesting things with Lunar Lake. While the company hasn't disclosed much information, various reports and rumors suggest that Lunar Lake is aimed at bringing Apple-like performance and efficiency to Windows laptops.\nLunar Lake will reportedly include integrated memory, just like Apple's chips. In a standard Windows laptop, the CPU and memory are separate. The need to move data from memory to the CPU can create performance bottlenecks, increase power consumption, and boost heat.\nBy putting the CPU and memory together, significant performance and efficiency gains can be achieved. The downside is that laptops with memory integrated into the CPU can't be upgraded. One reason why Apple's MacBooks generally beat Windows laptops in performance and efficiency is this integrated memory design.\nOf course, Apple has gotten pretty good at designing chips as well. On top of Lunar Lake's integrated memory, reports indicate that Intel is working closely with Microsoft to optimize Lunar Lake for Windows 11.\nLunar Lake will also reportedly feature upgraded integrated graphics using Intel's next-generation Battlemage architecture, as well as an upgraded AI accelerator. While Meteor Lake used Intel's manufacturing for the compute tile and TSMC for the other tiles, rumors suggest that Intel is opting for TSMC for everything this time around.\nThis could be an issue of timing. The Intel 18A process won't be ready in time, and with Arrow Lake set to use the Intel 20A process, Intel may not have enough capacity to use its own advanced processes for both chip families. The company will reportedly be using TSMC's N3B process node for the compute tile.\nDemand for PCs plunged after the pandemic-era boom sputtered out. Global unit shipments dropped by a double-digit percentage in both 2022 and 2023, a miserable result that caused Intel's revenue and profit to tumble. The market is expected to recover this year, which bodes well for Intel's 2024 CPU launches.\nWith Lunar Lake, Intel will have the opportunity to steal back some market share it's lost to rival AMD, as well as help Windows laptops gain ground on Apple. AMD now has a roughly 20% unit share of the laptop CPU market, a percentage that has more than doubled since mid-2018.\nThere are still a lot of unknowns about Lunar Lake, as most of the information available hasn't been confirmed by Intel. But if the company can truly close the performance and efficiency gap with Apple, Lunar Lake could be a big winner for Intel as it rides the PC recovery.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia on cusp of overtaking Apple as second-most-valuable company",
        "Author": "  Medha Singh ",
        "Text": "By Medha Singh\n(Reuters) - Nvidia is nipping at the heels of Apple to become the world's second-most-valuable company, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.\nAn AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company's valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months, overtaking Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco on the way.\nNvidia's market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft by about $645 billion.\nThe relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark S&P 500 index.\nNvidia, which is up 95%, and Meta Platforms, which is up 46.6% so far this year, have also outperformed shares of other members of the so-called Magnificient 7, highlighting investors' insatiable appetite for everything AI.\n\"Nvidia's rally reflects the incredibly strong fundamentals underlying its current business model,\" said Richard Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\"It is also finding strong speculative support as a favorite among long option buyers who have seen almost a straight upward climb throughout 2024.\"\nMeanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January.\nIn recent weeks, Nvidia also replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.\nThe stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is lower than where it was a year ago despite the stock's strong run as analysts raised its profit estimates.\nBy comparison, Intel's PE multiple is 30.24 and that of Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is 39.6, LSEG data showed.\n\"Nvidia is in fact the cheapest of the \"AI narrative\" stocks out there,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.\n\"We continue to believe that in five years or 10 years we will all be talking about an industry that is far larger than the numbers being bandied about today.\"\nHowever, there are signs Nvidia stock is nearing a peak.\nOver the next 12 months, Wall Street analysts' median target price implies Nvidia would trade at $850 per share, below the last closing price of $926, LSEG data showed.\n\"Of course, it is very difficult for any mega-cap stock's price to continue to grow at this pace as the law of large numbers eventually comes into play. But the stock price could remain at these levels if the company can continue to meet or exceed the high expectations of analysts,\" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n"

To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2234701/alphabet-is-on-sale-will-buffett-buy-shares\nWelcome to Episode #360 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n(0:30) - Should You Buy More of The Magnificent 7?\n(8:00) - If Warren Buffett Buys Apple, Should You Buy Too?\n(32:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, GOOGL, BRK.B\n Podcast@Zacks.com\n Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\nThere is a lot of angst on Wall Street about the stocks of Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL this year. Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits.\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four linchpins of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s business.\nBuffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.\nIt may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple\u2019s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024.\nApple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It\u2019s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2.\nApple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It\u2019s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple\u2019s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38.\nBuffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.\nBuffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.\nDoes Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a \u201cmoat.\u201d\nAlphabet\u2019s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.\nBuffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast for Tracey\u2019s analysis of Alphabet\u2019s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Can Nvidia Rally 21% and Surpass Apple to Become the Second Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock?",
        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "March 8 was a wild day in the stock market. Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged to an all-time high of $974 only to fall over 10% from that high to end the day at $875.28. At the peak, Nvidia was less than 9% away from surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in market cap. By close, it was a little over 20% away.\nGiven Nvidia's big swings, it seems like the stock could very well surpass Apple to become the second most valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" stock behind Microsoft. Here's why Nvidia could keep outperforming Apple in the short term, but why Apple is the better long-term buy.\nNvidia is not an unprofitable growth stock that is rallying based on optimism and greed alone (although those are contributing factors). The business is doing phenomenally well, achieving a level of sales and earnings growth paired with margin expansion.\nThe only concern with Nvidia is its valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on its trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings is 73.6. But consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) to more than double from the $11.90 it earned in fiscal 2024 to $24.50 in fiscal 2025. That gives Nvidia a forward P/E of 35.7 -- which is far more reasonable.\nThe easiest way for Nvidia to pass Apple in market cap is for investors to keep bidding up the stock. But the more realistic way is if Nvidia's earnings live up to expectations.\nNvidia will report its full-year fiscal 2025 results some time in late February or early March next year. If it reports $24.50 in earnings, the stock would likely be far higher, especially if there is optimism for even more growth ahead. A business that is more than doubling earnings with high margins and leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution deserves a premium valuation, probably something like double the P/E of the S&P 500.\nNvidia deserves the highest P/E of all the Magnificent Seven companies, but the company is nearing a point where it is running up too far, too fast.\nNvidia benefited from earnings growth and a valuation expansion. It's hard to assume the valuation will continue to expand, but the stock could still go up if the first half of fiscal 2025 goes as analysts expect. Each new quarter of high earnings will increase the trailing-12-month number and lower the P/E, leaving room for the stock to rise to fill the gap. There is nothing better in the stock market than earnings growth, and right now Nvidia has it, and Apple doesn't.\nSo why is Apple the better buy if Nvidia has such an easy path forward? Simply put, I think the setup for Apple makes it a much better investment. Nvidia may be the better trade, but a more surefire way of building wealth is by compounding over the long term.\nMarket sentiment is negative toward Apple. So negative, in fact, that Apple trades at a discount to the S&P 500. The only reason that should ever happen is if something serious was going wrong with Apple. The company has its challenges, but none of them warrant an underperformance like we have been seeing for the last six months or so.\nThe abridged version of why Apple stock is under pressure is because it hasn't captured the spotlight with some major AI monetization announcement (Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms have). iPhone sales are down in China, and growth is sluggish in general. But Apple has endured these periods before and overcome competition.\nPiper Sandler's fall 2023 survey found that 87% of Gen Z had an iPhone, 88% expected their next phone to be an iPhone, and 34% owned an Apple Watch. The\u00a0iPhone is essentially a consumer staple in the U.S. and is growing well across international markets outside of China.\nInvestors should focus less on the competition and more on Apple's ability to further monetize its existing devices through services and AI. The key for Apple has always been to increase the depth (services) and breadth (more products like phones, computers, tablets, wearables, ear buds, and more) of its ecosystem. Having lifetime customers consistently increase their spending relies on product improvements.\nThe pressure is on Apple to make a splash this summer to drive iPhone demand and upgrades. If Apple delivers the improvements that drive growth, the stock could soar. But even if it doesn't, it generates plenty of extra cash to make an acquisition and grow that way, or return cash to shareholders while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.\nApple's brand, market position, and financial health give it the time and the wiggle room needed to make mistakes. The company is known for not leading investors on and only makes announcements when it feels the product or service is ready.\nNvidia has to hit sky-high earnings forecasts to keep going up. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, and a downturn in customer spending could stall its growth trajectory. Nvidia may keep growing at a breakneck pace in the near term, but eventually, it will slow down. When that time comes, investors may be less willing to give Nvidia a multiple that is triple the market average.\nMeanwhile, Apple is already a good value and has a clear path toward regaining Wall Street's favor.\nI don't have a crystal ball, but if I had to guess, I would say Nvidia will briefly become more valuable than Apple. But three to five years from now, I think Apple will be worth more than Nvidia while also being a safer and less volatile investment.\nNvidia stands out as a high-risk/high-potential-reward play, while Apple is more like a low-risk/medium-potential-reward investment. Investors who are confident about sustained high demand for Nvidia's products will want to watch each quarterly earnings report, understanding the importance earnings play in the story. The big gains have already been made in Nvidia, and investors should expect more reasonable returns going forward.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Analyst unveils Google stock price target after Apple rumors",
        "Author": "  Todd Campbell ",
        "Text": "While Google is a search engine Goliath, the performance of the stock of its parent, Alphabet, has trailed that of its large-cap technology peers because of concern that artificial intelligence will reshape the search market.\nThere's little debate that AI apps are changing how people consume and digest information\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but there's also little to suggest that Alphabet's search dominance is over.\nAlphabet's market share remains intact despite the widespread availability of large language models for searching and creating content, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Bing.\nNevertheless, the risk that AI could cut into Google's lead has led to analysts to revisit their opinions and update their stock-price targets.\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\nChatGPT became the fastest app to reach one million users after its launch in December 2022. Since then, everyone has been considering how AI could transform how businesses and people engage with information.\nIndividuals are using generative AI apps to find and create more relevant insight, banks are using it to hedge risks, retailers are evaluating whether it can stop theft, and the military is studying how it may affect the battlefield.\nRelated: Apple's AI plans reportedly could involve a partner like Google\nThe potential for AI to unlock better outcomes by intelligently crafting responses from previously siloed datasets has sparked a tidal wave of investment into training and running increasingly more robust AI solutions.\nThose solutions will likely affect the search market but might not derail Google's dominance.\nFor example, despite ChatGPT and Microsoft's AI solutions, including Bing and Copilot, being readily available, Google appears to have insulated itself from these challengers via its solution, Gemini (formerly Bard).\nAccording to Similarweb,\u00a0over the past six months, the market shares of ChatGPT and Microsoft search and AI chatbot have inched up 0.32% to 0.14% to 1.84% and 1.44%, respectively.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Google\u2019s market share outside China has remained at nearly 92%.\nThe ability to maintain share may stem largely from Google working quickly to launch Gemini and deploy AI tools for Google Cloud customers. These include many of the world's largest companies, which use Alphabet's servers and software to store and analyze data.\nAlphabet's\u00a0 (GOOG) \u00a0year-over-year revenue growth over the past four quarters is 3%, 7%, 11%, and 13% and its earnings-per-share growth has changed by -11%, 17%, 42%, and 42%.\nThe improving top-and-bottom-line growth rates suggest that Alphabet's business remains on solid ground, with ongoing advertising interest across its platform, including traditional search and YouTube, and increasing investments by Google Cloud customers to train and run their AI initiatives.\nLast quarter, Alphabet's $86.3 billion of revenue outpaced Wall Street estimates by more than $1 billion, while its $1.64 a share of earnings beat forecasts by 4 cents.\nImportantly, revenue at Google's Search & Other business segment increased 12.7% year-over-year to $48 billion and YouTube ads jumped 15.6% to $9.2 billion.\nOf course, anything can happen, but Wedbush Securities analysts say that worry about a structural shift in search away from Google is misplaced.\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalysts revamp C3.ai stock price targets after earnings\nAnalyst updates stock price target for Super Micro Computer\nAnalysts unveil new Nvidia price targets ahead of 'AI Woodstock' conference\u00a0\n\"We acknowledge the near-term uncertainty associated with a broader [Search Generative Experience] rollout but have increasing conviction that over the longer term SGE will provide ample monetization opportunity on par with, or potentially above, traditional Google search,\" Wedbush analysts Scott Devitt, Dan Ives, Michael Gerbino and\u00a0Matthew Weiss recently wrote to institutional investors.\nThe analysts conducted searches on PCs and mobile devices across Alphabet's AI and non-AI tools. They found that AI results with ads generally boasted a similar number of ads to non-AI search results.\nCurrently, those ads are largely above or below the AI-generated results, but over time, Wedbush suspects that Google will increasingly allow ads to be embedded within results, improving their value to advertisers, and opening the door to more revenue opportunities.\nThere's also a big possibility that Alphabet can produce meaningful revenue by licensing its AI to other companies, such as Apple.\nIn March, reports surfaced that Apple was considering a deal to have Google's AI power the AI solutions within future Apple device upgrades. Given the more than two billion active iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple consumer electronics globally, an agreement could be worth big money.\n\"We think Google remains a clear generative AI beneficiary,\" wrote Wedbush. \"Google\u2019s core advertising business is well positioned with growth set to accelerate this year against a strong digital advertising backdrop. Google remains a dominant digital advertising business with healthy underlying growth and significant optionality related to AI across both its advertising and cloud segment.\"\nThe opportunity to overdeliver on AI versus expectations could mean that Google's stock heads higher, especially if investors start valuing the company as they have in the past. Over the past five years, Alphabet's shares have boasted an average price-to-earnings multiple of 22. Currently, it's about 19.\nIf earnings rise thanks to cost-cutting, including layoffs during the bear market and increasing sales, investors could be rewarded with gains. As a result, Wedbush upped its stock price target to $175 from $160, adding Alphabet to its \"best ideas list.\"\n"

        "Text": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.\nWhile each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.\nWhether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.\nApple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.\nBoth Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.\nBut most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.\nI find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.\nSince SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.\nConsidering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "Daniel Ek may have emerged triumphant from his five-year long battle with Apple, but you wouldn\u2019t notice it from the Spotify founder\u2019s grim demeanor.\nOn Monday, the EU Commission\u00a0fined Apple $1.84 billion\u00a0for abusing its dominance in music streaming apps.\nIf the tech giant\u2019s recent anti-competitive behavior was anything to go by, however, Ek believes the world\u2019s second most valuable company has little intention of giving up its walled garden: the iOS ecosystem with its flagship App Store that has minted billions in annual profits.\n\u201cThe internet is at risk,\u201d Ek said in a video statement he posted on Monday, sounding like someone who had lost his case, not won it. \u201cApple has decided that they want to close down the internet and make it theirs.\u201d\nThe Spotify CEO predicted Apple would either ignore the ruling, much like it has in similar cases in Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands, or comply in letter but not in spirit.\nThat's because Apple knows that most of the people accessing the internet are doing so through apps downloaded to smartphones, a revenue opportunity it does not want to pass up. (Apple does not publish data on its share of App Store turnover, just aggregated figures paid to developers.)\n\u201cEven though today may seem like a great win, it might actually just be a very small step in the right direction,\u201d Ek said.\nFortune has contacted Apple for a response to the Spotify chief's comments.\nEk's video message comes after EU Vice President Margrethe Vestager said Apple\u2019s refusal to inform consumers of cheaper options amounted to anti-steering provisions that violated European antitrust law.\n\u201cApple\u2019s conduct, which lasted for almost 10 years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions, because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers,\u201d the Commission\u00a0said.\nApple shot back on Monday by arguing Brussels levied the fine despite a \u201cfailure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm.\u201d\nEk\u2019s company in reality was the true dominant player, according to Apple, controlling over half the European streaming market.\nThis position it enjoys largely thanks to the App Store, Apple said, since its share is higher on iOS than on Android. For that benefit, the Swedish company pays Apple nothing.\nInstead, Spotify lobbied heavily against it, meeting more than 65 times with the Commission during the investigation in the hopes of utilizing Apple\u2019s proprietary tools, technologies and distribution system at no added cost.\n\u201cFree isn\u2019t enough for Spotify,\u201d Apple responded. \u201cThey also want to rewrite the rules of the App Store\u2014in a way that advantages them even more.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Diane Brady, Nicholas Gordon ",
        "Text": "Before Carlos Ghosn gained notoriety for dramatically escaping house arrest in Japan in an audio equipment box, accused by Nissan of underreporting compensation and other serious charges as CEO, he was widely regarded as one of the most innovative leaders in the auto industry. (Here\u2019s an interview Alan Murray did when Ghosn was on top back in 2012, and one I did with Ghosn in 2023 when he was an international fugitive in Lebanon, filing a $1.1 billion lawsuit against Nissan for allegedly damaging his finances and reputation on trumped-up charges.)\nGhosn is still a fugitive in Lebanon, but he's also still credited with rescuing Renault from near bankruptcy and then doing the same at Nissan through a powerful alliance that later included Mitsubishi Motors. What\u2019s less known is how Ghosn also helped launch the EV revolution as a pioneer in developing the electric car. In 2010, when rivals were dipping their toes in the market and Tesla was a money-losing manufacturer trading at $17 a share, Ghosn released the first mass-produced electric vehicle with the Nissan LEAF.\nSo I was curious to ask Ghosn about his views on the current state of the industry and recent news that Apple is\u00a0getting out of the EV business. Unlike Xiaomi founder Lei Jun, who says he was shocked by\u00a0Apple\u2019s decision to pull out of the market, Ghosn says he was not surprised.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they stopped because of technical problems\u2014they have the ability to attract anyone with their resources and brand\u2014but because of value,\u201d says Ghosn. \u201cThese guys are used to high-margin, huge-return businesses, and I don\u2019t think the value proposition was there.\u201d\nGhosn recalls speaking with executives who launched Apple's bid to develop an autonomous electric vehicle in 2014. \u201cI was convinced that they had in mind to do something totally unique,\u201d he says. \u201cI never thought they wanted to be a carmaker but create value around connectivity.\u201d\nThe brand that most impresses him in the EV space right now is China\u2019s BYD, which he thinks is fast gaining on German and U.S. competitors in terms of quality. As for Nissan, which may now partner with Fisker on EVs (and remains Ghosn's nemesis): \u201cWhat a disaster.\u201d\nSuch animosity is no surprise. As Nissan's charges pile up, Ghosn insists that he did nothing wrong. He faces arrest in France and Japan if he leaves Lebanon. While it\u2019s hard to asses the veracity of the charges against Ghosn without a trial, the process by which he was charged and held for more than 100 days in an unheated jail cell does feel, as the UN Human Rights Council put it, \u201carbitrary and unlawful.\u201d\nUnless Ghosn leaves Lebanon to face his day in court, he might never clear his name. Of his lawsuit against Nissan, he says, \u201clittle by little, things are moving along.\u201d A complicated and sad state of affairs for a man could have once retired at the top of his game.\nDiane Brady@dianebradydiane.brady@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Steve Mollman ",
        "Text": "Anyone who\u2019s tried a Xiaomi smartphone knows it\u2019s a worthy competitor to the iPhone. Now the question is, will Xiaomi present the same kind of challenge to Tesla as to Apple?\nOn Thursday, the Chinese juggernaut launched its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan. Billionaire founder and CEO Lei Jun\u2014a household name in China\u2014said at the presentation in Beijing: \"Many people ask me who the Xiaomi SU7 is built for. My answer is, isn't it time for Tesla Model 3 users to upgrade?\"\nThe entrant of yet another deep-pocketed rival in China comes at a difficult time for Elon Musk\u2019s carmaker. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Tesla had reduced EV production at its Shanghai factory amid intense competition and sluggish growth in China. Tesla\u2019s market cap has fallen about 30% this year, spurring the company to scrap Musk\u2019s no-advertising mantra. Tesla also faces competition from China\u2019s Warren Buffett-backed BYD, which dethroned it a few months ago as the world\u2019s top EV seller.\nOf course, Tesla has already proven itself as a leading EV maker, while Xiaomi is new in the space.\n\"In the three years of developing this car, my biggest realization is that making cars is extremely difficult,\u201d Lei said on Thursday. \"Even a giant like Apple gave up on it.\"\nIn February, Lei responded to Apple ending its EV project, saying he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the decision. He's cited Apple cofounder Steve Jobs as a primary inspiration to become an entrepreneur.\nXiaomi, which also makes smart TVs and home appliances, enjoys Apple-like popularity in China.\nLei claimed on Thursday that the SU7, available only in China to start, beats the Tesla Model 3 on 90% of specifications, with Xiaomi needing a few more years to catch up on the rest. He said the sedan had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus 606 for the Model 3. The base model will sell for under $30,000, cheaper than the Model 3 in China.\nLei admitted his company will be losing money on every vehicle it sells for the time being. In December, he said that Xiaomi would spend 10 times the labor and investment carmakers usually commit to a new model. But, he added on Thursday, \"Xiaomi has enough cash reserves to cope with any fierce competition in the next five years.\u201d\nTime will tell if Lei made the right call by entering the competitive EV market or if it should have veered away as Apple did. Plenty of EV startups once valued in the billions are now struggling.\n\"The risk is that they focus too much on the EV space and lose focus on the sectors and products that got them there,\u201d Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, told Reuters.\nBut Xiaomi is off to a strong start, at least, with the company reporting that it had received 120,000 firm orders for the SU7 in 36 hours, meaning this year\u2019s production capacity is sold out.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Steve Jobs is a name synonymous with Apple, the tech giant he co-founded. However, a lesser-known chapter significantly shaped his career and wealth: Pixar Animation Studios. It was Pixar's IPO and the massive success of the movie \"Toy Story\" that made Jobs his first billion, according to reports.\nAfter being ousted from Apple in 1985 because of disagreements with the board of directors, Jobs found himself at a crossroads. This pivotal moment in his life led him to Pixar.\nDon't Miss:\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share.\nUS military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here\u2019s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.\nIn the mid-1990s, while contemplating a return to Apple, Jobs confided in Lawrence Levy, a Pixar colleague, expressing doubts about Apple\u2019s future and his potential role in its revival. During this period, Jobs was at the helm of Pixar, having acquired the computer graphics division from Lucasfilm in 1986, and transformed it into an independent studio. Under his leadership as CEO and major shareholder, Pixar revolutionized animation and secured Jobs\u2019s financial legacy.\nThe turning point came with Pixar\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) in November 1995, coinciding with the release of \u201cToy Story,\u201d the studio\u2019s first feature film. The IPO was a resounding success, catapulting Jobs into the ranks of billionaires. According to Cult Of Mac, he called his friend Google co-founder Larry Page and said \"I made it.\"\nTrending: Fortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\nIt was a defining moment that underscored his ability to lead and innovate beyond the realm of personal computing into the entertainment industry. Lawrence Levy\u2019s memoir, \u201cTo Pixar and Beyond,\u201d chronicles this journey and the strategic decisions that propelled Pixar into a leading animation studio and, eventually, its acquisition by Disney in 2006 for over $7 billion.\nThe success at Pixar restored Jobs\u2019s reputation and gave him the confidence to reassume leadership at Apple. His experiences at Pixar, navigating the intricacies of the entertainment industry alongside Levy, provided lessons that Jobs would later apply to Apple\u2019s operations. The synergy between technology and storytelling that defined Pixar\u2019s ethos became a fundamental aspect of Apple\u2019s product development under Jobs\u2019s leadership.\nJobs\u2019s venture into animation showcases his multifaceted career, marked by innovation, resilience and a relentless pursuit of excellence. His legacy at Pixar is a testament to his vision of blending technology and art for compelling narratives, a philosophy he carried over to Apple.

        "Title": "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Allow Nvidia to Crush Apple and Microsoft, and Become the Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock?",
        "Author": "  Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the hottest player in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most important hardware element of the servers that run advanced AI applications.\nIn the particularly high-margin category of GPUs tailored to run AI and other accelerated computing applications, Nvidia currently commands roughly 90% of the market. While competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are making moves to ramp up their capabilities in the ultra-high-performance GPU space, many analysts expect Nvidia to retain its incredible strength in the category.\nWith incredible performances behind it and management guiding for further explosive growth, Nvidia stock has risen by 240% over the last year and is up 82% so far in 2024.\nThese gains have pushed Nvidia's market cap to roughly $2.27 trillion. It now ranks as the world's third-most valuable company and the third-most valuable member of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Apple, currently sitting in second place, has a market cap of $2.65 trillion, while top dog Microsoft is valued at approximately $3.12 trillion.\nCould Nvidia soon be the world's most valuable company?\nStarting late in 2022, incredible leaps forward in artificial intelligence technologies began to emerge at a rapid pace. That progress ramped up dramatically in 2023, and it has shown no sign of slowing down this year.\nAs businesses and institutions have made moves to gain exposure to the AI space, demand has soared for Nvidia's most advanced processors. Its sales and earnings have shot through the roof.\nIn last year's fourth quarter, the company's sales grew 265% year over year to $22.16 billion. Thanks to dramatic performance acceleration in 2023's second half, Nvidia's annual sales increased by 126% to $60.9 billion.\nNvidia posted $29.76 billion in net income last year -- equal to 49% of its total sales. That's an incredible net income margin for a hardware-oriented business; those often have lower margins compared to software-oriented businesses due to the higher incremental costs associated with producing physical goods.\nBut the company's incredible margins reflect just how highly in demand its GPUs are right now. It's reasonable to expect that Nvidia's incredible growth will moderate, but the business looks poised to grow at a much faster rate than Apple and Microsoft for the next few years at least.\nApple and Microsoft still generate far more revenue and net income than Nvidia. On the other hand, the chip powerhouse looks well positioned to continue being the biggest winner in the AI revolution, and has been growing at a far faster rate than those larger tech giants.\nFor comparison, Microsoft\u00a0 grew its sales roughly by 10% over the trailing-12-month period and increased its net income by 20%. Meanwhile, Apple's revenue was flat across that stretch, though its net income rose by 7%.\nIf demand for AI services continues to rise dramatically, there's a good chance that Nvidia will surpass Apple's market cap and take the title of world's most valuable company from Microsoft within the next five years. While the GPU leader's business has historically been shaped by cyclical trends, it still appears to be in the early stages of benefiting from the unfolding AI revolution.\nRight now, Nvidia is benefiting from the emergence of an unprecedented new technology -- and that means forecasting its performance over the next five years involves a heavy dose of speculation. But given its incredible sales and earnings momentum and the overall market excitement for artificial intelligence applications, it wouldn't be shocking to see Nvidia claim the title of world's most valuable business.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Apple Inc's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-03-04, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.47. It's currently trading at a price of $179.66. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -15.56%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.42\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.2%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n83.3\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n72.17\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n155.47\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $143.19. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -25.47%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  John Csiszar ",
        "Text": "President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have already clinched the presidential nominations of their respective parties, making a rematch in the 2024 election a reality. Regardless of your own political views, as an investor, it\u2019s a good idea to take note of who the next president will be, as it can affect your investments.\nRead Next: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t SellLearn More: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024\nWhile the president doesn\u2019t directly control the stock market, everything from tax changes, trade policies and even casual comments made while on the political trail can affect stock prices. And when big tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft comprise nearly 13% of the market cap of the S&P 500 all on their own, how tech stocks react to the president can have a big effect on the overall market.\nHere\u2019s a look at how tech stocks have done under President Biden and his predecessor, and what the implications might be for Apple, Microsoft and other tech stocks if Biden doesn\u2019t win a second term.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nWhile the Nasdaq-100 index is often used as a proxy for the technology market, that index is also filled with non-tech stocks, such as healthcare and consumer products companies.\nTo compare the performance of tech stocks under the Trump and Biden presidencies, this analysis used the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which is an exchange-traded fund with the symbol XLK. This $65 billion ETF is a true tech index that only includes stocks in technology hardware, storage, and peripherals; software; communications equipment; semiconductors and semiconductor equipment; IT services; and electronic equipment, instruments and components.\nOn the day Trump was inaugurated, Jan. 20, 2017, the XLK closed at 45.92. When Biden took office four years later, on Jan. 20, 2021, the ETF closed at 128.26. That translates to a gain of 179%.\nDiscover More: 8 Best Cryptocurrencies To Invest In for 2024\nIn a nutshell, tech stocks performed much better during Trump\u2019s presidency than Biden\u2019s. Even though Biden still has 10 months left in his presidency, the performance gap of tech stocks between the two presidents is vast.\nSince the XLK closed at 128.26 on the day that Biden took office, it has posted a return of 64.5%, closing at 211.02 on Mar. 13, 2024. This means that the performance of the XLK under Trump was nearly triple what it earned so far under Biden.\nThe S&P 500 index is often used as a proxy for the stock market as a whole, but it\u2019s also heavily weighted towards technology. As of Feb. 20, 2024, the information technology sector comprised 29.4% of the entire S&P 500, more than the next two sectors \u2014 financials and healthcare \u2014 combined. Thus, analyzing the performance of the entire S&P 500 over a president\u2019s term incorporates how both tech stocks and the general market are doing.\nBiden\u2019s first term is not yet complete \u2014 he still has at least 10 months in office \u2014 but as of year-end 2023, the S&P 500 was up 25.9%. This makes it highly unlikely that his four-year performance will match Trump\u2019s, as the S&P 500 returned 67% under the former president.\nWho resides in the White House should just be one of the considerations you factor into your investment analysis when it comes to stocks like Apple and Microsoft. Other factors, like earnings, interest rates, inflation and geopolitical turmoil can all drive stock prices up or down even more than who the president is.\u00a0And let\u2019s not forget \u2014 both presidents have dealt with the ramifications of a pandemic.\nBut there\u2019s no denying that presidential policies can play a role as well. For example, according to Lee Munson, president of Portfolio Wealth Advisors, \u201cBiden has not been friendly to China, but Trump\u2019s going to be even worse \u2026 When you look at Trump, he\u2019s mercurial and could just cut off the tap \u2026 and tell Nvidia they can\u2019t sell anything.\u201d\nChina is important for American tech stocks both due to its demand and its role in the supply chain, so a president\u2019s policy towards China can move markets. However, again, this is just one factor that will affect big tech under the next president.\nWhile Trump might cause more trouble in China, TD Securities analysts note that corporate and personal taxes will likely remain higher under Biden than Trump. This could affect both demand for products and corporate earnings. Of course, this effect might be more than balanced out by falling inflation and interest rates, which may very well become tailwinds for stocks in the second half of 2024 and into 2025.\nThe best course of action is to continue to do your own research and due diligence and look to the long term. Apple and Microsoft will likely far outlast the next four years. If you believe in these specific stocks, tech stocks in general or the market at large, continuing to add to your positions \u2014 especially if they temporarily fall \u2014 is likely the best course of action.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nDownsizing for Retirement?

        "Title": "Better \"Magnificent Seven\" Buy: Nvidia vs. Apple Stock",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are a group of megacap technology companies that have thrived over the past few years and led this new bull market, but it's not been a smooth ride for every member of that group.\nTwo key members, iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), are moving in opposite directions so far in 2024. Apple's stock price has fallen 10% since January, while Nvidia's has risen over 80%.\nSo, which one of these two stocks is the better buy going forward?\n2024 hasn't been kind to the personal electronics giant. The iPhone maker has fallen more than 10% since January. Why? It's most likely due to declining growth expectations. Apple's revenue growth has slowed significantly, which analysts expect will trickle down to slower earnings growth.\nAdditionally, word out of China is that iPhone sales there are slipping. According to research by Counterpoint, iPhone sales were down 24% year over year in China through the first six weeks of the year, as consumers pass on iPhones for Chinese alternatives.\nNow, Apple is still a marvelous company. Investing legend Warren Buffett has called it the best business his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns. Apple makes up over 40% of Berkshire's $363 billion stock portfolio. However, it is understandable that Apple faces questions about its long-term growth. Growing isn't always easy for a massive $2.6 trillion company.\nOn the other hand, Nvidia has been growing shockingly fast. The company is benefiting from a surge of investments related to AI. Nvidia's AI chips are today's dominant market leader, with an estimated 80% market share. That's shown up in fascinating financial results that have seen Nvidia's revenue and profits go parabolic, launching the stock higher in the process.\nThe big question is whether this is a burst or a prolonged trend. Lisa Su, the CEO of Nvidia's competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, believes the AI chip market will grow to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few years. Considering Nvidia's companywide revenue is still \"just\" $61 billion as the market leader, there's a lot of potential upside if this prediction comes true.\nInvestors might be understandably shy toward a stock that has risen so much so fast. However, the fundamentals have (so far) seemingly justified Nvidia's price action. That doesn't mean there aren't risks. For starters, Nvidia does tons of business with relatively few deep-pocketed customers. Losing any of them could put a big dent in revenue. It remains to be seen if AMD and other chip companies can encroach on Nvidia's market share over the coming years.\nChoosing between these two investments depends on whether you believe Apple is more likely to rebound or if Nvidia will run out of steam. Looking at fundamentals, Nvidia has a clear advantage. I like using the PEG ratio to gauge how much I pay for a stock's earnings growth. In other words, how much bang for your buck are you getting?\nComparing the two stocks below reveals a clear winner:\nCompany\nForward P/E Ratio\nExpected Long-Term Average Annual EPS Growth\nPEG Ratio\nApple\n26.0\n9.4%\n2.7\nNvidia\n35.6\n34.8%\n1.0\nData source: Ycharts. EPS = earnings per share.\nLower is better for the PEG ratio. I generally like buying stocks with a PEG ratio of 1.5 or less. As you can see above, Apple is far more expensive than Nvidia for the growth analysts expect over the long term.\nCould Nvidia fall short of analyst estimates? Could Apple outperform its expectations? Of course!\nBut the gap is so vast today that it's hard to justify picking Apple over Nvidia, especially when the company puts up the financials to justify the hype the stock is getting. That makes Nvidia the better Magnificent Seven stock to buy until proven otherwise.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

While iPhone models in the past few years had only incremental upgrades, their Android counterparts have been making technological strides.\nNone of the iPhone models are foldable phones, which are becoming increasingly popular among high-end users in China.\nApple has also been slower than rivals in incorporating generative artificial intelligence functions into smartphones, although CEO Tim Cook told shareholders this week that the company will disclose its AI plans later this year.\nThe iPhone is contending with structural changes in the sector, such as the emergence of a new paradigm in premium mobile phone design, according to a research note in January by Kuo Ming-chi, an analyst at TF International Securities known for his accurate assessment of the Apple supply chain.\nThose transformations will lead to a continuous decline in iPhone shipments in the Chinese market this year, he said.\nApple reported a nearly 13 per cent drop in revenue from Greater China - which includes the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan - in the December quarter.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

In addition to its half a billion in sales, Nothing managed to raise $96 million for U.S. expansion last year.\nFor its third iteration, the Nothing (2a), the group says it is doubling down on the more popular elements of its Nothing (2) while offering a cheaper alternative to its predecessor\u2019s \u00a3499 ($USD) price tag.\nDuring an awkward presentation, in which cofounder Akis Evangelidis stumbled over the pricing of the phone as he tried to market it in three different currencies\u2014U.K. pounds, euros, and Indian rupees\u2014the group unveiled its sleek new smartphone.\nIt should be obvious from its \u00a3319 starting price that Nothing\u2019s modus operandi is simplicity at every stage of the user experience, something that filters through to its design.\nAt the latest launch for the Nothing 2(a) event, designers credited Massimo Vignelli, the creator of a simplified iteration of the New York subway map in the 1970s, as their inspiration for taking complex features of a classic smartphone and breaking them down.\nThe latest phone is built from recycled plastic and metals, offering a less sleek alternative to the Nothing (2)\u2019s glass and metal exterior.\nIts camera sits, unusually, in the middle of the top of the phone, rather than to the side like its older models and traditional smartphones.\nAs with the Nothing Phone (2), the group uses Android\u2019s operating system, Android 14, in its latest model.\nNothing\u2019s CEO Carl Pei has built a reputation as a tech influencer as much as a boss, helping him get on the good side of the traditionally culty tech sector with videos that look like third-party reviews that publicize Nothing\u2019s products.\nLast year, Pei even managed to recruit long-running YouTube superstar Casey Neistat to post an in-depth review of last year\u2019s Nothing 2 that involved Pei and Neistat taking the phone on a literal roller coaster ride.\nHe will be hoping that recognition can help him take on a Steve Jobs\u2013type cult of personality that could pull curious shoppers to the brand.\nIndeed, the group\u2019s choice of India for its launch is likely a sign of its hopes that the cut-price Nothing (2a) model can encroach on Apple\u2019s growing market share in the country.\nThe smartphone will begin at a price of \u00a3319 for its entry-level 128-gigabyte storage model. A pricier model with 265 GB will be available to U.S. buyers for $349 through a sign-up form on Nothing\u2019s website.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Welltory, an all-in-one wellness app, launches a new AI/ML-driven Today Screen feature that combines Apple Watch data with science to help users see how everything they do impacts their bodies and reduce the harm of sedentary stress \u2014 one of the leading health risks estimated to cost up to $54 billion in direct health care globally.\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As wearables and apps collect users' health data, the potential for actionable insights has largely remained untapped. Welltory bridges this gap, combining science with proprietary technology to transform Apple Watch data into personalized guidance that goes beyond steps, calories, or heart rate. The app's new Today Screen lets users see the toll of sedentary stress on their bodies, shows them where it's coming from, and teaches them how to reduce its harm in real time.Results from the new feature's limited beta test show that the app's users who see the new Today Screen are twice as likely to come back the next week. Day 7 retention rates have grown by 163% for free users and by 74% for customers.\nJane Smorodnikova, Welltory's CEO and co-founder, said: \"Our approach to personal data interpretation focuses on the total impact of all your actions on your body and wellbeing. Because really, what does it mean that I burned 500 calories or walked 10,000 steps? Well, it depends on lots of things \u2014 your age, fitness level, but especially how much time you spent sitting in stressful meetings or in front of your computer that day. Personalization and an integrated understanding of your data are crucial, and people intuitively know this \u2014 that's why our beta test shows that users are way more likely to come back if they see our Today Screen.\"\nToday Screen packs the day's heart rate data into a Pressure gauge that reflects the toll of sedentary stress on the cardiovascular system \u2014 the Pressure gauge grows when users sit in place under stress, but users can bring the gauge back down with physical activity. This kind of interpretation is driven by Welltory's 71 proprietary algorithms that ensure the science behind Welltory adapts to and serves each individual personally. Heart rate zones are adjusted daily based on a user's resting heart rate, heart rate reserve, and population norms. The adjusted results are then used to make sense of the day's heart rate data and differentiate sedentary stress from rest, exercise, neutral movement.\nThe new Today Screen has also repackaged Welltory's signature heart rate variability analysis \u2014 the product's scientific core backed by research Welltory has published in MDPI and IEEE. Today's Wellness category reflects day-to-day changes in wellbeing based on heart rate variability, letting users see how their numbers compare to their own personal baselines along with population norms for their age and gender.\nAbout Welltory:\nWelltory is the tech company behind an all-in-one wellness application ranked in the top 50 Health & Fitness Top Grossing and featured 20 times by the App Store.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia stock rose 239% on the back of incredible demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia is now worth more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.\u00a0Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) are also members of the $1 trillion club, and each company is working on AI in its own unique way.\nBut I think AI could soon propel Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to a $1 trillion valuation, too. It operates industry-leading AI data center infrastructure, and the company is building capacity at a record pace because it simply can't keep up with demand. As of this writing, Oracle is valued at $350 billion, so investors who buy the stock today will see roughly a 185% gain if the company joins the $1 trillion club.\nFounded in 1977, Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. It developed revolutionary database management software back then, before helping its business customers prepare for the internet age in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The company created Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 and has since delivered hundreds of digital services to those businesses to migrate their operations online.\nNow, using Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs), Oracle is focused on delivering the best data center infrastructure for AI workloads. Three months ago, Oracle told investors it was expanding 66 of its existing data center regions and building 100 more to meet demand.\nChairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology allows businesses to develop generative AI models twice as fast and for half the cost of other cloud providers. As a result, demand for its latest Gen2 Cloud capacity is skyrocketing. Oracle is able to keep costs down because its data centers rely on automation, which means there is little difference in operating costs between running 10 data centers and running 100. That also enables the company to build and scale them quickly.\nIn a conference call with investors for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), CEO Safra Catz said Oracle has at least 40 new AI bookings worth more than $1 billion each that haven't even come online yet.\u00a0In other words, they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during Q3, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%. While that sounds like a sluggish growth rate, revenue for OCI surged 49% to $1.8 billion, and revenue for Gen2 Cloud specifically (within OCI) grew by 53%.\nWhile OCI only accounts for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue right now, those growth rates will ensure it becomes a much larger piece of the pie in the near future.\nOracle's total AI bookings across its business topped a record $80 billion in Q3, marking a 29% increase from the year-ago period. As you can see, bookings grew four times faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which is evidence of the enormous demand for computing capacity the company is struggling to fill.\nAt the bottom line, Oracle's Q3 earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85, which also outpaced revenue growth. It was thanks, in part, to careful cost management, with operating expenses increasing just 4% year over year. But it was also thanks to a substantial increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side, which is a natural consequence of scale. Oracle expects continued improvement as more of its new data centers come online.\nAI is the main point of focus for Oracle at the moment, but there's another opportunity worth mentioning. The company now has two Oracle Alloy data center regions online, which organizations can use to deliver their own cloud services to their customers -- without having to manage the infrastructure.\nOracle has planned five more Alloy data center regions, meaning capacity could soon triple. It's just another example of this company's long-standing commitment to innovation.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is on track to generate $53.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending May 31), placing its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6. That falls between the valuations of other cloud giants, like Amazon (P/S ratio of 3.1) and Microsoft (P/S ratio of 13.2).\nAssuming Oracle's P/S ratio remains constant, the company would have to generate $151.5 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could get there within a decade if its revenue grows by 11% annually.\nWhile Oracle is growing more slowly on a quarterly basis right now, its revenue increased by 22% last fiscal year. Plus, Ellison believes OCI revenue will increase by more than 50% for years to come, which could drive an acceleration in the company's top line overall as the segment grows larger.\nRemember, Oracle is in the process of more than doubling its data center footprint, and its bookings just soared by 29% in a single quarter. Bookings are expected to convert into revenue eventually, implying revenue growth will likely accelerate in the near future.\nAI is the greatest financial opportunity Oracle has ever pursued, and I think it's the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Bloomberg News ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. sustained its run of strong quarterly profit growth, building on the resurgence of its consumer business against Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone and the rise of its cloud division against incumbent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTexas Toll Road Takeover to Cost Taxpayers at Least $1.7 Billion\nApple Explores Home Robotics as Potential \u2018Next Big Thing\u2019 After Car Fizzles\nKim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War Scenarios\nStocks Hit by Fedspeak and Oil in Run-Up to Jobs: Markets Wrap\nSaudi Crown Prince MBS\u2019s $100 Billion Foreign Investment Quest Falters\nThe Chinese networking and electronics leader reported net profit of about 13.9 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in the December quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations from its financial figures. That\u2019s more than 65% higher than the 8.4 billion yuan tally a year earlier.\nThe results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. In August, the company unveiled its flagship Mate 60 smartphone lineup with a domestically designed and produced 7-nanometer processor, setting off a wave of nationalistic popularity at home. Its consumer electronics division surged by 17.3% in 2023, to bring in sales of 251.5 billion yuan.\nHuawei, which was almost knocked out of smartphones and chipmaking after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is emerging as a symbol of China\u2019s determination to thwart Washington\u2019s curbs. It\u2019s now building a network of chipmaking plants to underpin its longer-term ambitions in arenas such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.\nThe company\u2019s cloud computing arm grew by nearly 22% during the year, as it made further inroads in competing with Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home. This month, the firm deployed an artificial intelligence-powered weather forecasting model with the meteorological bureau of Shenzhen, its home city. The company\u2019s chips are also showing up in the systems of Chinese AI developers, such as the one used by the Hong Kong-based Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to train an AI assistant for neurosurgeons.\nWhile Huawei hasn\u2019t gone as far as Xiaomi Corp., which this week launched its first own-brand EVs, the Shenzhen company\u2019s making progress in providing technology for the automotive sector. That business grew by 128% in 2023, and Huawei has been showing off Aito vehicles in its stores in China.\nHuawei\u2019s resurgence coincides with growing pressure on Apple from the Chinese government, which is increasingly mandating or encouraging the use of homegrown devices and technology across different industries and sectors \u2014 including state enterprises. The rise of the Mate 60 has also fired up consumer enthusiasm for local brands.\nIPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, according to official data, extending a slump in demand for the flagship device in its most important overseas market.\nBut Huawei in December warned of the dangers a volatile industry and global economy will pose in 2024. In the wake of its 7nm breakthrough, officials in Washington are weighing a variety of responses from blacklisting Huawei suppliers to roping in allies to tighten an existing blockade of semiconductor technology.\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said the US will \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to protect its national security.\nRead More: Apple China Slowdown Sparks Fears That Prized Market Is at Risk\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Hertz\u2019s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways\nElon Musk\u2019s X Has a Porn Problem\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit\u2014With an Uncertain Future\nFixing Boeing\u2019s Broken Culture Starts With a New Plane\nCanada\u2019s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "While the president of the United States has no official control over how the stock market performs, there\u2019s no denying that the policies a president endorses can affect stock prices. Trade policies, tax changes and even passing comments made in speeches for political gain can get investors nervous about certain sectors.\nFind Out: Warren Buffett Sold His Apple Stock \u2013 Here\u2019s Why  Check Out: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nOver the long run, earnings do drive stock prices, but over the short term \u2014 such as the four- or eight-year run of a particular president \u2014 certain industries can and do outperform others. This is why regardless of your political preference, it\u2019s important as an investor to understand who is in office and what that person stands for.\nHow big tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft are affected is particularly important, as they alone comprise nearly 13% of the entire market value of the S&P 500 index.\nHere\u2019s a look at how tech stocks have done under President Joe Biden and what the implications might be for Apple, Microsoft and other tech stocks if he wins a second term.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nFor purposes of this analysis, \u201ctech stocks\u201d are represented by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, an ETF with the trading symbol XLK. This $67 billion ETF tracks only tech stocks, including those in the following industries: technology hardware, storage and peripherals; software; communications equipment; semiconductors and semiconductor equipment; IT services; and electronic equipment, instruments and components.\nThis differentiates it from the Nasdaq 100 index, which while often used as a proxy for \u201ctechnology stocks\u201d actually includes a large number of non-tech stocks.\nThe XLK closed at $128.26 on Jan. 20, 2021, the day Biden was inaugurated. With a close of $211.02 on March 13, 2024, that tech index has posted a profitable return of 64.5% since Biden took office.\nDiscover More: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nThe XLK closed at a price of $45.92 on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Donald Trump was inaugurated. On the day he handed over the reins to President Biden, Jan. 20, 2021, the index sat at $128.26. That amounts to a gain of 179%, which nearly triples the performance of the XLK during Biden\u2019s tenure.\nBiden still has 10 months left in his presidency, but the performance difference is so great that it\u2019s unlikely Biden can make it all up in less than one year.\nIt\u2019s important to note that while presidents certainly can have an effect on the stock market, they are just one of many influences. Earnings, interest rates, inflation, geopolitical turmoil and many other factors can impact the market even more than what a president says or does.\nWhile Republicans traditionally have the reputation as being more \u201cbusiness friendly,\u201d some analysts think Trump might actually be more of a drag when it comes to tech in 2024. This is because China is so important to technology stocks, and Trump has a passionate anti-China policy when it comes to significant policies like tariffs.\nAs Portfolio Wealth Advisors president Lee Munson told Yahoo Finance Live, \u201cBiden has not been friendly to China, but Trump\u2019s going to be even worse.\u201d\nTaking the analysis one step further, Munson noted, \u201cWhen you look at Trump, he\u2019s mercurial and could just cut off the tap \u2026 and tell Nvidia they can\u2019t sell anything.\u201d\nIn other words, tech companies have at least an understanding of what they need to do to perform under a Biden presidency; but, if he were to lose, policies under Trump might be more unpredictable.\nAs to which direction tech stocks might take under a second Biden term, there are mixed signals. Analysts at TD Securities note that Biden is more likely to keep taxes higher than Trump, which could hinder corporate profits.\nCountering that, however, is the fact that interest rates are likely to fall in late 2024 and into 2025, as the Fed has already announced that it intends to cut rates at least three times. Combined with falling inflation, those could both be tailwinds for stocks, especially rate-sensitive tech stocks.\nWith all of these conflicting factors, perhaps it\u2019s best to simply follow the advice of famed billionaire Warren Buffett, the \u201cOracle of Omaha.\u201d\nIn his 2016 address to his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett said, \u201cIn my lifetime, GDP per capita in real terms has gone up six for one. \u2026 I\u2019m confident that 20 years from now there will be far more output per capita than there is now.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) stock has rallied by about 180% over the past 12 months and now trades just a few dollars shy of its all-time high. Investors rushed back to the social media giant as its advertising business recovered, and as management expanded its share buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a dividend.\nThat rally lifted Meta's market cap past the trillion-dollar mark for the first time in two years this January, and it's now worth $1.2 trillion. However, Meta is still less valuable than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has throttled the company's ad sales over the past three years by improving the user-privacy aspects of the iOS mobile operating system.\nBut now that Meta's business is firing on all cylinders again, could it overtake Apple -- which currently has a market cap of $2.8 trillion -- by 2030?\nMeta's growth stalled out in 2022 as it struggled with fierce competition from ByteDance's TikTok, macro headwinds for the advertising market, and the impact of Apple's user-privacy upgrades. Its Reality Labs unit, which houses its metaverse efforts and its virtual and augmented reality devices, also continued to lose billions of dollars every quarter. During that challenging year, Meta's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) declined by 1% and 38%, respectively.\nBut in 2023, Meta's revenue and EPS rose 16% and 73%, respectively, as its advertising business recovered. It countered Apple's iOS changes by gathering more first-party data with its own AI algorithms, challenged TikTok by expanding its Reels short video platform on Facebook and Instagram, and offset its declining ad prices by selling more ad impressions. It also attracted a lot of new ad purchases from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies, which were trying to reach more overseas customers; China-based advertisers drove 5 percentage points of its total revenue growth during the year.\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings to grow at a compound annual rate of 14% and 22%, respectively. Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those estimates at 24 times forward earnings.\nIf Meta matches those estimates and continues to grow its bottom line at a compound annual rate of 15% from 2026 to 2030, its EPS could rise to $46.70. If its forward multiple remains roughly the same, in early 2030, its stock could be trading at about $1,120, giving it a market cap of nearly $2.8 trillion. That would match Apple's current valuation.\nApple also suffered a slowdown over the past three years. In its fiscal 2022 (which ended Sept. 24, 2022), its revenue and EPS only rose 8% and 9%, respectively, as it lapped a period of robust sales of its first 5G handset, the iPhone 12. In fiscal 2023, Apple's revenue fell 3% and its earnings stayed nearly flat as the 5G upgrade cycle ended and its sales of Macs withered in a post-pandemic market. China's economic slowdown and tough currency headwinds exacerbated that pressure.\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to grow at a compound annual rate of 4% and 8%, respectively. Those growth rates look stable, but they're not that impressive for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings.\nApple still trades at a premium to its growth because it's widely considered a safe-haven stock. The company can still diversify its portfolio away from the iPhone over the next few years with fresh products and subscription services, and it could expand through acquisitions and investments by tapping its $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. However, its price-to-earnings ratio could gradually contract if it doesn't reaccelerate its growth.\nIf Apple meets analysts' expectations and grows its EPS at a modest compound annual rate of 8% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, its EPS could reach $10.50. If its valuation remained at 28 times forward earnings at that point, its stock would be trading at $294, giving it a market cap of $4.5 trillion. But if Apple's forward multiple dropped to 20 -- in line with other mature tech companies -- its stock price of $210 per share would give it a market cap of $3.2 trillion.\nBased on those calculations and forecasts, Meta probably won't be worth more than Apple by 2030, but it could have a lot more upside potential than the iPhone maker. For Meta to reach Apple's current market cap by 2030, its stock would have to more than double from its current levels.\nMeanwhile, Apple could struggle to match those gains if it continues to generate single-digit percentage earnings growth while trading at premium valuations. That outlook might change if the Vision Pro takes off or if Apple launches other revolutionary products or services -- but it will take a lot of work to diversify the business away from its dependence on the iPhone.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

The 33% surge in profit was the strongest year-on-year growth logged for a quarter since March 2021.\nIn addition to robust demand for AI servers, it also had better-than-expected sales of cloud and networking products and smart consumer electronics.\nApple last month reported sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, powered by growth in its iPhone business though its China sales missed analysts' estimates.\nIn the fourth quarter, consumer electronics including smartphones accounted for 58% of Foxconn's revenue while cloud and networking products which include servers contributed 20%.\nAlthough it expects healthy growth over 2024, Foxconn cautioned that first-quarter revenue was set to come in lower than the same period a year ago when sales surged after pandemic restrictions were lifted in China.\nChief Financial Officer David Huang also said that 2024 growth in capital expenditure would at least match last year's rate, partly due to the company's drive to diversify investment around the world and expand into areas such as electric vehicles and semiconductors.\nFoxconn's capital expenditure climbed 14% in 2023 to around T$111.7 billion ($3.6 billion).\n($1 = 31.5090 Taiwan dollars)\n(Reporting by Yimou Lee and Faith Hung; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree, Christopher Cushing and Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 22, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights The Apple AAPL and New York Community Bank NYCB.\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Apple stands out as one of the great American companies due to its relentless innovation, iconic design, and unwavering brand loyalty. Apple has consistently set industry standards and reshaped technology landscapes from groundbreaking products like the iPhone to its sleekly designed laptops. Its financial success, with a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, underscores its influence and prowess in global markets.\nToday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it sued Apple in an antitrust case over its landmark iPhone product. The DOJ alleges that Apple has a monopoly over the phone market that has harmed consumers, developers, and rival companies. Though I am normally a \u201cfree market\u201d person, I believe the DOJ has a good case. Apple can indiscriminately ban apps on its Appstore, and with its overwhelming stranglehold on the smartphone market, it can kill businesses and innovation.\nWeakness tends to beget weakness in the stock market. For example, while the S&P 500 Index was putting in an intermediate bottom in October 2023, New York Community Bank was underperforming \u2013 a subtle clue of the damage to come.\nCurrently, AAPL shares have been stuck in the mud for months and are flashing the same kind of clue.\nAAPL shares are breaking down out of a daily bear flag pattern on heavy volume \u2013 a bearish sign.\nApple became a powerhouse stock due to its innovation and growth. However, without iconic CEO Steve Jobs at the helm, innovation has come to a standstill. The company killed its multi-year attempt to build an electric car, is behind in the AI race, and has been unimpressive in delivering the \u201cwow\u201d factor in new iPhone releases.\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s 13F disclosure saw Buffett decreasing his massive AAPL position for the first time in years. Furthermore, AAPL was only mentioned once in Berkshire\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, a hint that Buffett may be selling more stock soon.\nFlat iPhone revenue, regulatory scrutiny, and a lack of innovation are convincing reasons to avoid AAPL and look elsewhere in the market for growth.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA and Celsius Holdings CELH.\nEarnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple, NVIDIA and Celsius Holdings.\nLet's take a closer look at each.\nApple\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\nStill, EPS wasn't the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\nIt's worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises.\nShares couldn't hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin.\nNVIDIA \nNVIDIA's quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA's Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity.\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nCelsius Holdings\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year.\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong growth.\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including those above, have posted quarterly records.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "Steve Jobs was a 21-year-old college dropout when he founded Apple. 20-year-old Bill Gates launched Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg was 19 when he first came up with the idea of Facebook. Their present-day equivalents\u2014today's Gen Z entrepreneurs\u2014want the same opportunity to innovate, but keep coming up against stereotypes they can't avoid.\nOf course, the legacies built by the aforementioned trio didn't come without decades of hard work. But had these young hopefuls not gained the respect\u2014and financial backing\u2014of their older peers early on, society might never have known the iPhone, Excel or the 'like' button.\nTwenty years later and for the first time, Gen Z founders have reached the age\u2014at the upper end of the 11-to-27-year-old spectrum\u2014where they have the experience and ability to launch the first wave of disruptors for their own generation.\nYet in a post-pandemic world, the workforce is facing inter-generational friction. Just ask actress Jodie Foster, who said younger peers can be \"annoying\" to work with or the managers who say they're \"difficult.\"\nSo it's perhaps no wonder that the GenZ bosses Fortune spoke to said they have received something of a mixed reaction to their own forays into entrepreneurship.\nThe phenomenon of being dunked on by older generations isn't new\u2014ask the millennials accused of missing out on affordable housing because they spent all their spare cash on avocados and oat milk lattes.\nBut while Gen Z can wait for time to dispel the notion that they're social media-obsessed and work-shy, investors may already have missed out on the next big thing.\nWhen Nicole Rechtszaid sits down with prospective clients for her L.A.-based social commerce company it's a \"coin toss\" as to whether they'll believe she has the experience she claims to.\nThe founder of Ghost Agency already has a raft of major clients under her belt, having worked with TikTok for a number of years before taking on the likes of Alo Yoga, G Fuel Energy and a wide range of content creators.\nRechtszaid's CV is unusual\u2014after all, she has more than a decade's worth of experience working with streaming platforms since landing her first salaried contracts on Twitch at the age of 14.\nBut even with her wealth of knowledge, her meetings are often sprinkled with a dose of distrust.\nShe explained: \"About half the time a prospective client will say to me: \u2018But you look so young? I don\u2019t believe that you actually did all this.\u2019 Or \u2018You look like a child, are you sure?\u2019 They think it\u2019s funny.\"\n\"I try and make a joke out of it because I don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable,\" the 24-year-old told Fortune. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s usually done with malintent but they definitely are saying to themselves: \u2018This person is less professional or less experienced than competitors that I\u2019m meeting with.\u2019\"\nBeing a Gen Z boss at the moment is out of the ordinary: less than 10% of the entire U.S. workforce fell into this demographic in 2020 according to Purdue Global, but this figure is expected to rise to around 30% by 2030.\nIn cases where Nicole and her 37-year-old co-founder Jenny Woo need to \"convince\" partners of their abilities, they've realized it simply isn't worth it: \"There are going to be companies that get it, and companies that absolutely do not understand.\"\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, Meagan Loyst has unique insight into the brightest minds of her generation courtesy of her organization, GenZ VCs, and its 28,000 members.\nLoyst, a New Yorker currently studying at the University of Oxford, created the platform three years ago to bring together like-minded individuals wanting to gain advice on investing, as well as entrepreneurs looking to expand their networks.\nThe CEO born in 1997 said the marketplace's preoccupation with millennial-era college hotshot founders is now giving way to investors more concerned with derisking.\n\"This notion of funding young, smart founders coming out of elite universities has been perpetuated for a long time,\" Loyst said, citing Mark Zuckerberg and Snap's Evan Spiegel.\nYet in the current macroeconomic environment, Loyst echoed Rechtszaid's belief that youth is no longer seen as a guarantee for innovation\u2014it's a red flag.\n\"This is not everyone but investors are going back to repeat founders, those who have already seen success, because it helps derisk,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s negatively impacting young founders who have less experience: the onus falls on them to establish their credibility early and be able to articulate that in a very serious way.\n\"If you\u2019re already seeing investors pulling back\u2026 and you know that the odds are stacked against you, you have to go above and beyond.\"\nAnother dynamic between Gen Z bosses and their inter-generational teams is at play: social media.\nGen Z is a group who have never known a world without Facebook, born in the era of the baby influencer with everything from their day of birth to their high school graduation snapped online.\nThough battling loneliness and isolation, they're a generation accustomed to being highly visible, with Loyst saying this can work \"for you, towards you or against you.\"\nAn influencer herself, she echoed Rechtszaid: \"People can come to a conversation with preconceived notions around what you know vs what you don\u2019t.\"\nAt Ghost Agency, Rechtszaid said the sunnier side to the age debate is that some clients acknowledge her company simply knows more about the subject.\nWhether it's because she's got more experience with the platform, understands the demographic her client is trying to reach, or has a team built to achieve these aims, Rechtszaid wants to make sure the reasons her clients trust her are exemplified in the make-up of her team.\nWith six full-time staff expected to be on the books by the end of spring, Rechtszaid said her hiring technique was centered around individual growth.\n\"Determination, motivation and really an understanding of the space is all that we care about,\" when looking for staff, she said. \"At that point, we feel people can be trained and molded into understanding how to take on a manager role or a director role.\n\"It\u2019s not that challenging to understand how to shift from something you\u2019ve done before to learning how to communicate it with other people, as long as you have the desire.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"
