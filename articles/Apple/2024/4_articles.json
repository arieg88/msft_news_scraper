        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) 2024 has been rough so far. But despite the company\u2019s headwinds ranging from antitrust suits to slowing iPhone sales, there\u2019s one big bright spot for Apple: its Services business. In the first quarter, Services revenue jumped 11% year over year to $6.3 billion.\nAnd according to BofA Global Research\u2019s Wamsi Mohan, Apple is set to report another quarter of double-digit growth for the segment when it announces its second-quarter earnings later this month.\nApple\u2019s Services business includes the company\u2019s App Store sales, advertising revenue, AppleCare+, subscription services like Apple TV+, and more. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, App Store revenue grew 11% in the first quarter of the year, up from 3% in the first quarter of 2023 and 5% in Q1 2022.\nApple\u2019s App Store also appears to be surviving the EU\u2019s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) without much issue. The legislation, which went into effect in March, forces both Apple and Google to allow consumers to download and install third-party app stores and notify users that they can switch to third-party web browsers.\nSensor Tower data indicates that while App Store in-app spending grew 13% globally in March, it increased 28% in the EU.\n\u201cAlthough the DMA has been in effect for roughly one month, it appears there has been no significant impact to Apple\u2019s revenue from in-app purchases (or subscriptions),\u201d the firm stated.\nAccording to Reuters, EU-based user numbers for third-party browsers like Aloha increased 250% in March.\nBut with more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices in circulation, the company isn\u2019t likely to face much of an impact from third-party browser installs. In fact, according to Mohan, App Store installs in the EU have increased 2% year over year since the DMA went into effect, while revenue rose 24%.\nThat said, Apple also requires app developers that offer apps via third-party app stores to pay a 50-euro cent \"core technology\" fee for each app users install after the first million installs. Apple says the fee is necessary to maintain app security and upkeep, but the European Union's antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, is looking into whether Apple is violating the terms of the DMA.\nFor now, however, Apple\u2019s Services business continues to perform well at a time when the company\u2019s other segments are facing declining revenue. In Q1, Apple reported an 11% drop in its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, while its iPad business revenue plummeted 25% in the quarter.\nAnd while iPhone sales increased 6% year over year in Q1, they declined 13% in China, Apple\u2019s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. Part of that problem has to do with China\u2019s tepid economic environment, but the company is also contending with a resurgent Huawei as well as other home-grown smartphone makers stealing away market share.\nApple\u2019s iPad business is also facing difficulties, with revenue declining 3% in 2023 and 8% in 2022.\nOn the legal front, the Department of Justice is suing Apple for allegedly stymying competition in the smartphone space. The European Union has also fined the company $2 billion over antitrust concerns related to music streaming services.\nWe\u2019ll find out more about Apple\u2019s performance in the quarter when it reports its fiscal Q2 results May 2.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. announces its latest financial results post-market Thursday amid various headwinds, including missed growth expectations, increased competition and increasing perceptions that it is not as innovative as it once was.\nAPPL stock rose 3% on Monday amid investor hopes that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company would build on the same artificial intelligence momentum that has recently swept Microsoft and other tech firms upward. But AAPL\u00a0is down nearly 12% for the year.\nThis poor performance has been a drag on many tech-focused exchange-traded funds this year. For example, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) started the week up a modest 4.4% year-to-date, which lagged the 7.3% gain on the SPDR S&P ETF Trust (SPY).\nApple, Inc. (AAPL) stock is down in 2024 for many reasons. Here's a breakdown of some potential factors that some analysts say are contributing to the stock price decline:\nMissed growth expectations: While Apple maintains a massive installed user base, its product sales, particularly iPhones, were down 19% in the first three months of 2024. This has led to investor disappointment and a decline in stock price.\nCompetition: Renewed competition from Huawei, particularly in the Chinese market, is putting pressure on Apple's smartphone dominance. Huawei's resurgence with its advanced 5G technology disrupts Apple's market share, especially in a critical country like China.\nInnovation shortfall: Apple is battling a rising perception among investors that Apple hasn't delivered groundbreaking innovations recently. Compared to previous years with product launches like the Apple Watch or AirPods, there\u00a0is a lack of excitement surrounding newer offerings, leading to a less bullish outlook.\nTech sector slowdown: The technology sector hasn't performed as well as some other sectors in 2024. This broader slowdown might be affecting AAPL stock along with other tech giants.\nValuation concerns: Apple's stock price might have reached a point where some investors believe it's overvalued compared to its current growth prospects. The AAPL price-earnings ratio is approximately 26, which is not extreme, but is slightly above the 20-25 average range for growth stocks.\nTicker\nFund\nExpense Ratio\nAUM\nAAPL Allocation\nVGT\nVanguard Information Technology ETF\n0.10%\n$62.6B\n21.5%\nXLK\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund\n0.09%\n$61.9B\n19.9%\nFTEC\nFidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF\n0.08%\n$9.2B\n19.6%\nIXN\niShares Global Tech ETF\n0.41%\n$4.2B\n18.1%\nIYW\niShares U.S. Technology ETF\n0.40%\n$15.7B\n15.2%\nData as of April 25, 2024. Leveraged ETFs were excluded from this list. See the full list of ETFs holding AAPL stock.\nAnalysts' forecasts for AAPL stock in 2024 are mixed, but generally lean toward moderate growth, as Apple remains a valuable company with a strong brand and loyal customer base. Here's a breakdown of what analysts are saying:\nAverage price target: As of April 29, 2024, analyst consensus suggests an average price target for AAPL in the range of $200 to $207 per share, according to TipRanks. This represents a potential upside of roughly 15-20% from its most recent price of about $174.\nVaried opinions: While the average price target indicates potential growth, individual analyst forecasts can vary significantly. Some analysts might be more bullish, predicting higher price points, while others might be more cautious with lower targets.\nFocus on revenue and earnings: Analyst forecasts often consider factors like projected revenue, earnings per share (EPS), and overall company performance. Apple's recent sales figures, particularly in China, might be leading some analysts to revise their forecasts downward.\nWhile Apple's stock is down year-to-date in 2024, it's important to consider its long-term performance and remember that the overall stock market can be volatile in the short term as economic conditions fluctuate.\nIt's always wise to conduct your own research and consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before making investment decisions.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Text": "Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are down 13% year to date. The company is facing several headwinds right now, including weak iPhone sales in China and increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe.\nDespite these headwinds, Wells Fargo has an overweight (buy) rating on the shares with a $225 price target. That's 35% higher than Apple's current share price of $166.90.\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30, 2023), iPhone sales grew in every region except China. But analysts expect Apple to report a 5% year-over-year decline in revenue for the fiscal second quarter.\nApple is expected to launch generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for iOS later this year, which could stimulate iPhone demand, but investors are worried about the cost of these new features. Analysts expect Apple to post earnings per share of $1.50 for fiscal Q2, slightly down from $1.52 in the year-ago period.\nAnother cloud hanging over Apple stock right now is regulation. In March, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit alleging that Apple is monopolizing the smartphone market with certain contractual restrictions placed on app developers. Meanwhile, the European Union is trying to force Apple to offer users alternative ways to buy content in the App Store.\nOverall, these headwinds may continue to negatively impact investor sentiment around the stock in the near term, but these issues don't impact the value of Apple's brand.\nThe stock's valuation still isn't cheap on a price-to-earnings basis, and with Apple likely facing another quarter of soft iPhone sales, investors shouldn't expect the stock to reach the analyst's price target anytime soon. However, stronger iPhone sales in calendar 2025, especially if Apple releases new AI features, may be the catalyst that sends the share price higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., aiming to boost sluggish computer sales, is preparing to overhaul its entire Mac line with a new family of in-house processors designed to highlight artificial intelligence.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nChina Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel\nBeyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROI\nTreasury Yields Hit 2024 Highs as Powell in Focus: Markets Wrap\nIMF Steps Up Its Warning to US Over Spending and Ballooning Debt\nIran\u2019s Conflict With Israel Puts US Ally Jordan on Edge\nThe company, which released its first Macs with M3 chips five months ago, is already nearing production of the next generation \u2014 the M4 processor \u2014 according to people with knowledge of the matter. The new chip will come in at least three main varieties, and Apple is looking to update every Mac model with it, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven\u2019t been announced.\nThe new Macs are underway at a critical time. After peaking in 2022, Mac sales fell 27% in the last fiscal year, which ended in September. In the holiday period, revenue from the computer line was flat. Apple attempted to breathe new life into the Mac business with an M3-focused launch event last October, but those chips didn\u2019t bring major performance improvements over the M2 from the prior year.\nApple also is playing catch-up in AI, where it\u2019s seen as a laggard to Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and other tech peers. The new chips are part of a broader push to weave AI capabilities into all its products.\nApple is aiming to release the updated computers beginning late this year and extending into early next year. There will be new iMacs, a low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, and Mac minis \u2014 all with M4 chips. But the company\u2019s plans could change. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\nApple shares climbed 4.3% to $175.04 on Thursday in New York, the biggest single-day gain in 11 months. They had been down 13% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close.\nThe move will mark a quick refresh schedule for the iMac and MacBook Pro, as both lines were just updated in October. The Mac mini was last upgraded in January 2023.\nApple is then planning to follow up with more M4 Macs throughout 2025. That includes updates to the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air by the spring, the Mac Studio around the middle of the year, and the Mac Pro later in 2025. The MacBook Air received the M3 chip last month, while the Mac Studio and Mac Pro were updated with M2 processors last year.\nThe M4 chip line includes an entry-level version dubbed Donan, more powerful models named Brava and a top-end processor codenamed Hidra. The company is planning to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the components and how they\u2019ll integrate with the next version of macOS, which will be announced in June at Apple\u2019s annual developer conference.\nRead More: Apple Set to Unveil AI Strategy at June 10 Developers Conference\nThe Donan chip is coming to the entry-level MacBook Pro, the new MacBook Airs and a low-end version of the Mac mini, while the Brava chips will run the high-end MacBook Pros and a pricier version of the Mac mini. For the Mac Studio, Apple is testing versions with both a still-unreleased M3-era chip and a variation of the M4 Brava processor.\nThe highest-end Apple desktop, the Mac Pro, is set to get the new Hidra chip. The Mac Pro remains the lower-selling model in the company\u2019s computer lineup, but it has a vocal fan base. After some customers complained about the specifications of Apple\u2019s in-house chips, the company is looking to beef up that machine next year.\nAs part of the upgrades, Apple is considering allowing its highest-end Mac desktops to support as much as a half-terabyte of memory. The current Mac Studio and Mac Pro top out at 192 gigabytes \u2014 far less capacity than on Apple\u2019s previous Mac Pro, which used an Intel Corp. processor. The earlier machine worked with off-the-shelf memory that could be added later and handle as much as 1.5 terabytes. With Apple\u2019s in-house chips, the memory is more deeply integrated into the main processor, making it harder to add more.\nThe big focus for Apple this year is to add new artificial intelligence features across its products. The company is planning to preview a slew of new features at its June developer conference. A large swath of those features are designed to run on the devices themselves \u2014 rather than in remote servers \u2014 and speedier chips will help drive those enhancements. Apple is also planning to make AI-focused upgrades to this year\u2019s iPhone processor.\nThe company\u2019s switch to in-house chips was part of a long-running initiative known as Apple Silicon. The tech giant started using its own semiconductors in the original iPad and iPhone 4 in 2010, before bringing the technology to the Mac in 2020. The goal has been to better unify its hardware and software with underlying components and move away from processors made by Intel.\nSo far, the effort has been a success, helping boost performance and ease the redesign of devices such as the latest MacBook Air, iMac and MacBook Pro. Apple\u2019s Mac chips are based on the same underlying Arm Holdings Plc architecture as the processors in the iPhone and iPad, enabling thinner products with better battery life and less need for cooling fans.\n(Updates Apple shares in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality\nCities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster\nThe Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It wasn't long ago that smartphone users had plenty of reasons to upgrade after two years. Smartphones were getting significantly better each year. Snappier processors, more vibrant screens, and greatly improved cameras whetted consumers' appetites for new phones.\nToday, innovation in the smartphone industry is tougher to find. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 15 family looks and performs an awful lot like its predecessor. For those with much older iPhones, an upgrade may make sense. But most people who upgraded within the past few years aren't missing much by skipping this generation.\nWhile one month doesn't make a trend, February was a rough month for Apple's most important business. According to UBS, iPhone sales in the U.S. dropped 9% year over year, sales in China were down 16%, and sales in India were down 13%. There was solid growth in Europe, but overall sales were down 4% worldwide. UBS expects Apple to sell 51 million iPhones in the first calendar quarter, down from 56 million last year.\nUBS cited a few reasons for the decline. In China, fierce competition from Huawei and other domestic competitors is proving to be a stiff challenge. In the U.S., the popularity of Samsung's recent Galaxy smartphones and weak carrier upgrade rates are hurting iPhone sales.\nThere could be multiple drivers behind the decline in carrier upgrade rates. One driver is probably that new smartphones just aren't very exciting anymore. With Apple churning out incremental upgrades year after year, it may be getting tough to sell consumers on its latest devices.\nHigher interest rates may also be a factor. Wireless carriers often offer incentives such as cheap financing or big discounts on new smartphones. Now that prevailing interest rates are no longer at historic lows, providing cheap financing has become a more expensive proposition.\nThe interests of wireless carriers and Apple also aren't quite lined up. Carriers use smartphone incentives to help pluck customers from their rivals, but ultimately, the goal is retaining wireless subscribers, not selling phones. While a lower upgrade rate is a major problem for Apple, it's only a minor problem for wireless carriers.\nApple appears to have missed the generative AI boat. The company is reportedly in talks with Alphabet's Google to use the Gemini AI model to power iPhone AI features, a sign that the company is nowhere close to developing something similar on its own.\nThe jury is still out on whether generative AI models run locally on smartphones will prove to be a game-changer. If it is, Apple is probably going to be playing from behind.\nRecent antitrust developments raise the risks for Apple's most important products. The U.S. Justice Department is suing Apple on charges of monopolizing the smartphone market, with one of the key sticking points being the company's efforts to make it difficult for consumers to switch away from the iPhone.\nIf Apple is forced to make changes that lower switching costs for consumers, the cost of its slowing rate of innovation and its AI subservience could be amplified. Companies tend to become more risk-averse as they grow larger, and Apple is the largest of them all.\nOne thing that we can be absolutely sure of is that the iPhone will eventually be disrupted. Given Apple's strategy of incremental upgrades and its AI missteps, I'm willing to bet that whatever ultimately disrupts the iPhone won't be coming from Cupertino.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Secondly, there is a shift in power among the Top 5 companies, which will likely continue as market players adjust their strategies in a post-recovery world.\u201d\nWhile Apple is still the second largest smartphone maker in the world by shipment volume behind Samsung, Chinese firms like Xiaomi and Transsion are gaining momentum in the market. Xiaomi saw shipments rise 33.8% in the quarter to 40.8 million units, while Transsion shipments increased 84.9% to 28.5 million units.\nApple\u2019s China business has been a thorn in the company\u2019s side over the last two quarters. iPhone revenue fell 13% in the first quarter of the year and is expected to drop again when the company reports its Q2 earnings on May 2.\nChina is Apple\u2019s third-largest market behind the Americas and Europe, making the region especially important for the company\u2019s success.\nThe ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and China are also adding to Apple\u2019s difficulties. According to Bloomberg, Chinese officials are increasingly telling workers not to use iPhones or other foreign-made phones in the office.\nApple is also working to wean itself off China as its main manufacturing hub. The company is increasingly looking toward Vietnam and India to take on a larger portion of its manufacturing capabilities. CEO Tim Cook posted a series of photos of himself in Vietnam on Monday to X, formerly Twitter.\nApple is facing a series of challenges ranging from declining iPad and Wearables sales to the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust lawsuit claiming that Apple purposely works to harm competition in the smartphone space. The European Union\u2019s European Commission also hit the company with a $2 billion fine related to antitrust concerns about streaming music. The tech giant is also facing a potential $1 billion lawsuit in the UK related to fees it charges developers that sell apps through the App Store.\nApple shares have taken a beating so far this year, with the stock falling more than 8% since January. Shares of the company are up just 6% over the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 is up more than 20%.\nBut things could start to turn around for the company in the latter half of the year. Apple is widely expected to announce some form of generative AI-based capabilities during its WWDC developer conference in June. If Apple implements the technology in a new and interesting way, it could provide a boost to iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales.\nStill, it\u2019s unclear exactly what Apple will have on offer when it comes to generative AI, and there\u2019s no guarantee it will be a massive success. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have already started introducing the technology on their smartphones, but it\u2019s largely meant for manipulating photos and quick translation.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Apple has lost its spot as the world\u2019s top smartphone maker by sales as Chinese rivals eat into its market share.\niPhone sales dropped by 9.6pc in the first three months of the year to around 50 million, analysts at IDC said, while volumes shipped by Chinese challengers surged.\nBeijing-headquartered rival Xiaomi increased its phone shipments by 33.8pc and budget Chinese technology brand Transsion grew its sales by 84pc.\nApple\u2019s market share fell to 17.3pc in the first three months of 2024 as a result, compared to 20.7pc a year earlier.\nRyan Reith, vice president at IDC, said a \u201cresurgence of Huawei in China\u201d and \u201cnotable gains from Xiaomi\u201d were increasingly challenging Apple and its major rival Samsung.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Samsung is faring better than Apple and claimed the top spot as the world\u2019s most popular smartphone brand by sales, IDC said.\nNabila Popal, research director at IDC, said: \u201cWhile the top two players both saw negative growth in the first quarter, it seems Samsung is in a stronger position overall than they were in recent quarters.\u201d\nOver the past decade, Samsung has consistently held the top spot as the world\u2019s biggest seller of smartphones. However, Apple surpassed its rival in late 2023 after the release of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro, its latest flagship handsets.\nApple\u2019s shares have dipped 5pc so far this year amid market concerns that demand for its iPhones is waning.\nThe tech giant has been searching for its next big technology breakthrough, launching the Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset in February. It is also planning to add new artificial intelligence features to its next line-up of MacBooks and iPhones.\nCompetition is getting more intense in the smartphone market as sales decline.\nThe global smartphone market shrank in 2023 as rising interest rates eroded consumers\u2019 ability to splash out on the latest gadgets. Shipments of phones dropped 4pc compared to 2022, according to data from Canalys.\nHowever, IDC said the wider market appeared to be showing signs of rebounding. Smartphone sales climbed 7.8pc to 289.4 million in the first three months of 2024, the analysts said.\nSeparately on Monday, Samsung agreed to produce its latest generation of semiconductors in the US, securing $6.4bn (\u00a35.1bn) in subsidies from the White House under Joe Biden\u2019s Chips Act.\nSamsung will ramp up a new microchip manufacturing plant in Taylor, Texas, as part of a $40bn spending spree in the US.\nThe US has been spending billions of pounds to attract foreign chipmakers to America in a bid to reinforce its domestic technology supply chain. It comes amid fears China could one day invade Taiwan, which dominates global microchip production.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "Author": "  Nicholas Gordon ",
        "Text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook is on the hunt for new places that can make Apple products. Just a few days ago, Apple pledged to increase investment in Vietnam, already a manufacturing hub for its products. Cook then flew further south to Indonesia\u2014and said Wednesday that he\u2019s ready to \u201clook at\u201d the country\u2019s manufacturing sector.\nAfter meeting Indonesia\u2019s president Joko Widodo, commonly referred to as Jokowi, Cook said that Apple will consider investing in an Indonesia-based supply chain, citing the president\u2019s \u201cdesire to see manufacturing in the country.\u201d\n\u201cThe investment ability in Indonesia is endless. There\u2019s a lot of great places to invest, and we\u2019re investing,\u201d Cook told reporters on Wednesday, without going into specifics.\nNeither Apple nor its suppliers manufacture products in Indonesia. Apple also does not operate a store in the country.\nYet the company manages several developer academies to integrate Indonesian developers into the iOS ecosystem. On Wednesday, Apple said it would open its fourth academy on the island of Bali.\nAn Indonesian minister later added that the government asked the iPhone maker to open two more centers, including one in the country\u2019s new capital on the island of Borneo, named Nusantara.\nIndonesia requires that smartphones sold in the country are made up of at least 35% local components by value; Apple\u2019s phones satisfy the quota due to the company\u2019s investment in local software development.\nJokowi, who will leave office later this year, tried to encourage investment in higher-value manufacturing during his tenure.\nIn particular, he tried to leverage the country\u2019s large reserves of nickel, a key material used in stainless steel and electric batteries. Indonesia banned the export of raw nickel ore in early 2020, spurring Chinese and Korean refiners to invest in local refining capacity.\nChinese EV giant BYD will also invest $1.3 billion in an Indonesian factory, government officials said earlier this year.\nCook\u2019s Indonesia stopover follows a two-day stopover in Vietnam, already a manufacturing hub for Apple and its suppliers.\nDuring his trip, Apple pledged to increase its spending on Vietnam-based suppliers. The company said it has spent $15.7 billion on the country\u2019s supply chain since 2019, creating about 200,000 jobs.\nApple and its suppliers already produce iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and MacBooks in the country. The company relies on 25 suppliers in Vietnam, up from 21 in 2020, according to Reuters.\nChina is Apple\u2019s largest manufacturing hub, but the company is diversifying its supply chains following significant COVID-era disruptions to its China-based manufacturing. Lockdowns in Zhengzhou, home to Apple supplier Foxconn\u2019s most important iPhone plant, significantly disrupted Apple\u2019s 2022 smartphone production ahead of the holiday season.\nIn addition to Vietnam, Apple is also expanding production in India. The company made 14% of its iPhones in the South Asian country last fiscal year, up from 7% during the preceding fiscal year, Bloomberg reported last week.\nApple is also facing a slump in China sales due to renewed competition from domestic brands. Chinese competition helped knock Apple from its perch as the world\u2019s top smartphone seller in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report from research firm IDC.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "In the past 10 years, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have crushed the Nasdaq Composite index. Strong financial results have propelled this business to a $2.6 trillion market capitalization.\nDespite this impressive performance, some investors might worry that this dominant tech enterprise carries $108 billion of long-term debt on its balance sheet. That gargantuan figure alone would qualify as the world's 139th-most-valuable company.\nCan Apple afford this massive amount of debt?\nInvestors can look at some key metrics to determine whether a business is able to handle its debt burden. When scrutinizing Apple in this regard, it's clear that the company has absolutely no problem at all with its borrowings.\nApple's debt ratio of 31% (comparing its debt to assets) has actually come down in recent years. And it demonstrates that there are ample assets backing the company. \nThe business generated an incredible $114 billion in operating income in fiscal 2023. But it only made $3.9 billion in interest payments. This shows that even if a severe recession happened that crushed demand for its popular hardware devices, lowering revenue in the process, Apple could still easily make good on its payments.\nJust because a company has some debt on the books, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a risky stock to own. In fact, in this case, it points to Apple's financial prowess. The tech giant started borrowing aggressively about a decade ago to take advantage of ultra-low interest rates. This has helped to fund its buybacks and dividends.\nMoreover, you'd struggle to find a more profitable enterprise than this one. In the past three fiscal years, Apple generated over $300 billion in free cash flow. Based on this result, one could even make a valid argument that Apple would be able to take on even more debt. In any case, the tech titan's balance sheet is doing just fine right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The new chip will come in at least three main varieties, and Apple is looking to update every Mac model with it, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven\u2019t been announced.\nThe new Macs are underway at a critical time. After peaking in 2022, Mac sales fell 27% in the last fiscal year, which ended in September. In the holiday period, revenue from the computer line was flat. Apple attempted to breathe new life into the Mac business with an M3-focused launch event last October, but those chips didn\u2019t bring major performance improvements over the M2 from the prior year.\nApple also is playing catch-up in AI, where it\u2019s seen as a laggard to Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and other tech peers. The new chips are part of a broader push to weave AI capabilities into all its products.\nApple is aiming to release the updated computers beginning late this year and extending into early next year. There will be new iMacs, a low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, and Mac minis \u2014 all with M4 chips. But the company\u2019s plans could change. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\nApple shares climbed 4.3% to $175.04 on Thursday in New York, the biggest single-day gain in 11 months. They had been down 13% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close.\nThe move will mark a quick refresh schedule for the iMac and MacBook Pro, as both lines were just updated in October. The Mac mini was last upgraded in January 2023.\nApple is then planning to follow up with more M4 Macs throughout 2025. That includes updates to the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air by the spring, the Mac Studio around the middle of the year, and the Mac Pro later in 2025. The MacBook Air received the M3 chip last month, while the Mac Studio and Mac Pro were updated with M2 processors last year.\nThe M4 chip line includes an entry-level version dubbed Donan, more powerful models named Brava and a top-end processor codenamed Hidra. The company is planning to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the components and how they\u2019ll integrate with the next version of macOS, which will be announced in June at Apple\u2019s annual developer conference.\nRead More: Apple Set to Unveil AI Strategy at June 10 Developers Conference\nThe Donan chip is coming to the entry-level MacBook Pro, the new MacBook Airs and a low-end version of the Mac mini, while the Brava chips will run the high-end MacBook Pros and a pricier version of the Mac mini. For the Mac Studio, Apple is testing versions with both a still-unreleased M3-era chip and a variation of the M4 Brava processor.\nThe highest-end Apple desktop, the Mac Pro, is set to get the new Hidra chip. The Mac Pro remains the lower-selling model in the company\u2019s computer lineup, but it has a vocal fan base. After some customers complained about the specifications of Apple\u2019s in-house chips, the company is looking to beef up that machine next year.\nAs part of the upgrades, Apple is considering allowing its highest-end Mac desktops to support as much as a half-terabyte of memory. The current Mac Studio and Mac Pro top out at 192 gigabytes \u2014 far less capacity than on Apple\u2019s previous Mac Pro, which used an Intel Corp. processor. The earlier machine worked with off-the-shelf memory that could be added later and handle as much as 1.5 terabytes. With Apple\u2019s in-house chips, the memory is more deeply integrated into the main processor, making it harder to add more.\nThe big focus for Apple this year is to add new artificial intelligence features across its products. The company is planning to preview a slew of new features at its June developer conference. A large swath of those features are designed to run on the devices themselves \u2014 rather than in remote servers \u2014 and speedier chips will help drive those enhancements. Apple is also planning to make AI-focused upgrades to this year\u2019s iPhone processor.\nThe company\u2019s switch to in-house chips was part of a long-running initiative known as Apple Silicon. The tech giant started using its own semiconductors in the original iPad and iPhone 4 in 2010, before bringing the technology to the Mac in 2020. The goal has been to better unify its hardware and software with underlying components and move away from processors made by Intel.\nSo far, the effort has been a success, helping boost performance and ease the redesign of devices such as the latest MacBook Air, iMac and MacBook Pro. Apple\u2019s Mac chips are based on the same underlying Arm Holdings Plc architecture as the processors in the iPhone and iPad, enabling thinner products with better battery life and less need for cooling fans.\n(Updates Apple shares in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality\nCities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster\nThe Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.41%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.12%.\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 0.59% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.55% and outstripping the S&P 500's loss of 0.9%.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on May 2, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.50, showcasing a 1.32% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year.

This strategic position could either serve as a springboard for resurgence or a potential pitfall if the stock dips below this support level.\nInvestors and market watchers alike are keenly observing whether Apple can leverage its robust cash flows and innovative prowess to bounce back from recent setbacks and continue its legacy of growth and value creation.\nThe $160 to $168 area is a crucial support level where the stock remains well supported for a potential bounce back. The stock has a higher chance of edging higher if it does not plummet below this demand zone. On the other hand, a sell-off followed by a close below this level could open the door for short sellers to push the stock lower.\nNevertheless, Apple could bounce back given that it is in a critical demand zone whereby buyers on the fence could be enticed. Likewise, the Moving Average Convergence and Divergence Indicators have already started showing signs of bouncing back even as they remain below the zero line.\nLastly, the pullback has made Apple relatively cheap compared to its peers trading at a premium valuation. The company's boasts of solid cash flows, buybacks, and a reputation for generating long-term value should continue to fuel optimism of a potential bounce back after the recent slide from 52-week highs.\nAAPL Data by GuruFocus\nThere is no denying that Apple is in a difficult period as it deals with a high-profile antitrust probe over claims it blocks rivals from accessing hardware and software features in its devices. Yet, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), history offers some guidance that the market reaction in the very early going of such regulatory pressures may be worse than the ultimate effects. Apple has been leading efforts to meet these concerns with various compromises, including changes to its payment system and adopting right-to-repair policies, which may open up new business opportunities.\nNext, the growing concerns over slowing iPhone sales in China and other key markets have rattled the stock's sentiment on Wall Street. Even though the iPhone remains the company's flagship product, its lack of significant upgrades and updates from previous versions has made it difficult to ship more products as expected. With customers opting to hold on to their older-generation iPhones rather than upgrading, Apple has yet to generate as much revenue as it would have expected.\nApple's amazing return on equity and return on invested capital have effectively placed a target on its back in the fiercely competitive technological scene. The most recent reports of smartphone sales have seen Apple just beaten by Samsung (XKRX:005930), marking the beginning of heightened competition within the smartphone sector.\nThe current state of tensions around the world and threats of hardware and software bans could ripple across tech giants such as Apple, which relies on international markets. Chinese companies are taking an ever-greater share, partly due to nationalistic preferences at the expense of foreign companies, and this is likely to impact Apple's sales in this all-important market.\nHowever, CEO Tim Cook has managed a tightrope of strategic relations with China, forging ahead with diversification in manufacturing to other Asian nations such as India, Indonesia and Vietnam to spread out risk and open up new growth opportunities.\nFinally, despite these risks, Apple is in very healthy financial condition. It has the highest rating from every major credit agency, a \"wide moat\" status. Therefore, its financial health underlines the company's ability to weather market volatility and invest in innovation.\nWith new products such as the Vision Pro, which was recently launched and not well-accepted, the company is sticking to its guns on an innovation drive. Exiting from the car project definitely means gearing the company's efforts toward new and high-potential profit markets, such as home robotics, where its technological advantage of vision recognition and voice command can really shine.\nAdditionally, as per former software engineer and tech expert Vance Tran, mature businesses can leverage Apple's innovative spirit and new product ventures to access new markets and revenue streams. Specifically, companies in the automotive supply chain and software development sectors stand to benefit significantly from the Apple Car and the increasing demand for apps and services within Apple's ecosystem.\nIndeed, the company's first-quarter earnings registered an upsurge of 16%, with solid contributions to revenue from the Americas and Europe, while performance was weaker in China. The company's strategy in emerging markets could offset these challenges, where a rapidly increasing middle class with a huge appetite for quality consumer tech can offset an overly competitive landscape.\nAdditionally, Apple plans to continue growing earnings per share by 10% or better annually with constant product enhancements, its highly efficient operations and a strong brand that can command premium pricing. Together, these things enable Apple to be well-positioned for long-term, sustained growth.\nA possible increase in the dividend accompanying the second-quarter earnings and a conservative dividend policy maintained by Apple alongside the robust business model ensure that shareholder returns can indeed be grown, mostly regarding capital gains. The fact that peers against which comparison is made, including Microsoft and Samsung, are priced appropriately with respect to Apple means that there is good investment potential here, mostly based on the potential to earn from the company and its robust market position.\nLastly, with a persistent forecast for long-term earnings growth, Apple makes a strong case for investors looking for sustained returns from this global leader in technology. Therefore, with an earnings per share estimate of $6.57 in 2024 and a price-earnings multiple of 30, the stock can easily get back on track and reach $197 by year's end.\nAs Apple continues exploring new growth areas to offset losses on its iPhone product line, it still generates optimum shareholder value. The company already has a $77 billion buyback program, the biggest in the industry, which underlines its robust financial health and management confidence about its prospects.\nWhile Apple has yet to detail the number of shares it intends to repurchase, any buyback should result in a reduction in shares in circulation, in return increasing earnings per share, all else equal. The same earnings shared among small shares will always be worth more. By reducing the share count by 2% to 3% a year, the company should increase shareholders' return by a comparable amount annually.\nIf the management team had not been confident about long-term prospects amid the iPhone headwinds, the buyback program could have been cut and the amount redirected to other projects. Therefore, the $77 billion buyback program underscores the company's stability and growth potential.\nOver the past decade, the company has spent nearly $658 billion on buybacks. Yet it continues to finance its research and development operations as one of the ways of staying ahead of the pack with unique products and services. In contrast, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) has spent nearly $240 billion on buybacks, opting to dedicate a good chunk of its cash flows toward research and development investments.\nGiven that Apple has been able to maintain its edge while offering one of the most sought-after smartphones and growing its software offering, this affirms the company's commitment to innovation.\nAmid fluctuations in its iconic iPhone line and challenging market conditions, Apple stands resilient, backed by strategic shifts toward high-potential markets like home robotics and sustained financial maneuvers, including a $77 billion buyback program.\nAs Apple adapts to changing consumer trends and regulatory landscapes, it continues to drive shareholder value through innovative products and a robust business model aimed at long-term growth. Thus, investors should watch closely as Apple navigates these waters, bolstering its position with solid cash flows and a legacy of strategic foresight.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Concerned by the company's late arrival to the artificial intelligence (AI) game (and its consequent need to iPhone Google for help), share prices of the iEverything stock are down about 12% since the start of 2024.\nAnd that's not all. Investors also seem worried Apple has lost its mojo in China. Last summer, the Chinese Communist Party banned the use of Apple iPhones in government offices, giving Chinese consumers a none-too-subtle cue that Apple is persona non grata in the Middle Kingdom.\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives called this \"one of the more difficult China demand environments seen the last five years,\" in a note covered on TheFly.com on Tuesday. And yet, Ives suspects Apple will come out on top -- and urges investors not to miss the \"forest for the trees.\"\nApple's still a buy, insists Ives, and with a $250 target price, he's predicting the stock will gain 47% over the next 52 weeks.\nIs Ives right? The analyst argues Apple has a \"golden installed base\" of 1.5 billion iPhones in use around the world -- a big fanbase of potential buyers of its upcoming iPhone 16, and a bigger market for Apple services on all those devices. And yet, there's another way of looking at this.\nWhat if those 1.5 billion users are already happy with their iPhones? What if a lot of them decline to upgrade to iPhone 16, and some of them even decide to switch to Android?\nWith nearly 1-in-4 persons around the world already owning an iPhone, the simple fact that Apple has already penetrated so much of the mobile phone market makes it that much harder for the company to keep growing quickly. Indeed, long-term forecasts see Apple's earnings growing barely 10% a year over the next five years. That's not particularly fast for a supposed growth stock costing a rich 26 times earnings, like Apple.\nIves may think this stock has another 47% of stock appreciation in it. But I have my doubts.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is deepening its involvement with China while expanding its production in Southeast Asia and India, illustrating the iPhone maker\u2019s delicate balancing act between political pressures and business needs.\nIn\u00a02023,\u00a0Apple increased its number of China-based suppliers and manufacturing sites, reducing its reliance on suppliers from Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, according to a Nikkei Asia\u00a0review\u00a0of Apple\u2019s latest official supplier list.\nApple publishes an official list of its suppliers nearly every year. The most recent list includes 187 companies, accounting for 98% of the company\u2019s procurement for fiscal 2023.\nSince 2020, Chinese suppliers have become the largest group within Apple\u2019s supplier network, growing to 52 in the last year from 48 in 2022. The number of manufacturing or development facilities in China, including those owned by domestic and foreign companies, increased by 10 to 286.\nAs Apple accelerates its supply chain shift to Southeast Asia amid the ongoing U.S.-China tech conflict, its ties with China continue to deepen.\nThe number of Apple suppliers in Vietnam surged by 40% to 35 last year, while the number in Thailand increased by about a third to 24. The number of suppliers in India remained stable at 14.\nHowever, this growing presence in India and Southeast Asia does not necessarily mean a reduced dependence on China.\nPrior reports conjectured that Apple reduced its dependence on China due to growing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China\u00a0after which\u00a0Washington imposed a semiconductor technology embargo on China which included import of sophisticated AI chips from\u00a0Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) and other chip designers.\nNikkei Asia\u2019s analysis indicates that approximately 37% of the 35 suppliers in\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0are from China and Hong Kong, including AirPods assemblers Luxshare and Goertek and iPad assembler BYD.\nAll three have increased their production capacity in the country to serve Apple.\nTaiwanese suppliers remain the second-largest group in the Apple supply chain, followed by U.S., Japanese, and South Korean suppliers.\nA significant portion of its supply chain is in China, and revenue from Greater China \u2014 the world\u2019s largest consumer electronics market \u2014 still accounted for 17% of its total revenue in the December quarter.\nAccording to IDC data,\u00a0Apple\u2019s shipments in\u00a0the first quarter of this year dropped nearly 10% globally, a steeper year-over-year decline than peers like Samsung and Xiaomi experienced.\nPrior reports indicated that Apple\u00a0is offering\u00a0the iPhone 15 series at steep discounts in China through resellers, implying softening demand.\nMorgan Stanley\u00a0analyst Erik Woodring\u00a0anticipates a slight revenue\u00a0increase for the March quarter.\nStill, he expects a significant downward revision for the June quarter guidance compared to consensus, which may initially disappoint the market.\nDespite this, he sees potential for a relief rally at Apple, especially with the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) expected to showcase new AI software features.\nWoodring notes the possibility of a nearly 30% upside to his new price target and a pivotal AI-driven iPhone cycle in fiscal 2025, focusing\u00a0on total revenue, China iPhone shipments, and Services revenue growth\u00a0in his analysis.\nApple stock gained 4% in the last 12 months.\u00a0Investors can gain exposure\u00a0to\u00a0the stock via\u00a0Vanguard Information Tech ETF\u00a0(NYSE:VGT) and\u00a0SPDR Select Sector Fund\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Technology\u00a0(NYSE:XLK).\nPrice Action:\u00a0AAPL shares traded higher by 0.39% at $170.55 premarket at the last check Friday.\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This content was partially produced\u00a0with the help of\u00a0AI tools and\u00a0was\u00a0reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nImage Source \u2013 Apple\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "For many years now, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has been a favorite of individual and institutional investors alike. For most of its recent history, analysts have been bullish on the tech giant's shares too.\nHowever, there are always those whose views run counter to the conventional, and one such contrarian just reiterated his bearish take on Apple stock in a new research note. Could he be right?\nThe rare Apple bear in question is Thiago Kapulskis from the Brazilian financial services company Itau-BBA. On Monday, Kapulskis published an update of his Apple view in which he continued to rate the stock an underperform (sell, in other words) with a price target of $162 per share. That implies a 4.3% downside over the next 12 months from the current share price.\nThe analyst's new note on the company came a day after tech sector research firm IDC published its latest data on smartphones. The report was not favorable for Apple, as IDC found that shipments of its iconic iPhone fell by roughly 10% year over year in the first quarter. Compounding that, Apple lost its crown as the top smartphone purveyor in the world, sliding to the No. 2 spot behind its archrival in the segment, Samsung.\nIn his note, Kapulskis wrote that \"this is a demonstration that momentum remains weak for Apple.\"\nIn the same note, however, the Itau-BBA analyst pointed out that the IDC data makes it more important that Apple develop and sell an iPhone loaded with some useful artificial intelligence (AI) features.\nIf any company is capable of harnessing AI effectively in a device, it's Apple. Even if it continues to be something of a laggard in handsets, we should remember that the company is more than just the iPhone -- its revenue from services has been growing, at times impressively, and it's doing well in other product niches too.

        "Title": "Apple is aiming the Vision Pro at enterprises",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "It\u2019s been just over two months since Apple (APPL) launched its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. At $3,500, the device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, is a pricey proposition for many consumers. But the enterprise market is another beast altogether, which is why the company is keen on showing off the Vision Pro\u2019s business bona fides. After all, if Apple can entice large businesses to purchase Vision Pros in bulk, it would provide a solid boost to overall sales numbers.\nApple has a history of pushing what might seem to be consumer products into businesses. The iPhone is a mainstay of offices around the world, as are its MacBook and Mac lines of laptops and desktops. And while Apple doesn't release numbers for how many of its product sales go toward consumers and how many go toward businesses, having those enterprise clients all but guarantees a continuous stream of upgrades as older devices reach the end of their lifecycles and newer, more powerful ones come to market.\nTo that end, I sat down for a demo of some of the enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro and came away impressed by what the headset has to offer. Much of what the company offers seemed to provide genuinely worthwhile use cases for workers, though, I'm not a jet engine mechanic, so I can't say for sure.\nAnd while these were enterprise apps, they still managed to feel as immersive as their consumer-based counterparts. Though, I don't expect anyone to start downloading them from the App Store for fun.\nApple isn\u2019t alone in the AR/VR enterprise space. Rival Meta (META) also offers its Meta Quest line of headsets as a business product complete with enterprise-focused administrative software and controls.\nStill, demonstrating the Vision Pro's enterprise chops could prove to be a lucrative move for Apple as it ramps up headset sales in hopes of turning the device into a major moneymaker.\nDuring my brief 30-minute demo with Apple, I tried four different apps: SAP Analytics Cloud, Complete HeartX, Resolve, and JigSpace. Each of the apps featured interactive augmented reality functionality designed to help workers do everything from training for specific tasks and studying pieces of equipment they may have to service in the future to getting a better understanding of their business\u2019s overall performance.\nThe most impressive demo of the bunch was Complete HeartX. The app, developed by Elsevier, is designed to help healthcare workers, such as nursing students, get a better sense of how the heart functions in a living person and how to draw blood.\nUsers see a fully 3D model of a person and use their hands to pinpoint a spot of the model\u2019s body to reveal the location of blood vessels, veins, and the heart. The app also offers a 3D model of a beating heart that helps users better understand how blood flows throughout the body.\nSAP Analytics Cloud, meanwhile, allows users to view datasets in a 3D environment, making them easier to digest than simply reading them on a spreadsheet. The demo I saw involved viewing a corporate headquarters with small pegs floating above each building.\nLooking at a building and tapping my fingers together pulled up the number of employees that worked in each building on specific days. It also provided a breakdown of how many people parked at the complex\u2019s parking garages and whether they drove EVs or traditional gas-powered cars.\nThe Resolve app allowed me to view a schematic of an HVAC system and then see a digital version of it at scale above me. The idea is to give HVAC workers a sense of where things like air ducts and sprinkler heads are located before going to a job site, so they don't have to waste time searching while on the job.\nThen there was my demo of JigSpace, which entailed placing a massive jet engine in a room and pulling it apart by staring at individual pieces to select them and tapping my fingers together to tear them out.\nEach of the demos offered excellent visuals and interactivity, but I didn\u2019t see anything that other headsets don't offer. I\u2019ve used AR/VR devices in the past to perform faux surgery on 3D models of people, look at accurate representations of things like cars and planes, and more.\nThe Vision Pro does, however, bring along an incredibly easy-to-use interface, interoperability with other Apple devices, and an overall cleaner operating system. If Apple can convince a relatively small number of businesses to purchase the Vision Pro, it could give the headset a nice sales boost.\nWe\u2019ll likely get some inkling as to overall Vision Pro uptake when Apple announces its second quarter earnings in the coming weeks.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Apple (AAPL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 2, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\nRevenues are expected to be $89.99 billion, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?\nFor Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.93%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of +4.31%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nApple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Sweta Killa ",
        "Text": "All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on May 2. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.Apple shares are down about 7.6% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s decline of 3.9%. The trend is expected to reverse, given that the tech giant has a reasonable chance to beat earnings estimates. It saw positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).This has put investors\u2019 focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and sport a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Apple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal second quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year decline of 0.7% for earnings and 5.1% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.The stock has a top Growth Score of A. It currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations. Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 60.71% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.Based on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $204.88. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00.\nOn the last earnings call, the tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the ongoing quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that iPhone sales in the March quarter would be similar to last year\u2019s $51.33 billion in revenues. This excludes $5 billion in sales attributed to outperformance a year ago as supply recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns and caught up with demand (read: Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings).\nApple stock has been struggling with concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Sales of its flagship product are facing significant headwinds in the crucial Chinese market due to rising competition from domestic smartphone makers as well as national security concerns. Additionally, consumers globally are holding their iPhone devices for longer before upgrading, further weighing on demand and sales growth.According to the preliminary data from research firm IDC, Apple lost its crown to South Korean rival Samsung as the world\u2019s biggest mobile phone seller after its shipments fell about 10% in the quarter ended March. Samsung retook the lead in the global market with a 20.8% share, beating Apple\u2019s 17.3% share, which has been dented by slowing sales in China.IDC revealed that Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones in the quarter ended March, down from the 55.4 million units in the year-ago quarter. It was the biggest drop in iPhone sales since COVID-19 lockdowns caused global supply chain chaos in 2022. A separate new report from market research firm Counterpoint Research shows that Apple\u2019s iPhone sales dropped sharply by 19.1% year over year in the quarter ended March in China amid strong competition from domestic brand Huawei.\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index. It holds about 65 securities in its basket, with Apple making up 20.3% share.

        "Text": "By Sin\u00e9ad Carew\n(Reuters) -Shares in Apple Inc closed up 2.5% on Monday after a well-known analyst at Bernstein Societe Generale Group upgraded the stock to an \"outperform\" rating, pointing to the prospects for phone replacement phone sales with help from generative artificial intelligence updates.\nApple registered its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than two weeks after the upgrade, which marked the stock's first \"buy\" equivalent rating from Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi since early 2018.\nSacconaghi upgraded the stock from \"market perform\" and wrote that Apple had been hurt by a weak iPhone 15 cycle as well as fears its China business is structurally impaired.\nBut the analyst argued that China weakness is \"more cyclical than structural\" and that its business there has \"exhibited much higher volatility\" than Apple's overall business.\nAnd Sacconaghi wrote that \"replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle.\"\nLooking to 2025, he is estimating that the company could report $416.9 billion in revenue and $7.40 earnings per share, which would beat consensus expectations for revenue of $412.1 billion and $7.13 EPS. He also said iPhone unit sales could grow 10% year-over-year to 248 million.\nAnd while Sacconaghi said that expectations are low for Apple's fiscal second quarter results, due out on Thursday, he noted the stock is \"entering its seasonally strong trading period\" as it has outperformed in the three months before its iPhone launches in 15 of the last 17 years.\nSacconaghi kept his price target of $195, which compares with Apple's closing price of $173.50 on Monday and its session high of $176.03 on the day. The median price target for the stock is $200, according to LSEG data.\nThe analyst had kept a \"market-perform\" rating on Apple since he downgraded it from \"outperform\" in February 2018. He had started coverage with a \"market-perform\" rating in November 2006 before upgrading it to \"outperform\" in October 2008.\nApple shares were last down 9.9% year-to-date after rising 48% in 2023.\n(Reporting by Sin\u00e9ad Carew, Medha Singh; editing by Lance Tupper and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Author": "  Lionel Lim ",
        "Text": "For years, \"Asia\" for Apple usually meant China. The world's second-largest economy is one of Apple's most important overseas markets, and a massive manufacturing hub. \"There\u2019s no supply chain in the world that\u2019s more critical to us than China,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a trip to China in March. But with China sales slumping and possible threats to its supply chain, Apple could be taking a closer look at new Asian markets.\nApple's CEO just wrapped up a five-day tour of Southeast Asia, stopping by Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore in a trip that could be an effort by the company to \"hedge its supply chain bets\" and \"ease the path\" for later investment in the fast-growing region.\nSoutheast Asia is one of several emerging markets, alongside India and Latin America, that Apple needs to target for future growth, says Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.\n\u201cApple\u2019s brand image is perceived as high-end in the Southeast Asian region and holds a favorable position in consumers\u2019 mindsets,\u201d he says. The analyst anticipates \u201cfurther enhancement\u201d in Apple\u2019s sales strategies for Southeast Asia as the region\u2019s consumption levels improve.\nSoutheast Asia, for now, makes up a small, but fast-growing, percentage of the iPhone market.\n\u201cApple shipped just under 10 million iPhones per year to Southeast Asia last year, which accounted for less than 5% of global iPhone shipments. But that was still 32% growth for iPhones in Southeast Asia,\u201d Bryan Ma, vice president of client devices research at IDC, says.\nBut Ma suspects that Cook\u2019s interest in Southeast Asia is driven not by retail, but manufacturing.\n\u201cI suspect that an even bigger motivation behind the visit though is for the company to hedge its supply chain bets as the industry continues to diversify from China. That means not just meetings with suppliers who have operations in the region, but also with governments who can ease the path for investments in their countries later,\u201d Ma said.\nChina is still Apple's largest manufacturing hub, but the COVID pandemic demonstrated to the iPhone maker the risk of having everything in one place. COVID lockdowns in Zhengzhou, sometimes known as \"iPhone City,\" lowered Apple's smartphone production in 2022. Apple later partly blamed COVID disruptions for a 5% year-on-year drop in revenue for the 2022 holiday quarter.\nMore broadly, the U.S. is encouraging companies to \"de-risk\" by diversifying supply chains away from China.\nCook\u2019s first stop was Vietnam, already part of Apple\u2019s supply chain. The country boasts a typical export-oriented manufacturing economy, and can leverage its close proximity to existing manufacturing supply chains in China.\nDuring his two-day stay in Vietnam, Cook pledged to increase spending on Vietnam-based suppliers during a meeting with Pham Minh Chinh, the country\u2019s prime minister, in Hanoi. The company says it\u2019s already spent close to $16 billion on the country\u2019s supply chain since 2019, creating about 200,000 jobs.\nCook then traveled to Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy and most populous country. During a meeting with the country\u2019s outgoing president, Joko Widodo, Cook said he would consider setting up manufacturing facilities in the country.\nApple currently has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia. Instead, the company has set up several app developer academics since 2018. Apple said it would open its fourth developer academy in Bali during Cook's visit.\nIndonesia requires smartphones sold in the country to be made up of at least 35% local components by volume, though Apple satisfies the requirement, despite the lack of local production, through its developer academies.\nThe government hopes the U.S. tech giant will go beyond software. Indonesia\u2019s industry minister, who was also at the meeting with Cook and Widodo, suggested after the meeting that Apple could partner with Indonesian companies to obtain components, even if it does not set up a manufacturing facility.\nCook\u2019s final stop on his Southeast Asian tour was Singapore, the city-state with the region\u2019s highest per capita income. The country is home to three of Apple\u2019s five Southeast Asian stores. (The other two are in Thailand, and Apple is reportedly considering its first store in Malaysia)\nUpon Cook's arrival, Apple announced that it would invest over $250 million to grow its campus in the city-state. Apple opened its first facility in 1981, with 72 employees focused on the Apple II personal computer. The company says it now uses Singapore as a regional hub for critical roles and currently employs over 3,600 staff.\nApple's CEO met Singapore's prime minister-to-be, Lawrence Wong, on Friday. On LinkedIn, Wong wrote that he discussed \"opportunities in Southeast Asia\" and \"the close partnership between Singapore and Apple\" in his meeting with Cook.\nOn a popular Singaporean radio show on Friday, Cook said he wanted to invest more in R&D in the country. \u201cSingapore has always held a special place in my heart,\u201d he told listeners.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

That could come in the form of an increased dividend, an increased stock buyback program, or both. Mohan expects a 5% dividend increase and a $90 billion stock buyback program.\nSecond, Mohan expects Apple to make a series of AI-related announcements at its upcoming WWDC software developers conference in June. That could excite investors, as Apple has largely been absent from announcing its AI capabilities when compared to its mega-cap tech peers.\nThird, Mohan said he expects Apple to launch an AI-enabled iPhone 16 later this year that will offer on-device generative AI capabilities. That should help accelerate the company's earnings power.\n\"Our checks indicate that all 4 new models of iPhone this year could be launched with the same application processor (A18) that can enable improved AI/machine learning performance,\" Mohan said.\nFinally, Mohan said that Apple's profit margins have considerable upside as the company develops chips in-house, lowering its component costs, and as it reduces its reliance on public cloud providers. Mohan also said that Apple's Services business is poised to see strong revenue growth thanks to its Licensing, App Store, iCloud, and subscription offerings like Apple TV+ and Apple Music.\nFor its earnings next week, Bank of America expects Apple to beat Wall Street's estimates and predicts the company will report $1 billion in revenue from sales of its Vision Pro.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

The 9.6% year-on-year drop is the steepest for Apple since Covid lockdowns snarled supply chains in 2022, the researchers said.\nThe Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker has struggled to sustain sales in China since the debut of its latest model in September. The resurgence of rivals from Huawei Technologies Co. to Xiaomi Corp. and a Beijing-imposed ban on foreign devices in the workplace have all weighed on sales. The IDC data provides the first snapshot of the global performance of Apple\u2019s most important product ahead of earnings on May 2.\nShares were down less than 1% in premarket trading in New York on Monday.\nThe drop in iPhone shipments is significant given the overall mobile market registered its best growth in years. Smartphone makers shipped 289.4 million handsets in the period, marking a 7.8% rise from the trough of a year ago, when many manufacturers were grappling with a surfeit of unsold devices. Samsung Electronics Co. regained the top spot in the March quarter, while budget-focused Transsion increased shipments by 85% and Xiaomi bounced back to close the gap on second-place Apple.\n\u201cThe smartphone market is emerging from the turbulence of the last two years both stronger and changed,\u201d said Nabila Popal, research director at IDC. \u201cWhile Apple has been super resilient and seen a lot of growth in shipments and share over the last few years, it will be a challenge for it to maintain the pace of growth and the peak share it saw in 2023. As the market recovers further in 2024, IDC expects Android to grow much faster than Apple.\u201d\nProminent Apple suppliers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Murata Manufacturing Co. and LG Innotek Co. fell in Asia trading on Monday, amid a broader selloff on fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nXiaomi\u2019s 1Q handset shipments of 40.8 million units, according to IDC, jumped 33.8% year over year while both Apple and Samsung declined. Its strong handset sales were likely driven by a recovery in its overseas market and might lead to high-teens sales growth in the first quarter.\n- Steven Tseng and Sean Chen, analysts\nClick here for the research\nDuring the pandemic, Apple\u2019s iPhone showed the greatest resilience as consumers pulled back from purchases of smartphones by most of its Android-powered rivals. That inventory buildup led to aggressive pricing by Chinese competitors like Xiaomi, which took months to deplete stocks and are now starting to ramp shipments back up. Huawei\u2019s surprise return to prominence last year \u2014 with its own made-in-China chip and HarmonyOS operating system on the Mate 60 series \u2014 has been eroding Apple\u2019s share of China\u2019s premium market since August.\n\u201cIncreased competition in China is a big part of Apple\u2019s decline in Q1,\u201d Popal said. Elsewhere, a number of regions started the year with excess iPhone inventory after heavy shipments in the final months of 2023, she added.\nAverage selling prices for handsets are rising, as consumers increasingly opt for premium models that they intend to hold on to for longer, IDC\u2019s researchers found. Apple, which consistently maintains the highest ASP in the industry, has led the way in this, with consumers showing a distinct preference for its higher-tier models. Still, the company has this year resorted to unusual discounts to spur sales, with some retail partners in China taking as much as $180 off the regular price.\nApple\u2019s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Antitrust: QuickTake\nIn March, Apple opened a large new store in the center of financial hub Shanghai, with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in attendance. China is host to the company\u2019s biggest retail network outside the US and accounts for roughly a fifth of sales, largely driven by the iPhone. Many of the attendees who spoke to Bloomberg at the Shanghai event had acquired their iPhones more than two years ago. And while those Apple fans said they intended to remain within the company\u2019s ecosystem, some said they would also consider Huawei\u2019s Mate 60 successor or foldable device options from rivals.\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui.\n(Updates with premarket share trading in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store\nFor Multinationals, Africa\u2019s Allure Is Fading\nRents Are the Fed\u2019s \u2018Biggest Stumbling Block\u2019 in Taming US Inflation\nThe AI Chatbot That Could Transform Business School Accreditation\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Apple's shipments tumbled 19% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, the company's worst performance since 2020, according to data from Counterpoint Research.\nThe U.S. company now has market share of around 15.7%, down from 19.7% a year ago.

The Chinese smartphone maker's sales in the first quarter of 2024 jumped by almost 70%. It now has 15.5% of China's phone market, putting it just behind Apple. Counterpoint partly attributed Huawei's growth to the company's 5G smartphone, giving the tech giant \"a massive share in the $600+ premium segment.\"\nHONOR, a former Huawei subsidiary spun off in 2020, is in second place after its sales grew 11.5% year-on-year.\nApple led the Chinese smartphone market for 2023 as a whole, ahead of Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi, according to Counterpoint data,\nFierce competition in China helped to knock Apple from its perch as the top global seller of smartphones last quarter, according to an IDC report released last week. South Korea's Samsung is now in first place.\nChinese consumers could be attracted by the price of Huawei's 5G phone, which is cheaper than Apple's iPhone.

The iPhone maker is dealing with greater regulatory scrutiny: Beijing reportedly told government officials and employees at state-owned enterprises to stop using iPhones, and regulators ordered Apple to remove several foreign programs, like WhatsApp, Threads and Signal, from its China app store last week on \"national security concerns.\"\nApple is also trying to diversify its supply chain to rely less on Chinese suppliers.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Apple Inc. has teams investigating a push into personal robotics, a field with the potential to become one of the company\u2019s ever-shifting \u201cnext big things,\u201d according to people familiar with the situation.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nKim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War Scenarios\nTSMC Facilities to Resume Production Overnight After Quake\nA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead\nTrump Media\u2019s Business Doesn\u2019t Matter\nApple Explores Home Robotics as Potential \u2018Next Big Thing\u2019 After Car Fizzles\nEngineers at Apple have been exploring a mobile robot that can follow users around their homes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the skunk-works project is private. The iPhone maker also has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.\nThough the effort is still in the beginning stages \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if the products will ultimately be released \u2014 Apple is under growing pressure to find new sources of revenue. It scrapped an electric vehicle project in February, and a push into mixed-reality goggles is expected to take years to become a major moneymaker.\nWith robotics, Apple could gain a bigger foothold in consumers\u2019 homes and capitalize on advances in artificial intelligence. But it\u2019s not yet clear what approach it might take. Though the robotic smart display is much further along than the mobile bot, it has been added and removed from the company\u2019s product road map over the years, according to the people.\nThe robotics work is happening within Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division and its AI and machine-learning group, which is run by John Giannandrea. Matt Costello and Brian Lynch \u2014 two executives focused on home products \u2014 have overseen the hardware development. Still, Apple hasn\u2019t committed to either project as a company, and the work is still considered to be in the early research phase. A spokeswoman declined to comment.\nApple investors reacted coolly to the news, with the stock paring earlier gains after Bloomberg reported on the robotics work. It was up less than 1% at $169.65 at the close in New York. Shares of Roomba maker iRobot Corp., meanwhile, briefly jumped as much as 17% \u2014 a sign investors thought it might benefit from Apple\u2019s interest in the field. But the rally faded, and the stock gained less than 2% by the close.\nBefore the EV project was canceled, Apple told its top executives that the company\u2019s future revolved around three areas: automotive, the home and mixed reality. But now the car isn\u2019t happening and Apple has already released its first mixed-reality product, the Vision Pro headset. So the focus has shifted to other future opportunities, including how Apple can better compete in the smart home market.\nRead More: Vision Pro Is Latest Bid to Prove Consumers Can Embrace Headsets\nThe table-top robotics project first excited senior Apple executives a few years ago, including hardware engineering chief John Ternus and members of the industrial design team. The idea was to have the display mimic the head movements \u2014 such as nodding \u2014 of a person on a FaceTime session. It would also have features to precisely lock on to a single person among a crowd during a video call.\nBut the company has been concerned about whether consumers would be willing to pay top dollar for such a device. There have also been technical challenges related to balancing the weight of a robotic motor on a small stand. The primary obstacle has been disagreement among Apple executives over whether to move forward with the product at all, according to the people.\nNear its campus in Cupertino, California, Apple has a secret facility that resembles the inside of a house \u2014 a site where it can test future devices and initiatives for the home. Apple has been exploring other ideas for that market, including a new home hub device with an iPad-like display.\nApple\u2019s pursuit of the \u201cnext big thing\u201d has been an obsession since the Steve Jobs era. But it\u2019s become harder to envision a product that could ever match the iPhone, which accounted for 52% of the company\u2019s $383.3 billion in sales last year.\nA car had the potential to add hundreds of billions of dollars to Apple\u2019s revenue, in part because the vehicles were expected to sell for roughly $100,000 a pop. Few other products have that kind of growth potential, but Apple has a number of projects in the works, including an updated Vision Pro, touch-screen Macs, AirPods with built-in cameras, and new health technologies like a noninvasive blood sugar monitor.\nArtificial intelligence is another major focus, even if Apple is playing catch-up in the realm of chatbots and other generative technology. That\u2019s where there could be some overlap with the robotics work. While still in the earliest stages, Apple AI researchers are investigating the use of algorithms to help bots navigate cluttered spaces within people\u2019s homes.\nRead More: Apple\u2019s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Antitrust: QuickTake\nIf the work advances, Apple wouldn\u2019t be the first tech giant to develop a home robot. Amazon.com Inc. introduced a model called Astro in 2021 that currently costs $1,600. But the company was slow to offer the device in major quantities, and it remains a niche product. The company debuted a more business-focused version of the rolling bot last year designed to work as a security guard.\nPerhaps the most popular home robot remains the Roomba vacuum, which debuted more than two decades ago. Amazon agreed to acquire iRobot in 2022, but regulatory opposition ultimately doomed the deal. Other companies have also presented the idea of humanoid robots that mimic the size and movements of people.\nA silver lining to Apple\u2019s failed car endeavor is that it provided the underpinnings for other initiatives. The neural engine \u2014 the company\u2019s AI chip inside of iPhones and Macs \u2014 was originally developed for the car. The project also laid the groundwork for the Vision Pro because Apple investigated the use of virtual reality while driving.\nThe robot work got a similar start, originating within Apple\u2019s Titan car project around 2019. That\u2019s when the effort was run by Doug Field, now a top EV executive at Ford Motor Co.\nAt the time, Field tapped a series of executives to work on robotics initiatives, ranging from nearly silent indoor drones to home robots. The group included Lynch; Nick Sims, a former Google home products manager; and Dave Scott, who left Apple in 2021 to briefly run a mobile MRI machine company and then returned in 2022 to work on the Vision Pro. Hanns Wolfram Tappeiner, the co-founder of AI and robotics company Anki, is also involved.\nSoon after Field left Apple in 2021, the robotics work was shifted to the home devices group. And at least one former hardware team from the shuttered car project was recently repurposed to the work on home devices and robotics. The car\u2019s operating system \u2014 dubbed by some as safetyOS \u2014 could also theoretically be tailored for robots, according to people familiar with the effort.\nThe original concept for the robot was a device that could navigate entirely on its own without human intervention \u2014 like the car \u2014 and serve as a videoconferencing tool. One pie-in-the-sky idea within Apple was having it be able to handle chores, like cleaning dishes in a sink. But that would require overcoming extraordinarily difficult engineering challenges \u2014 something that\u2019s unlikely this decade.\nOn its website, Apple is advertising for robotics-related roles, indicating that it\u2019s trying to expand the teams working on the project.\n\u201cOur team works at the intersection of modern machine learning and robotics to shape the AI that will power the next generation of Apple products,\u201d according to the description of one job. \u201cWe are looking for innovative and hardworking ML and robotics researchers and engineers that help us research, define, and develop complex intelligent robotic systems and experiences in the real world.\u201d\n(Updates share reaction in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s X Has a Porn Problem\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit\u2014With an Uncertain Future\nHow Hertz\u2019s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways\nEV Rise Helps BYD Overtake Geely to Become China\u2019s Car King\nCanada\u2019s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

However, some customers haven\u2019t been happy with the performance. Erin Lawrence, a professional tech reviewer at Tech Gadgets International, detailed her experience with AirPods in a video review.\n\u201cFrom my own experience, I\u2019ve had constant and ongoing problems with mine that are incredibly frustrating,\u201d said Lawrence. \u201cMine have just stopped working.

When looking for a solution to her problem, Lawrence was disappointed once again.\n\u201cWhile in some cases Apple has been known to replace potentially defective AirPods, mine were out of warranty so I was on the hook for replacement. I\u2019ve ended up having to replace both the left and right pods at my own expense.\u201d said Lawrence.\nPrice: Varies\nSo you\u2019ve dropped hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone and now you\u2019re looking into the accessories. Since basically everything\u2013including the charger\u2013is separate from the phone, you might think you have to purchase the accessories for the phone to work best. This isn\u2019t entirely true. You don\u2019t need to purchase every accessory for your Apple product for it to reach its full potential.\n\u201cApple is known for over-priced accessories,\u201d said Hall. \u201cA notable example can be seen in the \u2018Apple Mac Pro Wheels Kit\u2019\u2013which are just wheels for your Mac\u2013priced at $699.99.\u201d\nHall said if you purchase extra bells and whistles for your phone, you can find better-priced accessories elsewhere.\n\u201cApple offers high-quality products; however, there are third-party alternatives available for accessories for your Apple devices \u2013 namely there are reputable sellers like Anker, OtterBox, or Spigen. They sell cables, cases, batteries, speakers, etc. at a fraction of the cost Apple provides them,\u201d said Hall.\nPrice: Varies\nWhen you\u2019re at the Apple store and have bought a new product, you might be tempted to buy the case right then and there. You might want to think twice about that.\nSam Devia of eRepair said the cases for Apple devices are wastes of money.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the silicon and fine woven cases Apple sells are not worth it. For an absurd $50-$60, they offer little to no protection from fall damage, and wear pretty easily,\u201d said Devia.\nYou can also rely on third-party sellers to provide better cases for less cash.\nPrice: Varies\u00a0\nOne way to reduce the cost of your Apple products is to buy the model with the lowest storage capacity. However, Hall said you\u2019re better off splurging on a device with more storage.\n\u201cAs the data we consume and store grows in size, that baseline storage can become insufficient and fill fairly quickly,\u201d said Hall. \u201cIf you can invest in storage upgrades initially, we recommend you buy those instead of the base-line devices because Apple products can\u2019t be upgraded like PCs or Android phones. The reality is once you run out of space on your devices, you have only two options: (1) buy cloud storage or (2) upgrade the entire device.\u201d\nSo, investing in a device with more storage saves you money over time.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Bills You Never Have To Pay When You Retire\n6 Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From Buying\nHere's How to Add $200 to Your Wallet -- Just For Banking Like You Normally Would\nI Retired in My 70s: Here's My Monthly Budget\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Apple Products To Avoid Buying\n"

        "Text": "Apple AAPL is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $89.99 billion, indicating a decline of 5.11% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.51 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. However, the figure indicates a 0.66% decrease from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Apple has been one of the top performers in the past 12 months with consistent earnings performance. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.20% on average.However, Apple has been suffering from lower demand for the iPhone, a weak China market, stiff competition in the smartphone market and a worsening regulatory environment. These factors have hurt share price movement, which has declined 12.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 10.2%.\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\nApple\u2019s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 58.3% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales increased 6% year over year to $69.7 billion.The company expects the March quarter\u2019s (second-quarter fiscal 2024) iPhone revenues to be like that of the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.Our model estimates for fiscal second-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $46.99 billion, suggesting an 8.5% decline year over year. Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 53.3 million iPhones in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple\u2019s market share was 16% in the first quarter of calendar 2024, trailing Samsung\u2019s 20%.However, Apple\u2019s reported plan to integrate Gemini, Google\u2019s generative AI service, into iOS can be a gamechanger for iPhone shipments.\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit a worsening regulatory environment.Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $23.07 billion, indicating 10.3% year-over-year growth.\nPC segment witnessed growth in the first quarter of calendar 2024 after two years of decline. Per IDC\u2019s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo LNVGY topped the shipment list, trailed by HP HPQ and Dell Technologies DELL, in terms of market share.Lenovo, HP, Dell and Apple had 23%, 20.1%, 15.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Moreover, in terms of shipment, Lenovo and HP witnessed growth of 7.8% and 0.2%, respectively, while Dell Technologies lost 2.2%. Apple witnessed 14.6% growth, the strongest on the list.Nevertheless, Mac sales are expected to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Mac net sales is pegged at $6.03 billion, indicating a 15.9% year-over-year decline.\nApple\u2019s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weak iPhone and Mac sales as well as weakness in China. Regulatory headwind, including the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust lawsuit, is expected to remain an overhang on the shares.However, we believe the dip in Apple\u2019s share price presents a buying opportunity, and it would be wise to buy ahead of the second-quarter fiscal earnings. Integration of AI into iPhone, solid Apple TV+ content, expanding installed base and strong Services business are key catalysts.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Author": "  Associated Press ",
        "Text": "Apple is laying off more than 600 workers in California, marking the company's first big wave of post-pandemic job cuts amid a broader wave of tech industry consolidation.\nThe iPhone maker notified 614 workers in multiple offices on March 28 that they were losing their jobs, with the layoffs becoming effective on May 27, according to reports to regional authorities.\nThe workers were cut from eight offices in Santa Clara, according to the filings under the state's Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, also known as WARN. But it's not clear which departments or projects the employees were involved in.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.\nThe Cupertino, California, company had been a notable exception as other tech companies slashed their workforces over the past two years. There was a massive surge in hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people spent more time and money online, and big tech companies are still larger than they were before the pandemic. Still, as growth slows, companies are focusing on cutting costs.\nIn a recent regulatory filing, Apple said it had about 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nAmazon announced earlier this week a fresh round of layoffs, this time at its cloud computing business AWS. In recent months, video game maker Electronic Arts said it's cutting about 5% of its workforce, Sony said its axing about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division, Cisco Systems revealed plans to lay off more than 4,000 workers and social media company Snap, owner of Snapchat, announced its slashing 10% of its global workforce.\n"

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  James Brumley, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The past few weeks have been tough for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shareholders. The stock's now sitting 15% below its December high, sliding all the way back to where it was trading in late 2021. This is weakness that most investors just aren't accustomed to seeing from this frequent Wall Street favorite.\nIf you're interested in stepping into a new position in Apple, don't let the stock's recent performance rattle you. There are still good reasons to take on long-term trades in this consumer-technology titan. Here's a rundown of the best three.\nPerhaps the single-biggest reason Apple shares have stumbled of late is the company's recent performance in China. It's not been great. The nation just isn't evolving into the growth engine it was once expected to become.\nIndeed, after clawing its way to becoming the country's smartphone market-share leader last year (by virtue of losing less than its rivals), technology market research outfit IDC reports Apple's iPhone lost that lead again in the first quarter of this year. It's a microcosm of the company's struggle in the region.\nThe company is finally dealing with the challenge if only by turning its attention to more promising markets. That's southeast Asia and India, by the way. Earlier this month, CEO Tim Cook visited Singapore, committing $250 million to expand operations there. Apple's also investing heavily in India as a manufacturing partner as well as a market for its goods and services.\nBloomberg reports India assembled $14 billion worth of iPhones last fiscal year, with the country also seeing the opening of its first-ever Apple store in 2023. Counterpoint Research reports Apple is now leading India's smartphone market as measured by revenue, while analysts with Morgan Stanley say India alone could account for 15% of Apple's revenue growth over the course of the coming five years.\nIt's certainly a compelling start to weaning itself from China where doing business is proving increasingly tricky.\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken shape without much obvious involvement from Apple. But that's about to change. Without fleshing out any significant details, in February CEO Tim Cook said some AI-powered features of the company's next generation technology would be revealed at some point later this year.\nWhat sort of features? That's just it. He didn't say. Given the work the company's been doing, it's not a stretch to suggest that Apple's new A17 processor and the next iteration of its operating system (iOS 18) will likely allow iPhone owners to do generative AI work on their devices rather than in the cloud (where most generative AI tasks are actually handled right now). This of course has the potential to make Apple's onboard assistant Siri an even more powerful tool.\nAnd it matters. As Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani describes it, Apple's consumer-facing AI offerings could spark a \"supercycle\" of demand for the iPhone.It's not just its consumer-oriented features that will be improved by artificial intelligence. Apple's tech is also capable of doing things like optimizing ad placements and helping digital cameras (or augmented reality equipment) understand what an object or image is.\nAll told, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes Apple's AI offerings could -- just as a starting point -- add another $5 billion to the company's annual top line.\nWhile sales growth has been hit and miss lately, that hasn't prevented Apple from continuing to pump up its profits. The $100.9 billion worth of net income the company's produced over the course of the past four reported quarters is nearly a record, second only to the 12-month stretch ending in early 2022 (following the surge of smartphone purchases that had been put on hold during and because of the pandemic).\nWhat gives? Credit the growth of Apple's services business, mostly. Sales of apps and streaming content improved 11% year over year last quarter, but more than that, this revenue is very high margin. Roughly three-fourths of the company's services sales are converted into gross profit versus only 40% of product-driven revenue. The slow shift toward more service-oriented business is proving disproportionately lucrative. And this will likely remain the case for the indefinite future.\nThe ultimate end result is, of course, cash flow. And Apple's got plenty of that and can do a wide range of things with this cash, including bumping up its dividend, paying off debt, or acquiring complementary companies. Few other companies have such options.\nApple is also sitting on $73 billion worth of cash and cash-like instruments plus another $99 billion worth of marketable securities, by the way, bolstering its fiscal flexibility should it need it.\nReady to dive in? There's good reason to wait just a little bit longer. That is, the company's scheduled to release its fiscal Q2 numbers after the market closes on Thursday, May 2. This could result in volatility;\u00a0it might send the stock lower. We just don't know. For investors who can't stomach a rough start with a new position, missing out on a post-earnings pop is more palatable than riding out a post-earnings plunge.\nIf Apple shares do peel back following its Q2 results, that's absolutely a buying opportunity. This year's weakness from the stock already bakes in the worst-case scenario (and then some) without considering enough of the bullish initiatives the company is currently taking. The market may dish out one more knee-jerk reaction to any bearish spin in Q2's numbers.\nIf that's what ends up taking shape, however, it should actually flush out the last of the would-be sellers, leaving buyers behind for a while. That's, of course, your call to make. Just know that these timing-minded strategies usually don't matter much in the end for true long-term positions.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

We\u2019ve gotten through the big banks\u2019 results and a few quarterly releases from \u2018Mag 7\u2019 members, whose results didn\u2019t cause any meaningful spooks.\nAnd concerning this week\u2019s docket, investor favorite Apple AAPL is slated to unveil quarterly results. Shares have been considerably weak year-to-date, losing roughly 10% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 8% gain.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIs the stock a buy heading into earnings? Let\u2019s examine expectations and a few key metrics to watch in the release.\nApple \nApple\u2019s woes in 2024 have primarily been fueled by fears concerning slowing growth and weakening demand from China, with its quiet-natured approach to artificial intelligence (AI) also causing some head-scratching.\nShares faced pressure post-earnings following its latest release, with positivity surrounding its Services portfolio unable to excite the market. It\u2019s worth noting that revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion throughout the quarter, down 13% from the year-ago period.\nFor the quarter to be released, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in China stands at $16.6 billion, suggesting a 6.7% decrease from the year-ago period. As shown below, AAPL\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases, with the most recent miss totaling $2.5 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConcerning the Services portfolio, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $23.3 billion, 11.5% higher than the $20.9 billion reported in the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our Services expectations but modestly fell short in its latest release.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOf course, iPhone results will also be in focus. Our consensus estimate for iPhone sales stands at $46.2 billion, reflecting a nearly 10% pullback from the year-ago mark of $51.3 billion. The company snapped a streak of negative iPhone surprises in its latest release, with the beat totaling roughly $1 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalysts have modestly lowered their earnings expectations since the beginning of February, with the $1.51 per share estimate down 2.6% and essentially flat compared to the year-ago figure. Revenue revisions have moved in a similar fashion, as the $90 billion expected is down the same amount over the same period. \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nWe have many investor favorites on the reporting docket for this week, a list that includes tech heavyweight Apple AAPL.\nInvestors will be tuned into the company\u2019s China results, which have recently faced pressure amid rising competition. The Services portfolio will undoubtedly be another major highlight, an area of the company that\u2019s been a solid growth driver recently.\nHeading into the release, Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Sanghamitra Saha ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. AAPL has been an underperformer this year, with a year-to-date loss of 10.7%, underperforming other mega-cap technology companies. Its lesser exposure to AI within the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d group and concerns over the sales growth of iPhone in the key China market can be held responsible for this lackluster performance.\nPlus, rising rates have played a role in pushing the stock down in recent trading. Apple's stock recorded a 3.4% drop over the last five days. Apple is expected to come up with 2Q24 earnings results on May 2. Just prior to the earnings release, the stock is caught between bullish and bearish commentaries from Wall Street watchers.\nLet\u2019s delve a little deeper:\nBank of America named Apple a top pick for 2024, citing optimism over upcoming results and longer-term prospects. Analyst Wamsi Mohan, with a buy rating and $225 price target, highlighted Apple's \"rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows.\"\nBofA has positive expectations about Apple's second-quarter results, with expectations of strong services revenue growth and margins. However, the bank warned about a potential pullback in shares due to a weak demand environment.\nMorgan Stanley lowered its price target on the stock to $210 from $220 on Monday, expecting Apple to give a disappointing forecast when it reports. The firm suggests buying on post-earnings weakness, anticipating an upcoming Apple event focused on AI. Bloomberg Intelligence is still cautious, particularly regarding weaker iPhone demand in China.\nUBS Global Research also downgraded its rating on Apple with the other big five tech stocks. UBS downgraded because of tough comps and cyclical forces that hurt these stocks.\nThe company saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter. The iPhone maker has a decent track of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average beat of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.\nDespite Apple's prominence in benchmark equity indexes, Wall Street is fairly skeptical, with only 55% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommending the stock compared to higher percentages for other tech giants.\nHowever, some strategists find AAPL attractive given the stock's relatively cheaper valuation and potential benefits from a rotation to less rate-sensitive stocks amid high inflation and rising yields.\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations.\nOf the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.14% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $205.24. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00. The average price target represents an increase of 24.39% from the last closing price of $165.00.\nInvestors intending to follow bullish comments from Wall Street analysts but still wary of slowing sales of Apple may take the ETF route. This is because ETFs help investors mitigate one company\u2019s average performance with the other big tech companies\u2019 stellar presence.\nBelow, we highlight a few ETFs with heavy exposure to Apple for investors seeking to bet on the stock with much lower risk.\nSelect Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK \u2013 AAPL holds the second spot with 19.10% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nVanguard Information Technology ETF VGT \u2013 AAPL occupies the second location with 16.39% weight.

Counterpoint Research reports Apple is now leading India's smartphone market as measured by revenue, while analysts with Morgan Stanley say India alone could account for 15% of Apple's revenue growth over the course of the coming five years.\nIt's certainly a compelling start to weaning itself from China where doing business is proving increasingly tricky.\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken shape without much obvious involvement from Apple. But that's about to change. Without fleshing out any significant details, in February CEO Tim Cook said some AI-powered features of the company's next generation technology would be revealed at some point later this year.\nWhat sort of features? That's just it. He didn't say. Given the work the company's been doing, it's not a stretch to suggest that Apple's new A17 processor and the next iteration of its operating system (iOS 18) will likely allow iPhone owners to do generative AI work on their devices rather than in the cloud (where most generative AI tasks are actually handled right now). This of course has the potential to make Apple's onboard assistant Siri an even more powerful tool.\nAnd it matters. As Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani describes it, Apple's consumer-facing AI offerings could spark a \"supercycle\" of demand for the iPhone.It's not just its consumer-oriented features that will be improved by artificial intelligence. Apple's tech is also capable of doing things like optimizing ad placements and helping digital cameras (or augmented reality equipment) understand what an object or image is.\nAll told, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes Apple's AI offerings could -- just as a starting point -- add another $5 billion to the company's annual top line.\nWhile sales growth has been hit and miss lately, that hasn't prevented Apple from continuing to pump up its profits. The $100.9 billion worth of net income the company's produced over the course of the past four reported quarters is nearly a record, second only to the 12-month stretch ending in early 2022 (following the surge of smartphone purchases that had been put on hold during and because of the pandemic).\nWhat gives? Credit the growth of Apple's services business, mostly. Sales of apps and streaming content improved 11% year over year last quarter, but more than that, this revenue is very high margin. Roughly three-fourths of the company's services sales are converted into gross profit versus only 40% of product-driven revenue. The slow shift toward more service-oriented business is proving disproportionately lucrative. And this will likely remain the case for the indefinite future.\nThe ultimate end result is, of course, cash flow. And Apple's got plenty of that and can do a wide range of things with this cash, including bumping up its dividend, paying off debt, or acquiring complementary companies. Few other companies have such options.\nApple is also sitting on $73 billion worth of cash and cash-like instruments plus another $99 billion worth of marketable securities, by the way, bolstering its fiscal flexibility should it need it.\nReady to dive in? There's good reason to wait just a little bit longer. That is, the company's scheduled to release its fiscal Q2 numbers after the market closes on Thursday, May 2. This could result in volatility;\u00a0it might send the stock lower. We just don't know. For investors who can't stomach a rough start with a new position, missing out on a post-earnings pop is more palatable than riding out a post-earnings plunge.\nIf Apple shares do peel back following its Q2 results, that's absolutely a buying opportunity. This year's weakness from the stock already bakes in the worst-case scenario (and then some) without considering enough of the bullish initiatives the company is currently taking. The market may dish out one more knee-jerk reaction to any bearish spin in Q2's numbers.\nIf that's what ends up taking shape, however, it should actually flush out the last of the would-be sellers, leaving buyers behind for a while. That's, of course, your call to make. Just know that these timing-minded strategies usually don't matter much in the end for true long-term positions.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Apple's smartphone shipments dropped about 10% in the first quarter of 2024, hurt by intensifying competition by Android smartphone makers aiming for the top spot, data from research firm IDC showed on Sunday.\nGlobal smartphone shipments increased 7.8% to 289.4 million units during January-March, with Samsung, at 20.8% market share, clinching the top phonemaker spot from Apple.\nThe iPhone-maker's steep sales decline comes after its strong performance in the December quarter when it overtook Samsung as the world's No.1 phone maker. It's back to the second spot, with 17.3% market share, as Chinese brands such as Huawei gain market share.\nXiaomi, one of China's top smartphone makers, occupied the third position with a market share of 14.1% during the first quarter.\nSouth Korea's Samsung, which launched its latest flagship smartphone lineup - Galaxy S24 series - in the beginning of the year, shipped more than 60 million phones during the period.\nGlobal sales of Galaxy S24 smartphones jumped 8%, compared to last year's Galaxy S23 series during their first three weeks of availability, data provider Counterpoint previously said.\nIn the first quarter, Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones, down from 55.4 million units it shipped same period last year, according to IDC.\nApple's smartphone shipments in China shrank 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023 from a year earlier.\nThe drop underscores the challenges facing the U.S. firm in its third biggest market, as some Chinese companies and government agencies limit employees' use of Apple devices, a measure that mirrors U.S. government restrictions on Chinese apps on security grounds.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company in June will hold its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where it will highlight updates to the software powering iPhones, iPads, and other Apple devices.\nInvestors are closely watching for updates on artificial intelligence development at Apple, which has so far spoken little about incorporating the AI technology into its devices.

        "Text": "Consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. announces its latest financial results post-market Thursday amid various headwinds, including missed growth expectations, increased competition and increasing perceptions that it is not as innovative as it once was.\nAPPL stock rose 3% on Monday amid investor hopes that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company would build on the same artificial intelligence momentum that has recently swept Microsoft and other tech firms upward. But AAPL\u00a0is down nearly 12% for the year.\nThis poor performance has been a drag on many tech-focused exchange-traded funds this year. For example, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) started the week up a modest 4.4% year-to-date, which lagged the 7.3% gain on the SPDR S&P ETF Trust (SPY).\nApple, Inc. (AAPL) stock is down in 2024 for many reasons. Here's a breakdown of some potential factors that some analysts say are contributing to the stock price decline:\nMissed growth expectations: While Apple maintains a massive installed user base, its product sales, particularly iPhones, were down 19% in the first three months of 2024. This has led to investor disappointment and a decline in stock price.\nCompetition: Renewed competition from Huawei, particularly in the Chinese market, is putting pressure on Apple's smartphone dominance. Huawei's resurgence with its advanced 5G technology disrupts Apple's market share, especially in a critical country like China.\nInnovation shortfall: Apple is battling a rising perception among investors that Apple hasn't delivered groundbreaking innovations recently. Compared to previous years with product launches like the Apple Watch or AirPods, there\u00a0is a lack of excitement surrounding newer offerings, leading to a less bullish outlook.\nTech sector slowdown: The technology sector hasn't performed as well as some other sectors in 2024. This broader slowdown might be affecting AAPL stock along with other tech giants.\nValuation concerns: Apple's stock price might have reached a point where some investors believe it's overvalued compared to its current growth prospects. The AAPL price-earnings ratio is approximately 26, which is not extreme, but is slightly above the 20-25 average range for growth stocks.\nTicker\nFund\nExpense Ratio\nAUM\nAAPL Allocation\nVGT\nVanguard Information Technology ETF\n0.10%\n$62.6B\n21.5%\nXLK\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund\n0.09%\n$61.9B\n19.9%\nFTEC\nFidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF\n0.08%\n$9.2B\n19.6%\nIXN\niShares Global Tech ETF\n0.41%\n$4.2B\n18.1%\nIYW\niShares U.S. Technology ETF\n0.40%\n$15.7B\n15.2%\nData as of April 25, 2024.

Here's a breakdown of what analysts are saying:\nAverage price target: As of April 29, 2024, analyst consensus suggests an average price target for AAPL in the range of $200 to $207 per share, according to TipRanks. This represents a potential upside of roughly 15-20% from its most recent price of about $174.\nVaried opinions: While the average price target indicates potential growth, individual analyst forecasts can vary significantly. Some analysts might be more bullish, predicting higher price points, while others might be more cautious with lower targets.\nFocus on revenue and earnings: Analyst forecasts often consider factors like projected revenue, earnings per share (EPS), and overall company performance. Apple's recent sales figures, particularly in China, might be leading some analysts to revise their forecasts downward.\nWhile Apple's stock is down year-to-date in 2024, it's important to consider its long-term performance and remember that the overall stock market can be volatile in the short term as economic conditions fluctuate.\nIt's always wise to conduct your own research and consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before making investment decisions.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

In August, China asked all mobile app developers to register with the government by the end of March, or cease operating.\nBeijing has barred the use of foreign messaging and social media platforms like WhatsApp for years, using what the industry calls the Great Firewall.

That put it almost level with Huawei, which saw sales jump 70%, according to research firm Counterpoint.\nApple lost its crown as the biggest smartphone seller in China to rival Vivo, sliding to third place in the quarter, followed by Huawei whose market share jumped to 15.5% from 9.3% a year earlier. Honor, a mass market brand spun out of Huawei, was in second place.\n\"Huawei\u2019s comeback has directly impacted Apple in the premium segment. Besides, the replacement demand for Apple has been slightly subdued compared to previous years,\" said Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam in a press release.\n\"For the second quarter, the possibility of new color options combined with aggressive sales initiatives could bring the brand back into positive territory,\" Lam said, adding it is seeing slow but steady improvement in weekly iPhone sales.\nChina is Apple's third-biggest market and generated around 17% of its total revenue in the October-December quarter.\nIts market share loss in China comes after separate data showed earlier this month that the U.S. firm suffered nearly a 10% drop in global smartphone shipments in the first quarter of 2024, hurt by intensifying competition by Android smartphone makers led by Samsung Electronics.\nSamsung clinched the top phonemaker spot from Apple in the first quarter.\nShares of Apple slipped 0.4% in premarket trade on Tuesday. The stock has fallen about 14% so far this year and posted its worst weekly performance in over eight months on Friday.\nThroughout the first quarter, Apple launched campaigns in China to entice consumers with discounts, including subsidizing certain iPhone models by as much as 1,300 yuan ($180).\nHuawei last week released its Pura 70 series of high-end phones after launching the Mate 60 series in August. The Mate 60 was seen as a comeback for the Chinese firm in the high-end market and described as a triumph over U.S. sanctions on the company, as the handsets contain an advanced China-made chip.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Sunday that the chip powering Huawei's flagship phone is not as advanced as American chips, arguing it showed U.S. curbs on shipments to the telecoms equipment giant are working.\nCanadian research firm TechInsights expects overall shipments in China this year to top 50 million units, including 10 million for the Pura 70 series.

        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "On April 11, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock popped 4.3% in a single session, the largest jump in nearly a year. However, the stock gave back some of those gains in the following sessions due to a broader market pullback and reports of lower iPhone shipments.\nHere's a breakdown of what's moving Apple stock, where the investment thesis stands, and whether the stock is worth buying now.\nApple has been noticeably absent from the broader tech stock, growth stock, and artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled market rally. In fact, Apple stock lost value in 2024 and has drastically underperformed the S&P 500 over the last year.\nThere are plenty of valid reasons for Apple's underperformance. The primary issue is that Apple's earnings have stalled and growth has ground to a halt.\nThe company has failed to make a splash in AI, while other big tech companies have been able to measure AI's impact on their bottom lines and chart a multiyear runaway toward further AI-fueled growth. Apple's AI and virtual reality investments, like the Vision Pro, are still in their early stages and haven't had a material impact on the company's performance just yet.\nHowever, investors got a much-needed vote of confidence on April 11 when reports surfaced that Apple was nearing the production of computer processors with AI capabilities.\nAI chips have been a major catalyst for semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices and could help rejuvenate interest in consumer electronics. The COVID-19 pandemic pulled forward demand for Apple's products, which boosted short-term results but led to sluggish growth in recent years. Apple needs a defining product characteristic for the next upgrade cycle since marginal product improvements haven't been enough to spur demand meaningfully. Embedding more AI capabilities into the iPhone would be the natural way to help Apple return to growth.\nAs for now, Apple remains stuck in a demand slump. International Data Group (IDC) reported that Apple's iPhone shipments fell nearly 10% in the first quarter of 2024. Apple has so far been able to offset slower demand out of China with rising or flat demand in North America and emerging markets.\nInvestors will have to wait until May 2 to hear from Apple about its exact second-quarter fiscal 2024 figures. However, the IDC report is concerning and illustrates the importance of Apple's product improvements. Apple must convince investors that next-generation products will sell because they are better, not just because consumers are due for an upgrade.\nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference from June 10 to June 14 and its annual new product unveiling event in September are the two marquee events this year. These events are good opportunities for Apple to flex its innovation. But if Apple disappoints, they could also accelerate downward pressure on the stock.\nApple stock has been noticeably more volatile lately. In late March, the stock suffered its largest single-session drop in over seven months, followed by its largest single-session gain in over 11 months just a few weeks later. Apple's brand and market positioning need no introduction, but its growth is in question, especially as consumers remain strained.\nWith the growth narrative out the window, at least for now, Apple is starting to look more like a value stock. It is the cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in terms of price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios. It even trades at a discount to the S&P 500.\nApple isn't dirt cheap, but it doesn't fetch nearly the premium as its behemoth tech peers. Investors who are confident Apple can turn things around are getting the chance to buy the stock for a good price. However, it's important to understand that Apple has fallen for mostly good reasons and that it could fall further with a broader market sell-off.\nBuying Apple now shouldn't be a bet on the stock suddenly staging an epic turnaround, but rather a long-term investment in an excellent company that will monetize AI and has a long runway for returning value to shareholders and growing over time.\nIt's worth noting that even amid slowing growth, Apple generates plenty of extra cash to continue to buy back a boatload of stock and raise its dividend. Apple is a buy for patient investors, but the stock could face pressure if its AI investments fail to deliver.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Mike Scarcella\n(Reuters) - IPhone maker Apple on Friday denied violating a court order governing its App Store and urged a California federal judge to reject a request by \u201cFortnite\u201d developer Epic Games to hold it in contempt.\nApple made the arguments in a filing to U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, who presided over Epic\u2019s lawsuit in 2020 accusing Apple of violating antitrust law with its tight controls over how consumers download apps and pay for transactions within them.\nThe Apple filing criticized what it called an attempt by Epic to make Apple's \"tools and technologies available to developers for free.\"\nEpic, it said, wanted the court \"to micromanage Apple\u2019s business operations in a way that would increase Epic\u2019s profitability.\"\nEpic declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the dispute, part of a long fight between the two companies.\nEpic largely lost its case against Apple, but Rogers in 2021 ordered Apple to give developers greater freedom to guide app users to alternative payment methods for digital goods.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in January declined to hear Apple's appeal of the injunction order.\nEpic said in a court filing last month that Cupertino, California-based Apple was in \u201cblatant violation\u201d of the court\u2019s injunction. It pointed to Apple\u2019s imposition of a 27% fee on developers for some purchases, which the video game maker said makes links for alternative payment options \"commercially unusable.\"\nEpic also alleged Apple barred some apps from informing users about other ways to pay for goods.\nMeta Platforms, Microsoft, Elon Musk\u2019s X and Match Group last month echoed Epic\u2019s arguments, telling Rogers that Apple was in \u201cclear violation\u201d of the court\u2019s order.\nIn a similar case that Epic brought against Alphabet's Google, a judge in San Francisco is expected this year to issue a separate injunction affecting the Google Play Store.\nThe case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-05640.\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella, Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Text": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Apple said it had removed Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging app and its Threads social media app from the App Store in China to comply with orders from Chinese authorities.\nThe apps were removed from the store on Friday after Chinese officials cited unspecified national security concerns.\nTheir removal comes amid elevated tensions between the U.S. and China over trade, technology and national security.\nThe U.S. has threatened to ban TikTok over national security concerns. But while TikTok, owned by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, is used by millions in the U.S., apps like WhatsApp and Threads are not commonly used in China.\nInstead, the messaging app WeChat, owned by Chinese company Tencent, reigns supreme.\nOther Meta apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger remained available for download, although use of such foreign apps is blocked in China due to its \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d network of filters that restrict use of foreign websites such as Google and Facebook.\n\u201cThe Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,\u201d Apple said.\nA spokesman for Meta referred to \u201cApple for comment.\u201d\nApple, previously the world\u2019s top smartphone maker, recently lost the top spot to Korean rival Samsung Electronics. The U.S. firm has run into headwinds in China, one of its top three markets, with sales slumping after Chinese government agencies and employees of state-owned companies were ordered not to bring Apple devices to work.\nApple has been diversifying its manufacturing bases outside China.\nIts CEO Tim Cook has been visiting Southeast Asia this week, traveling to Hanoi and Jakarta before wrapping up his travels in Singapore. On Friday he met with Singapore\u2019s deputy prime minister, Lawrence Wong, where they \u201cdiscussed the partnership between Singapore and Apple, and Apple\u2019s continued commitment to doing business in Singapore.\u201d\nApple pledged to invest over $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state.\nEarlier this week, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, pledging to increase spending on Vietnamese suppliers.\nHe also met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Cook later told reporters that they talked about Widodo's desire to promote manufacturing in Indonesia, and said that this was something that Apple would \u201clook at\".\n"

It was not clear if other governments have also raised similar concerns\nApple and the Indian government did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\nMercenary spyware attacks are rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or malware, according to the notification email.\nApple has sent threat notifications such as these multiple times in a year since 2021, the notification email said, adding that it had notified users in more than 150 countries in total to date.\n(Reporting by Ashna Teresa Britto; Editing by Janane Venkatraman, Miyoung Kim and Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Text": "Apple is reportedly doubling down on live sports through a first-of-its-kind agreement with global soccer governing body FIFA that would give it the worldwide television rights for a new tournament.\nThe TV deal could be announced as soon as this month, with the tournament set to be held in the U.S. next summer, reported the New York Times, citing three people familiar with the matter.\nThe agreement with Apple would be unique for FIFA, which usually strikes deals with several TV providers in different countries for global tournaments such as the World Cup.\nBy contrast, the Apple deal may reportedly omit free-to-air-rights, which could make the tournament available to Apple TV+ subscribers only\u2014a point that has raised concern among some FIFA senior executives, according to the Times.\n\"As a general practice, FIFA does not confirm or deny commercial discussions,\" a FIFA spokesperson told Fortune.\nApple struck a similarly exclusive 10-year deal to secure the streaming rights for Major League Soccer at a $2.5 billion price tag last year. The agreement, which Apple dubbed MLS Season Pass, was prescient for the tech company. Subscriptions to Apple TV+ jumped by more than 100,000 in one day, compared to around 6,000 the day before, after World Cup winner Lionel Messi played his first game with MLS Club Inter Miami CF in June, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nAlthough Apple does not break out revenue for Apple TV+, the services business segment it belongs to netted the company $85.2 billion in net sales in 2023, up 9% from $78.1 billion the prior year, according to the company\u2019s most recent 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe competition for live sports has heated up recently as streaming companies look to live sports to grow. Peacock streamed its third exclusive National Football League game in March and Amazon Prime just completed its second year of a $1 billion-per-season deal to stream the NFL\u2019s Thursday Night Football programming. Apple has recently increased its interest in live sports deals as well.\nThe tech company is competing with other streamers such as Amazon Prime Video, Google\u2019s YouTube, and Netflix to secure the rights to some NBA games, the Athletic reported Monday. Apple also struck a streaming rights deal with Major League baseball in 2022.\nThe new World Cup-style tournament, which FIFA previously said would be called the Mundial de Clubes FIFA (although that name is reportedly under review), will include 32 teams. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has long pushed for the competition that would pit some of the world\u2019s best soccer clubs against each other every four years. Powerhouse clubs such as FC Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain FC, and Serie A champions Inter Milan are already qualified to participate, according to FIFA.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

That tension is coming to the fore as the import hurdles have ignited furor among top executives at companies from Apple to Michelin and spurred business chambers from the US to South Korea to write letters to his government to review the matter, said the people who asked not to be named discussing sensitive issues.\nRepresentatives from Apple as well as Indonesia\u2019s ministries of trade and industry didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nMichelin said it has been working with associations and other companies facing a similar issue, and it\u2019s optimistic the government will act soon to fix the problem. \u201cMichelin aims at integrating Indonesia fully into its global value chain, and that is why openness to trade is key to us,\u201d it said in an emailed response to Bloomberg.\nThe complex rule effectively restricts imports of about 4,000 products, including finished goods such as laptops and raw materials like hazardous chemicals. To get import permits, companies must get a letter of recommendation from the Ministry of Industry, but the process is onerous \u2014 requiring firms to submit tenancy agreements and annual forecasts of items they intend to bring into the country, said the people.\nThe forecasts may be used by the government to set import quotas for certain products, which the companies view as being meant to spur them to set up production facilities onshore to get an upper hand or lose out to rivals because of the quota mechanism, they said.\nDespite multiple queries from the companies, the government didn\u2019t give any clarity on the implementation since the rule was signed into law in December, the people said. Firms only understood the complexity and ramifications once the regulation was enforced, which is throwing companies into turmoil as they need to plan budgets, logistics and transport for the goods, they said.\nFirms are now turning to Coordinating Investment and Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Panjaitan, who\u2019s seen as someone who has Jokowi\u2019s ear, to persuade the president to ease the rule. In private conversations, Panjaitan described the rule as potentially injuring Indonesia\u2019s business reputation and economic interests, the people said.\nA representative for Panjaitan didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n--With assistance from Eddie Spence and Eko Listiyorini.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook toured Southeast Asia last week, visiting Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, as part of a multiday trip geared toward reducing Apple\u2019s reliance on China as its central manufacturing hub.\nAnd while Apple isn\u2019t looking to abandon China \u2014 Cook spent a number of days in the country just last month \u2014 the company is hedging against the potential for future manufacturing roadblocks in the region.\nAt the same time, the company is slowly setting its sights on India as its next major growth opportunity now that China has become a more mature smartphone market.\n\u201cApple is in the beginning stages of a decade[-long] transition away from reliance on China and diversify that to other countries in Southeast Asia on both the manufacturing front and the demand front,\u201d Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\nBut reducing Apple\u2019s dependence on China for building its devices and growing its market share could take some time.\nChina accounts for a disproportionate amount of Apple\u2019s supply chain partners such as Foxconn and Pegatron. That concentration of manufacturing capacity in one area proved especially damaging during the pandemic when China forced factories to shut down, limiting Apple\u2019s ability to build and ship devices.\nOnce capacity came back online, Apple was able to meet consumer demand again. But the fact that a factory closure had such an impact on the company was a troubling sign of fragility in its supply chain.\n\u201cApple basically said they fulfilled about $5 billion of back revenue on the last conference call,\u201d BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThat's $5 billion for one facility shut down in China.\u201d\nLeft unchecked, that lack of supply chain resiliency could come back to bite Apple again given the gloomy state of the US and China\u2019s relationship and tit-for-tat maneuvers the countries are making with regard to their respective tech companies. The US has tried to box out Huawei from getting access to high-end processors and is working to get ByteDance to sell TikTok, while China is reportedly requiring state employees to ditch devices made by Western companies.\n\u201cWe see Cupertino going aggressively after [Southeast Asian] countries on the supply front,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. \u201cCook is hedging his bets as China remains a very dicey situation for Apple while Vietnam and Indonesia are soft landing spots for iPhone production.\u201d\nApple\u2019s problems in China extend beyond manufacturing complexities. The company is also contending with a slowdown in iPhone sales in the region as economic growth flags and regional rivals grab market share.\nGreater China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market by revenue behind the Americas and Europe. But iPhone sales in the region are slowing. In Q1, Apple reported revenue in Greater China fell 13% year over year, and that\u2019s after falling 2% for all of 2023. Apple previously reported 9% growth in the region in 2022.\nChina is also a relatively mature smartphone market, making massive growth gains a difficult proposition, which is where India comes in.\nThe most populous country in the world, India has a growing middle class that could prove to be a boon for Apple.\n\u201cChina took probably five years before it really mattered,\u201d Munster explained. \u201cIndia probably takes 10 years, and the reason is they've got the population on their side, but the GDP per capita is about a quarter in India what it is in China. And so just in general, people don't have \u2026 the same wealth in India as they do in China.\u201d\nApple opened its first official store in India last year, with Cook himself kicking off the festivities for the Mumbai location. Apple also builds some of its latest iPhones in the country, making it even more important for the company.\nEmerging markets like India are going to be key to Apple\u2019s growth in the coming years, as its larger markets continue to mature and growth declines. The company has been telegraphing that much as well. In earnings calls, executives repeatedly point to emerging markets as growth areas during earnings calls, with Tim Cook specifically pointing to the likes of India and other growth markets in his opening remarks during Apple\u2019s Q1 call.\nStill, Apple\u2019s push to expand its manufacturing and market share outside of China will take years. So, for the foreseeable future, the company will have to continue to rely on China and figure out how to make the best of it.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Most investors focus on a company's growth prospects when considering a purchase of its stock. And understandably so. Revenue and earnings growth isn't the only way to add to a stock's value, however.\nReducing the number of outstanding shares of a company is another, often-overlooked means of making existing shareholders' stakes worth more. The company in question simply needs to repurchase shares of itself in the open market and then take them out of circulation.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been one of the more prominent names embracing this idea. Although it pays a dividend, it's opting to reward investors by buying shares of itself rather than raising its dividend payouts. Over the course of the past four reported quarters, Apple has shelled out $78.1 billion to repurchase 456 million shares of its own stock. For perspective, Apple's current market capitalization stands at $2.6 trillion, and it's got nearly 15.58 billion outstanding shares.\nOK, the stock repurchase program isn't exactly making a huge dent in shareholders' favor. Keep things in perspective, though. This is an enormous company. It's going to take a lot to make a beneficial difference in its float. Given what's feasible, Apple's buyback program is actually quite impressive.\nIt's also worth pointing out that the company continues to make overall net progress in terms of reducing the supply of shares in its effort to make its remaining ones more valuable. Unlike too many other corporations, this one isn't issuing new stock just as quickly as it's repurchasing and retiring existing shares. As of the end of last year, there were about 2% fewer outstanding Apple shares than there were a year earlier.\nIs the company's stock buyback program a reason in and of itself to purchase Apple stock? No. The consistent net repurchases of its own shares, however, certainly bolsters the bullish argument for owning Apple stock. The thing is, even if Apple were a net issuer of new shares of itself, it would still be a great investment.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The companies own two of the most valuable brands on the planet, helping them command huge profit margin advantages over their peers. And they are cash-generating machines, which gives their management teams extra resources they can direct toward stock buybacks and a growing dividend payment.\nCoca-Cola and Apple are both favorites of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, too.\nWith those similarities in mind, let's stack the two companies up against each other as dividend investments.\nApple and Coca-Cola generate similar profit margins that reflect their premium industry positions. Coke's 30% operating profitability is about double PepsiCo's result. Apple, meanwhile, earns 10 percentage points more than peers like Garmin who compete in the tech device space.\nApple has a much better shot at improving on this metric over the coming years. Some of its fastest growth is occurring in the services segment, which includes subscription products like its streaming music platform. As the business tilts in that direction, investors are looking for Apple's margins to move toward more software-focused tech giants like Microsoft and its 40%-plus margin.\nCoke shareholders can expect more modest margin expansion in the coming years due to the maturity of its industry. The beverage giant will get help from its push into more premium products like energy drinks and alcoholic beverages. Yet its earnings growth options are limited.\nCoke is the clear winner when it comes to instant income. You'll get a 3%-plus yield from this stock, which is more than double the yield you'd get from owning the S&P 500 through an index fund. It's easily one of the biggest yields in the consumer staples industry as well.\nApple stock pays a relatively paltry 0.6% yield, in contrast. That's enough to put the iPhone maker above other members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" though, except for Microsoft.\nCash flow is solid at both companies, but Apple easily wins this matchup. The tech giant is generating more than $100 billion of free cash flow annually compared to Coke's $10 billion. Most of those excess resources are going toward attractive growth investments like product innovation.\nApple is also spending aggressively on stock buybacks. But at some point in the future, the tech titan will be free to shift its capital returns more toward dividend payments.\nShares of Coke and Apple have underperformed the market in recent months, making them relative bargains compared to their peers. As a dividend investor, your choice between the two will mostly come down to your preference between growth and stability.\nCoke offers one of the most dependable dividends in the market, a payout that's risen in each of the last 61 years. The company's sales are highly stable as well and don't tend to fall hard even during recessions. And you'll get a much higher yield from owning the beverage stock today.\nIn exchange for less stability and a smaller starting yield, Apple stock delivers some tantalizing advantages, mostly in the form of growth opportunities. Its dividend has more than doubled in the past decade, and the tech giant's gushing cash flow and improving margins suggest it could maintain that fantastic growth pace in the years ahead.\nWhile Coke checks more boxes for dividend investors, consider Apple for its potential to mature into a fantastic income investment in the future.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are down 13% year to date. The company is facing several headwinds right now, including weak iPhone sales in China and increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe.\nDespite these headwinds, Wells Fargo has an overweight (buy) rating on the shares with a $225 price target. That's 35% higher than Apple's current share price of $166.90.\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30, 2023), iPhone sales grew in every region except China. But analysts expect Apple to report a 5% year-over-year decline in revenue for the fiscal second quarter.\nApple is expected to launch generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for iOS later this year, which could stimulate iPhone demand, but investors are worried about the cost of these new features. Analysts expect Apple to post earnings per share of $1.50 for fiscal Q2, slightly down from $1.52 in the year-ago period.\nAnother cloud hanging over Apple stock right now is regulation. In March, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit alleging that Apple is monopolizing the smartphone market with certain contractual restrictions placed on app developers. Meanwhile, the European Union is trying to force Apple to offer users alternative ways to buy content in the App Store.\nOverall, these headwinds may continue to negatively impact investor sentiment around the stock in the near term, but these issues don't impact the value of Apple's brand.\nThe stock's valuation still isn't cheap on a price-to-earnings basis, and with Apple likely facing another quarter of soft iPhone sales, investors shouldn't expect the stock to reach the analyst's price target anytime soon. However, stronger iPhone sales in calendar 2025, especially if Apple releases new AI features, may be the catalyst that sends the share price higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?",
        "Author": "  Kevin Vandenboss ",
        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), now the world\u2019s second most valuable company, has had a challenging year so far in 2024. The tech giant has lost significant market share in China to domestic rival Huawei, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker, accusing it of creating a monopoly over the smartphone market and engaging in anti-competitive practices. To make matters worse, Apple announced earlier this month that it would lay off 614 employees in California, according to eight reports filed with the California Employment Development Department.\nThese developments have led some investors to question the stability of their investments in Apple, particularly in light of the fact that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) sold nearly $2 billion worth of its Apple shares during the 4th quarter of 2023. This begs the question: What would happen if Warren Buffett decided to completely divest Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Apple?\nIt\u2019s important to note that there is no indication that Buffett plans to sell any of Berkshire\u2019s Apple shares, let alone all of them. In fact, during the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting last year, Buffett praised Apple, calling it \u201ca better business than any we own.\u201d However, for the sake of speculation, let\u2019s explore the potential impact of such a move.\nAs of the latest filings, Berkshire Hathaway owns 905,560,000 shares of Apple, representing a significant portion of the tech company\u2019s 15.44 billion outstanding shares. If Buffett were to sell all of these shares, it could potentially flood the market with excess supply, putting downward pressure on Apple\u2019s stock price.\nGiven that Apple\u2019s average daily trading volume is around 61.6 million shares, it would take approximately 15 trading days for the market to absorb Berkshire\u2019s entire stake, assuming no other factors influenced the stock\u2019s trading activity. During this hypothetical sell-off, Apple\u2019s shares, which are already down 9.3% year-to-date, could experience further decline.\nThe psychological impact of Buffett\u2019s complete divestment could also be significant. Many investors look to Buffett as a beacon of long-term, value-oriented investing. If he were to lose faith in Apple, it could shake investor confidence and lead to a broader sell-off in the stock.\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that Apple is still a fundamentally strong company with a loyal customer base and a history of innovation. Despite the challenges it faces, analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus price target of $196.77, representing a potential 17.51% upside from current levels.\nThe truth is, no matter how strong a company may be, factors beyond its control \u2013 such as market sentiment, regulatory pressures, and competition \u2013 can significantly impact its stock price. This underscores the importance of diversification in an investor\u2019s portfolio.\nFor investors seeking to mitigate the risks associated with stock market volatility, alternative investments like real estate can provide a valuable diversification opportunity. Platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer unique ways to invest in real estate without the need to purchase and manage properties directly.\nArrived allows investors to buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing exposure to the potential appreciation and rental income of the underlying properties. With an average dividend yield of 4.2% and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\nClick here to see properties available to invest in today with as little as $100\nSimilarly, Cityfunds provides a way for investors to gain exposure to specific real estate markets through its city-specific funds. For example, you could own shares of a diversified portfolio of home equity investments in Miami, which have already seen a 14.7% increase in value.\nThere's also the Cityfunds Yield fund, which targets an 8% annual yield, with a guaranteed 7% floor, by investing in a diversified pool of collateralized real estate loans.\nClick here to explore the Cityfunds available to invest in today with as little as $500.\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that Warren Buffett will completely divest Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Apple, the hypothetical scenario serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in any single stock investment. By diversifying into alternative assets like real estate, investors can potentially reduce their exposure to market volatility and build a more resilient portfolio.\nAs always, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions. But for those looking to expand their investment horizons, platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer compelling opportunities to invest in real estate without the headaches of traditional property ownership.\nThis article What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "And the hits to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock just keep on coming. On Monday, investment bank Morgan Stanley was the latest to warn that all is not well in Cupertino.\nCutting Apple stock's price target from $220 to $210, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring predicted that when the company reports second-quarter earnings next week, it will beat expectations for both sales and earnings. That's the good news. The bad news is that Apple will probably guide 4% below Wall Street predictions.\nAnd that could cause a sell-off.\nWhy does Woodring think this? China is one reason. Apple gets 19% of its revenue from China, but iPhone sales are skidding over there, and that's going to hurt both Apple's revenue and profits. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another reason. Apple hasn't announced a great generative AI product of its own, and had to ask Google for help with that. These factors could force Apple to downplay third-quarter expectations in its report.\nIt's worth noting: Woodring doesn't think this is a reason to sell Apple stock. On the contrary, he rates Apple overweight and thinks you should buy it eventually. If Q2 earnings spark a sell-off, but Apple later announces exciting new AI functionality in its new iPhones -- perhaps at the Worldwide Developer Conference in June -- this could create a stock-boosting short squeeze in Apple shares.\nHence his advice: Wait for earnings. Wait for the sell-off. And then buy Apple stock.\nIs this good advice?\nI've said it before and I'll say it again: At 26 times earnings, and with free cash flow recently falling below reported net income, Apple is not a cheap stock. Furthermore, few analysts think a giant like Apple will be able to grow its earnings quickly -- no more than maybe 10% per year over the next five years. That works out to a fairly lofty PEG ratio of 2.5.\nBased on these numbers, I don't think Apple stock is a buy today.

The Bernstein analyst had recommended investors just hold shares in the iPhone maker. Now, ahead of its quarterly earnings report expected later this week, Sacconaghi says it's time to buy Apple stock.\nThe analyst's \"outperform\" rating comes with a price target of $195 for Apple. That's a gain of nearly 15% over the next 12 months from Tuesday's closing price.\nApple hasn't been a standout among technology stocks this year. Shares are down nearly 12% year to date. That has come about as investors fear growth is slowing and interest in its latest iPhone offering has been lackluster.\nBut the Bernstein analyst says that's exactly why investors should now \"buy the fear\" in Apple. Sacconaghi thinks weakness in the large Chinese market is just part of the product cycle and is not structural in nature. And that fear has also led to low expectations from Apple with its fiscal second-quarter results due to be reported on Thursday, May 2.\nBut investors shouldn't worry about whether Apple stock pops or drops when it reports quarterly earnings. The stock should be owned based on its financial and business fundamentals. One reason is that regardless of the short-term stock movement, investors will be rewarded with a dividend payment. Other popular big tech companies Meta Platforms and Alphabet recently initiated dividends. But Apple has been paying shareholders over the past decade. And with more than $170 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet as of Dec. 30, 2023, there's little danger of a cut in the dividend.\nEven if the stock drops after earnings, the long-term picture still looks bright. Apple will inevitably continue to release new products and services.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock is in a funk. Late to the artificial intelligence game, Apple recently had to iPhone Google for assistance. The latest data on iPhone sales is disheartening -- shipments are down 37% year to date in China. With so much bad news, it's no surprise that Apple stock has lost more than $20 of its value since late January. And now here comes the worst news:\u00a0Apple's stock price may not recover anytime soon.\nIn fact, according to Maxim Group analyst Tom Forte, Apple stock could be \"dead money\" for a \"prolonged\" period.\nNow it's worth pointing out: Even Forte isn't saying Apple stock is a sell -- he just doesn't think it's going to go up much anytime soon, setting a $178 price target over the next year, and so rates Apple hold.\nAnd why does he think that? As StreetInsider reports, Apple gets 18.9% of its revenue from China -- where its iPhone sales are cratering under government pressure to stop using the devices. And seeing as iPhone accounts for the majority of Apple's operating profit, that's a big drag on growth at Apple. While the company has had some success growing services revenue, the drag on hardware sales, as well as increased regulatory scrutiny of monopolies around the globe, could prevent Apple from growing its sales -- or its stock price -- much at all over the near term.\nOr the long term, either.\nConsider that most analysts see Apple's profits growing at only about 10% annually over the next five years. That's not a bad growth rate, exactly. But on a stock that costs more than 26 times earnings, it may not be fast enough to sustain the stock price. For a high-quality, high-profit-margin company like Apple, you might not expect to ever see a PEG ratio of exactly 1 -- but unless Apple can find a way to revive iPhone sales, a 2.5 PEG is probably too much to pay for Apple's stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

As of the closing bell on March 28, 2024, the S&P 500 had gained in the neighborhood of 34,400%, including dividends paid, since Buffett took the reins. In comparison, the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a jaw-dropping aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,126,746% since the mid-1960s!\nBoth professional and retail investors frequently await Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to gain an understanding of what stocks Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying and selling. While Buffett is just as fallible as any other investor, he's demonstrated a knack for finding value in plain sight.\nSomething else Warren Buffett is known for is portfolio concentration. Even though the Oracle of Omaha and his team are overseeing a $373 billion portfolio containing 45 stocks and two index funds, the vast majority of Berkshire's invested assets have been put to work in just a few companies -- the \"top ideas.\"\nWhile 13Fs would give investors the impression that tech titan Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Buffett's unquestioned favorite stock -- Berkshire's Apple stake accounts for 42% ($155 billion) of invested assets -- a deeper dive into how Berkshire Hathaway puts its cash to work points to another even more beloved stock as the Oracle's cream of the crop.\nLet me preface this discussion by noting that Warren Buffett and his team of investors absolutely love Apple as a business. In fact, Buffett himself described Apple as \"a better business than any we own\" during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting last year. It's why an estimated $36 billion has been put to work by Buffett and Co. in shares of Apple since the start of 2016.\nThere are plenty of reasons for Buffett to feel the way he does about Apple. To start with, it's one of the most valuable brands globally, and it sports an exceptionally loyal customer base. A brand study conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 notes that iPhone users are more likely to stick with Apple for their next smartphone purchase than Samsung owners are to buy another Samsung smartphone.\nThere's also the domestic dominance of Apple's iPhone. Since introducing an iPhone that supports 5G speeds in the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple has consistently accounted for a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market.\nHowever, the company's future growth boils down to its shift to subscription services. Although Apple has no intention of abandoning the physical products that brought it fame (the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch), focusing on subscription services should provide a lift to its operating margin, enhance the value of its product and service ecosystem, and keep customers loyal to its brand.\nBut if you asked Warren Buffett to pinpoint the one aspect about Apple he loves most, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising if he flagged Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, Apple has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only do buybacks help reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can provide a lift to earnings per share (EPS), they're a means to increase the ownership stakes of existing shareholders. As time passes, Berkshire is becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to buy a single share.\nBut the fact remains that the estimated $36 billion Warren Buffett and his team have put to work in Apple over the past eight years takes a back seat to an even more loved stock.\nTruth be told, Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs fail to tell the full story about the company's holdings or what the Oracle of Omaha has been doing with Berkshire's cash. For a more encompassing view, investors will need to dive into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results.\nJust prior to the executive certifications at the end of Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly earnings reports is a section on the company's share repurchase activity. The reason I bring this up is because Warren Buffett has spent considerably more buying back Berkshire Hathaway stock than he and his top aides have spent purchasing shares of any other stock, including Apple.\nDuring the December-ended quarter, Buffett gave the green light for the repurchase of 3,623 shares of Berkshire's Class A stock and 660,585 shares of Class B stock (BRK.B), which came at a cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the midpoint of 2018, Buffett and his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who he referred to as the \"Architect of Berkshire Hathaway\" in his latest annual letter to shareholders, OK'd the repurchase of more than $74 billion worth of their own company's shares. That's more than twice the amount spent buying shares of Apple.\nPrior to July 2018, Berkshire's share repurchase program only allowed the Oracle of Omaha to buy shares of his company if they traded at or below 120% of book value (no more than 20% of reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire stock never fell to or below this threshold, Warren Buffett was forced to sit on his hands and go years without repurchasing a single share.\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked its buyback criteria:\nAs long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on its balance sheet; and\nWarren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger agree their stock is intrinsically cheap, buybacks can be made without any end date or ceiling.\nSuffice it to say, more than $74 billion in share repurchases over the last 22 quarters makes it plainly obvious that Berkshire Hathaway is Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy.\nSince Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, share buybacks are the easiest way he can reward investors who share his long-term vision. These buybacks are slowly but steadily increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's shareholders, as well as increasing EPS. In other words, putting his company's cash to work via buybacks is making Berkshire Hathaway more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\nWith a record $167.6 billion in available cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on the balance sheet, as of the end of 2023, Buffett has more than enough firepower to continue buying back shares of his company.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

Apple revealed the lay-offs in state filings in California.\nIt comes after Tim Cook cancelled the company\u2019s efforts to develop a self-driving car, dubbed Project Titan, which reportedly had over 2,000 staff.\nThe project was launched in secret in 2014 and has since gone through repeated restructurings and leadership changes as Apple grappled with how to enter the fiercely competitive automotive industry.\nAt one point, Apple had planned to build a fully autonomous vehicle that could drive itself. The company operated a test fleet of self-driving cars on California\u2019s roads.\nLast year, it had 67 Lexus SUVs registered with Californian officials that had been vetted to test its software.\nThe decision to ditch the electric vehicle comes as global demand for battery-powered cars wanes.\nThe cars remain more expensive than petrol equivalents at the budget end of the market, while high inflation has dampened demand for new cars overall.\nOn Tuesday, Tesla\u2019s shares fell by more than 5pc after it disappointed investors with a report that deliveries of its popular electric cars had fallen sharply.\nThe job cuts at Apple include hundreds of roles in the Californian city of Santa Clara, according to state filings. Earlier this year, Apple also cut 121 jobs from an office in San Diego.\nUnlike other tech giants such as Google and Meta, Apple has largely avoided such public mass redundancies. While it has given up on its electric vehicle dream, Apple has shifted its efforts towards embedding more powerful artificial intelligence technology in its gadgets.\nBloomberg reported on Wednesday that it is also planning a push into home robotics.

        "Text": "By Josh Ye and Mrinmay Dey\n(Reuters) -Apple said on Friday it had removed Meta Platforms' WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China after being ordered to do so by the Chinese government, which cited national security concerns.\nTelegram and Signal - two other foreign messaging apps - were also removed from the store on Friday, according to app tracking firms Qimai and AppMagic.\nThe removal of the four apps suggests growing intolerance on the part of China's central government towards at least some foreign online messaging services that fall outside of its control. It also signals less leeway for Apple in China.\nThat said, other Meta apps including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger remained available to download, according to Reuters checks on Friday. Many other popular apps developed by Western companies including YouTube and X were also available.\nIt was not immediately clear how WhatsApp or Threads might have caused security concerns for Chinese authorities.\n\"The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\" Apple said in an emailed statement.\n\"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,\" the statement said.\nMeta declined to comment and referred queries to Apple.\nApple did not respond to requests for comment on Signal and Telegram. Representatives for the two companies did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNone of the four apps are widely used in China - where Tencent's WeChat is by far the dominant service.\nThese apps and many foreign apps are normally blocked on Chinese networks by the \"Great Firewall\" - the country's extensive cybersystem of censorship - and can only be used with a virtual private network or other proxy tools.\nThe four apps remain available in Hong Kong and Macau, China's two special administrative regions.\nSome experts on China's tech industry said the government order on WhatsApp and Threads could be related to a new rule last August that requires all apps available in China to register with the government or risk being removed.\nThe deadline for companies to complete registrations was the end of March and the regulations came into effect on April 1.\nApple has removed apps from its China app store before.\nIn 2017, Apple removed The New York Times news app, saying it violated local regulations - a move that came amid rising news censorship in the world's second-largest economy. It remains unavailable on Apple's China App Store.\nLast year, Apple pulled a number of ChatGPT-like apps when Beijing was working on local regulations on generative artificial intelligence (AI) services.\nThe removal of WhatsApp and Threads from the China App Store was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n(Reporting by Josh Ye in Hong Kong, Mrinmay Dey and Nilutpal Timsina in Bengaluru; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It wasn't long ago that smartphone users had plenty of reasons to upgrade after two years. Smartphones were getting significantly better each year. Snappier processors, more vibrant screens, and greatly improved cameras whetted consumers' appetites for new phones.\nToday, innovation in the smartphone industry is tougher to find. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 15 family looks and performs an awful lot like its predecessor. For those with much older iPhones, an upgrade may make sense. But most people who upgraded within the past few years aren't missing much by skipping this generation.\nWhile one month doesn't make a trend, February was a rough month for Apple's most important business. According to UBS, iPhone sales in the U.S. dropped 9% year over year, sales in China were down 16%, and sales in India were down 13%. There was solid growth in Europe, but overall sales were down 4% worldwide. UBS expects Apple to sell 51 million iPhones in the first calendar quarter, down from 56 million last year.\nUBS cited a few reasons for the decline. In China, fierce competition from Huawei and other domestic competitors is proving to be a stiff challenge. In the U.S., the popularity of Samsung's recent Galaxy smartphones and weak carrier upgrade rates are hurting iPhone sales.\nThere could be multiple drivers behind the decline in carrier upgrade rates. One driver is probably that new smartphones just aren't very exciting anymore. With Apple churning out incremental upgrades year after year, it may be getting tough to sell consumers on its latest devices.\nHigher interest rates may also be a factor. Wireless carriers often offer incentives such as cheap financing or big discounts on new smartphones. Now that prevailing interest rates are no longer at historic lows, providing cheap financing has become a more expensive proposition.\nThe interests of wireless carriers and Apple also aren't quite lined up. Carriers use smartphone incentives to help pluck customers from their rivals, but ultimately, the goal is retaining wireless subscribers, not selling phones. While a lower upgrade rate is a major problem for Apple, it's only a minor problem for wireless carriers.\nApple appears to have missed the generative AI boat. The company is reportedly in talks with Alphabet's Google to use the Gemini AI model to power iPhone AI features, a sign that the company is nowhere close to developing something similar on its own.\nThe jury is still out on whether generative AI models run locally on smartphones will prove to be a game-changer. If it is, Apple is probably going to be playing from behind.\nRecent antitrust developments raise the risks for Apple's most important products. The U.S. Justice Department is suing Apple on charges of monopolizing the smartphone market, with one of the key sticking points being the company's efforts to make it difficult for consumers to switch away from the iPhone.\nIf Apple is forced to make changes that lower switching costs for consumers, the cost of its slowing rate of innovation and its AI subservience could be amplified. Companies tend to become more risk-averse as they grow larger, and Apple is the largest of them all.\nOne thing that we can be absolutely sure of is that the iPhone will eventually be disrupted. Given Apple's strategy of incremental upgrades and its AI missteps, I'm willing to bet that whatever ultimately disrupts the iPhone won't be coming from Cupertino.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Berkshire Hathaway's investment represents 5.9% ownership of Apple, making up about 43% of Berkshire's portfolio. For context, Berkshire's second-largest stock investment, Bank of America, is less than one-fourth the size of its Apple stake.\nBerkshire Hathaway first reported Apple stock in its portfolio in the first quarter of 2016. It started as a small investment (for Berkshire), with the company initially spending about $1.1 billion on Apple shares at that time. It was also confirmed that Buffett didn't initiate the investment -- one of his investment managers (Ted Weschler or Todd Combs) initially pulled the trigger on it.\nHowever, Buffett certainly had a lot to do with the current Apple investment. Over the following three-year period, Berkshire accumulated nearly 1 billion shares of Apple. It has since sold a bit, as you can see in the current share count, but there was a period when Buffett was on quite a buying spree.\nIn all, Berkshire paid a split-adjusted price of $39.62 per share for its Apple stake, which corresponds to an overall cost basis of about $35.9 billion. As mentioned, the investment is now worth $156 billion, which is an overall gain of over $120 billion. In terms of a percentage, this means Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are up by about 335% on their Apple investment, making it one of the biggest winners (and the biggest winner in terms of dollars gained) in the legendary investor's career.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The firm expects Boeing's quarterly earnings report in two weeks to prompt concerns about the company's underlying fundamentals and ultimately shift investor focus to liquidity and acquisition concerns.\nJPMorgan downgraded Fortive (FTV) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $90, down from $95. The firm also removed the shares from its Analyst Focus List. The company's Precision Technologies order trends have remained sluggish so far this year, with sales likely down through the first half of 2024 despite support from an excess backlog that is close to being exhausted, JPMorgan says.\nJefferies downgraded Urban Outfitters (URBN) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $32, down from $42.

With Apple and Qualcomm extending its modem supply agreement to 2026 and now to March 2027, questions linger as to whether Apple can ever move on from Qualcomm on the modem front.\nWho knows? Perhaps the overly ambitious modem plans could share the same fate as Project Titan, the electric vehicle project that Apple has since pulled the plug on.\nIn any case, Qualcomm will be supplying modems for the next couple of iPhones. That will likely be enough to benefit from the next iPhone (mini) super-cycle that may very well be powered by new AI hardware, software and services. Beyond Apple, Qualcomm looks well-equipped to benefit from the AI PC and smartphone boom as it makes its own AI chips.\nIn short, Qualcomm stands to gain if the iPhone 16 or 17 experiences a big boom in demand, likely from new AI features.

Of late, it\u2019s been a curse, with SWKS stock down nearly 50% from its peak, with barely any meaningful momentum for rebound chasers to get excited about.\nIf we are on the cusp of an AI iPhone sales boom, perhaps Skyworks stock could gain more than Apple stock.

This is particularly true in the case of Donald Trump, who is famously outspoken and who references the stock market\u2019s performance more than most presidents.\nRead More: Trump-Era Tax Cuts Are Expiring \u2014 How Changes Will Impact RetireesFind Out: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nRegardless of your own view on politics, as an investor, it\u2019s important to keep your eye on all potentially market-moving events, including the November 2024 presidential election. If Trump were to be re-elected, he may reinstate some of the policies from his first term and this could affect big tech stocks like Apple, among others. With that in mind, here\u2019s a look at how Apple did under Trump\u2019s presidency and how another term might affect your Apple investment.\nAlso see how another Biden presidency might affect your Apple investment.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nTrump\u2019s first day in office was January 20, 2017. On that day, Apple closed at a price of $27.88. When Trump handed over the reins to Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, Apple closed at $129.57. This amounts to a return of 365%.\nAn interesting note is that Apple\u2019s share price as of April 24, 2024 was just $169.02, meaning in the three-plus years since Trump left office, Apple has \u201conly\u201d returned 30%.\nFor You: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nApple is often the biggest stock in the S&P 500, but as it has fallen in 2024 as the broad market has advanced, it has slipped to the number two position, behind tech giant Microsoft. Still, Apple comprises 5.76% of the entire S&P 500, so it can have a huge effect on the market overall.\nThus, even if you only own an S&P 500 index fund and don\u2019t own Apple directly, any Trump policies affecting Apple can also push your investment higher or lower. By way of reference, the S&P 500 index returned 67% during President Trump\u2019s term.\nTrump already has a complicated relationship with Apple and that\u2019s likely to continue if he\u2019s re-elected in November. When Trump unleashed his stiff tariffs on China \u2014 one of the signature policy pieces of his term in office \u2014 Apple got caught in the crossfire, as China is one of its biggest suppliers. As the company tried to find a way to avoid paying tariffs, as reported by The New York Times, Trump laid down the gauntlet in a July 26, 2019 tweet, saying \u201cApple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China\u201d and that the company should \u201cMake them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d\nHowever, over time, Apple managed to avoid most of these tariffs. In August 2019, Trump said \u201cI had a very good meeting with Tim Cook [\u2026] Tim was talking to me about tariffs and one of the things, he made a good case, is that Samsung is their number one competitor and Samsung is not paying tariffs because they\u2019re based in South Korea. And it\u2019s tough for Apple to compete with a very good company that\u2019s not.\u201d Ultimately, Apple was able to avoid tariffs on its flagship iPhone, iPad and MacBook products and by March 2020, the Apple Watch joined that list as well.\nWhether or not these exemptions hold up if Trump is re-elected is anyone\u2019s guess. As Lee Munson, president of Portfolio Wealth Advisors said, \u201cBiden has not been friendly to China, but Trump\u2019s going to be even worse\u2026When you look at Trump, he\u2019s mercurial\u2026\u201d\u00a0What this means is that it\u2019s a gamble whether or not Trump will reinstate tariffs and if they will directly affect Apple this time around.\nWhether the next president will be Trump or Biden is just one of the factors you should consider when looking at a stock like Apple. While things like tariffs and Department of Justice investigations can affect individual stocks, many things beyond a president\u2019s control, such as interest rates, inflation, geopolitical turmoil and corporate earnings also play a big role in determining stock prices. For example, while tariffs on China might be an impediment for Apple, falling interest rates and/or inflation, as many predict for 2024 and 2025, would be tailwinds for the stock.\nIf you\u2019re a long-term investor, you should take into account who\u2019s in the White House, but you should balance this against product development and long-term earnings trends. If you believe Apple is an innovative company that can survive, adapt and continue to grow in any environment, then it shouldn\u2019t matter if Trump wins re-election or not. On the other hand, if you feel Apple\u2019s best days are behind it, you should likely sell the stock no matter who the president is.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nI'm a Shopping Expert: 9 Items I'd Never Put in My Grocery Cart\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nThis is One of the Best Ways to Boost Your Retirement Savings in 2024\n7 Things You'll Be Happy You Downgraded in Retirement\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Another Trump Presidency Might Affect Your Apple Investment\n"

        "Title": "How a DCF Analysis Supports the Bull Case for Apple",
        "Author": "  DM Martins' Research ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has not been receiving quite as much love from investors as it usually does. The stock is down 9% so far in 2024 against the S&P 500's (SPY) 7% gains through mid-April.\nSome of the recent bearishness toward the Cupertino, California-based tech company is founded on short-term concerns. For instance, iPhone sales in the important China market seemed to be under pressure at the start of the year. Others worry more about the core of Apple's business. For example, the company's ecosystem remains under the scrutiny of regulatory agencies around the world. In addition, some fear that Apple may have missed the boat on artificial intelligence.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TJX.\nThe bulls, however, may have good reason to cheer the recent pullback as an opportunity to buy the stock at more attractive levels. A discounted cash flow analysis may help to put numbers around the optimism.\nTo the benefit of those unfamiliar, DCF is an intrinsic valuation methodology in which future free cash flows produced by a company can be discounted to present value to arrive at a fair value of the stock. Because Apple runs two interdependent but largely dissimilar business segments, namely products and services, I like to think of the stock's value as two separate pieces.\nProducts is a segment that includes primarily the iPhone, representing roughly half of Apple's total revenues, but also the Mac, iPad as well as wearable and home devices. The products segment featured relatively low margins of 37% in fiscal 2023 compared to the services segment's nearly 71%.\nIn isolation, products is an inferior business to services not only because of the lower margins, but also because of less predictability around future revenue, earnings and cash flow. Still, I think is it reasonable to expect Apple's product sales to rise by an average of 5% per year through the next five years, albeit not without year-to-year ebbs and flows.\nThe segment would benefit from the iPhone's competitive advantages and brand loyalty, and the full-scale launch of mixed-reality devices. I see this growth rate declining to 3.50% for the next five years before normalizing at a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.\nRegarding profitability, I think it is prudent to assume that Ebit margins will level out, despite them having risen lately due to a heavier mix of pricier devices like the iPhone Pro and Pro Max and the margin gains driven by Apple's M-family of chips. On working capital, I also conservatively assume that the company will not produce any additional cash flow, despite having done so in the past several years through tight inventory and payables management.\nLastly, I think it is reasonable to discount Apple's future product cash flows at a rate of 12.50%. While this rate seems too high for the company at large, it better reflects the lower growth and higher risk profile of the device business. Using the assumptions above, I estimate the fair value of Apple's product segment is roughly $1.14 trillion.\nIn my view, the majority of the market value created by Apple comes from the relatively smaller services business. This segment, which represented only 22% of total revenue in fiscal 2023, is much more profitable and produces cash flows more predictably.\nOn the first point, services like the App Store and Apple TV+ tend to be highly scalable. While either may generate substantial costs to operate, each marginal dollar in revenue tends to flow straight to operating income, as it produces relatively little in marginal costs. On the latter point, much of Apple's service revenues are either derived from subscriptions or locked in by contract (think about Apple Care as an example). It is no wonder that service revenues have been remarkably stable over time, as the chart below depicts.\nFor the next five years, I assume services will grow sales at an annual rate of 12%, which is consistent with recent history, although conservative relative to how fast service revenue used to grow before last year. On Ebit margins, I assume an expansion of 100 basis points per year through 2028 due to the scale factor mentioned above. I think free cash flow growth then slows down from an average of 12% per year between 2023 and 2028 to 8% between 2029 and 2033, before settling at a much lower perpetuity growth rate of 2% beyond the next decade.\nThe discount rate used for services should logically be much lower than that used for Apple's products business. This is the case because of the higher margins, better scalability and lower volatility of future cash flows, as mentioned above. Therefore, I think a discount rate of 7.50% for the services segment, which is three percentage points higher than the 10-year treasury yield, is appropriate.\nUsing the assumptions above, I arrive at a fair value of $1.93 trillion for the services segment. Added to products' $1.14 trillion and $51 billion in net cash, Apple stock should then be worth roughly $3.10 trillion or $200 per share, which represents 14% of upside potential to the current price.\nOf course, a DCF analysis is only as good as the assumptions that go into it. For instance, I could project that services will grow at 3% per year in perpetuity beyond 2033, and that would give me a fair value on Apple shares of $217.50 for 24% upside potential. Instead, if I assume the discount rate applied to the services business should be 10% instead of 7.50%, then Apple shares would be worth only about $160 for a 10% downside potential.\nThe more important point, however, is this year's 9% decline in Apple stock price and 11% pullback since the December 2023 all-time high provides investors with a wider margin of error. Assuming I am right about Apple shares being worth $200, having bought them a mere four months ago would have been a bad move. Buying now instead could produce decent double-digit gains, which I believe will materialize in the next 12 months.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Other tech giants like Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have taken similar steps in recent years.\nIn the past, subscriber numbers have been wildly unpredictable, and the company has struggled to forecast them accurately. In 2022, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said it would stop projecting quarterly customer data. The stock typically sees big swings the day after earnings reports.\nOn Thursday, Netflix reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, including 9.33 million new subscribers. But the shares slumped after the company said user growth this quarter would slow and that it will stop reporting customer numbers.\n\u201cEliminating regular reporting of membership data raises questions around management\u2019s confidence to further grow the base, though it is not implausible that the change is intended to reduce quarterly sentiment volatility around relatively small changes in true economic drivers,\u201d Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note to investors.\nNetflix isn\u2019t the only big tech company to pull back on disclosing some metrics in order to steer investors\u2019 focus elsewhere.\nIn 2018, Apple said it would no longer report the number of iPhones, Macs and iPads sold each quarter, as it attempted to focus on its growing services unit. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, others complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market. The shares had their worst day in four years.\nLast quarter, Meta said it will no longer report the number of subscribers to its family of apps, which now total almost 4 billion people who use Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp each month. The San Francisco-based company said it also won\u2019t provide daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app.\nBeginning this quarter, Meta will report year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps.\n\u201cFewer disclosures is a rite of passage for large tech companies namely Apple, Google, and Meta,\u201d analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. \u201cOn the other hand, removing growth disclosures signals a maturing business, and gives shareholders even fewer data points to underwrite forecasts. Time will tell how investors digest the change.\u201d\nThe good news for Netflix is that its decision, while angering some investors, is unlikely to have any impact on customers \u2014 its primary focus.\nIn 2011, the company was forced to backtrack on plans to split its mail-order DVD and internet streaming services. Customers were outraged over plans to create a separate DVD offering called Qwikster, and to pay for each service separately. The company reversed the decision three weeks later.\nNetflix\u2019s growth in the latest quarter was aided by a crackdown on account sharing, which pushes viewers using someone else\u2019s password to sign up on their own at a discounted rate. The company attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well.\nIn explaining the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said initiatives like the crackdown and a new ad-supported tier make those metrics less relevant.\n\u201cAll of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,\u201d he said in a video interview Thursday.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender\nBig Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner\nHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets\nChina\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires\nSkip the Robotaxi\u2014Tesla Investors Want a Cheap EV\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "KINSHASA (Reuters) -Democratic Republic of Congo is pushing Apple Inc for more information about its supply chain over concerns it may be tainted with conflict minerals sourced from the country, international lawyers engaged by Congo said on Thursday.\nCongo, particularly its eastern region, has been plagued by violence since the 1990s, killing millions as struggles over national identity, ethnicity, and resources saw neighbouring countries invade and a myriad of armed groups spring up.\nConflict has arisen over the control of illicit trade in tin and gold as well as in coltan and tantalum - widely used in cell phones and computers - all mined in Congo before being smuggled out through neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.\nIn September 2023, Congo President Felix Tshisekedi met with international law firm Amsterdam & Partners LLP to investigate the supply chain of tin, tungsten and tantalum - known as 3T minerals - due to concerns about illegal exports, the law firm said.\nIt said it had notified Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday of a series of questions based on fears about its supply chain and also wrote to Apple subsidiaries in France, requesting answers within three weeks.\n\"Although Apple has affirmed that it verifies the origins of minerals it uses to manufacture its products, those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence,\" Amsterdam said in a statement on Thursday.\n\"The world's eyes are wide shut: Rwanda's production of key 3T minerals is near zero, and yet big tech companies say their minerals are sourced in Rwanda,\" it said.\nApple referred Reuters to its latest Conflict Minerals Report.\nIt said that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in the supply chain for all applicable Apple products manufactured in 2023 had participated in an independent third-party conflict minerals audit for 3T minerals and gold (3TG).\n\"We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,\" the Apple report said.\nThe Amsterdam statement coincided with the release of a report by the law firm accusing Rwanda and private entities of laundering 3T and other conflict minerals from Congo.\nRwanda and Congo's governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nCongo is the world's leading producer of tantalum, followed by Rwanda.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>The ABR suggests buying Apple, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs AAPL a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.55.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis.

        "Title": "Will Apple (AAPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Apple (AAPL), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry.\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.67%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Apple came out with earnings of $2.18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 4.31%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.46 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.04%.\nFor Apple, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +1.80% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 2, 2024.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Apple\u2019s high-yield savings account rate drops to 4.40% APY",
        "Author": "  Karen Bennett ",
        "Text": "The rate of return has dropped slightly on the high-yield savings account available to Apple Card users. The new annual percentage yield (APY) of 4.40 percent reflects a decrease from the previous rate of 4.50 percent APY.\nThe Apple Card Savings account, which is provided through a partnership between Apple and Goldman Sachs, continues not to charge monthly service fees or require any minimum balance amount. Funds in the account are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). The card is accessible through the Apple Wallet.\nDespite the rate decrease, the yield on the Apple Card Savings account remains significantly higher than the national average savings account APY of just 0.59 percent. Across banks, APYs of up to 5.35 percent are available on high-yield savings accounts.\nHere\u2019s how the Apple Card Savings account stacks up against other high-yield savings accounts, when it comes to APY and minimum deposit requirements:\nBank account\nAPY\nMin. deposit\nBrioDirect High-Yield Savings Account\n5.35% APY\n$5,000\nBread Savings High-Yield Savings Account\n5.15% APY\n$100\nBask Bank Interest Savings Account\n5.10% APY\n$0\nApple Card Savings account\n4.40% APY\n$0\nAlly Bank Savings Account\n4.25% APY\n$0\nThe Apple Card Savings account initially earned 4.15 percent APY when it was introduced in April 2023, which was four years after Apple and Goldman Sachs partnered to make the Apple Card. This cash-back credit card is geared toward those who use Apple Pay via an iPhone or Apple Watch, and it helps users earn up to 3 percent cash back on all purchases.\nThose who have the Apple high-yield savings account can manage the account through the Apple Card in the Wallet app. The maximum balance for the savings account is capped at $250,000. While it\u2019s not possible to deposit cash into the savings account, deposits can be made as transfers from an external bank account or from Apple Cash.\nAt 4.40 percent APY, the Apple Card Savings account earns a significantly higher yield than the national average APY of just 0.59 percent. It can be a convenient option for Apple Card holders (you\u2019ll need an Apple Card to open the savings account), and it\u2019s easy to access and manage the savings account in the Wallet app. Unlike many other high-yield savings accounts, it requires no minimum deposit. If you\u2019re looking for the highest APY available, however, you\u2019ll find that with other savings accounts instead.\n"

        "Title": "Apple supplier Jabil benches its CEO as it investigates his conduct\u2014but he\u2019ll still collect his full $1 million salary",
        "Author": "  Amanda Gerut ",
        "Text": "Jabil CEO Kenny Wilson, still in his first year at the helm of the $14.4 billion technology manufacturing company, has been benched due to an investigation into his conduct, the company said in a short regulatory filing.\nThe board asked chief financial officer Michael Dastoor to step in as interim CEO on April 19 after putting Wilson on leave April 15, according to the filing. Jabil didn\u2019t provide information about the concern or incident that launched the probe, only saying that the behavior that prompted it is unrelated to the company\u2019s financial statements or financial reporting. Wilson is two weeks away from completing his first year in the CEO seat after taking it May 1, 2023. Jabil, with more than 140,000 employees globally, maintains a hotline through third-party platform Resolver to anonymously report code of ethics violations or other complaints. The company is based in Tampa Bay, Fla., and manufactures electronic parts for tech companies. Its largest customers include Apple, Cisco Systems, Dell Technologies, HP, and General Electric.\nIt is unclear who is leading the Jabil investigation. Typically, if an investigation into a CEO\u2019s conduct originates with financial concerns, the audit committee would initiate and lead it, said Matteo Tonello, a corporate governance expert and managing director at the Conference Board. In cases outside of financials, there are multiple approaches the board can take, he told Fortune. For instance, the board could form an internal committee to oversee the investigation while an outside law firm or consultant conducts it. Typically, when an investigation involves the CEO, it\u2019s led by the board to avoid executives undertaking a review of their boss.\nInvestigations can involve data obtained from text-based searches of company servers; mirroring a CEO\u2019s cell phone or other devices; conducting interviews with employees, contractors, or customers; and reviewing documents. Law firms are often tapped because they have expertise in avoiding infringing on the rights of those being investigated, said Tonello. Companies could subject themselves to liability after an investigation because of the way the probe was conducted; sometimes CEOs hire their own counsel to represent them while an investigation is underway. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean if you hire a law firm, the company wouldn\u2019t be involved,\u201d he noted, adding that legal and compliance staff are generally looped in along with the general counsel.\nThe length of probes varies, Tonello said; sometimes it concludes in a few days or weeks while others take months. \u201cIt depends on the nature of the allegations and what they entail,\u201d he said.\nA spokesman for Jabil would not comment beyond what the company said in the filing, only noting that Dastoor has the support of the senior leadership team while he steps in for Wilson. \u201cTrust, accountability, and integrity are core to our company culture, and we are committed to upholding these principles,\u201d Timur Aydin, director of enterprise content and media, said in a statement to Fortune.\nWilson, 58, first joined the company in 2000 in Livingston, Scotland, as a business unit coordinator, and served successful stints leading Jabil\u2019s businesses in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. His last role before taking the corner office in Florida was as CEO of Jabil\u2019s Green Point organization in Asia. The company announced in November 2022 that Wilson would take the reins from former CEO Mark Mondello the following May, which culminated in an orderly transition at the manufacturer, with hardly a ripple. Mondello, who has more than three decades of tenure at the company, still serves as its chairman.\nIn connection with Wilson\u2019s promotion last year, the board bumped up his pay about 43% to a base salary of about $1 million, which he\u2019ll continue to collect while the investigation pans out. His total compensation last year was valued at $10.2 million, largely driven by a stock award valued at $6.2 million. His sons, Jordan Wilson and Adam Wilson, both hold the title of business unit coordinator, the same one their father held.\nJabil, which had net revenues of $34.7 billion in fiscal 2023, disclosed that 17% of its net revenue comes from sales to Apple. A key tenet of its strategy is to build and maintain long-term relationships with leading companies in expanding industries that need highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing operations around the globe.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Could Apple Help You Retire a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made a lot of millionaires over the years, with its shares up 792% over the last decade. However, it hit some roadblocks in 2024, with its stock down 11% year to date.\nMacroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\nHowever, outperforming estimates hasn't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of Apple's business. In the first quarter of 2024, the company's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales yet they fell 13% in China. The East Asian country increasingly prefers domestic brands over the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.\nThen, on March 4, Apple's stock dipped again after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service. \nDespite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. The question remains: Is Apple still a millionaire maker, and could it make you one by the time you retire?\nIt's hard to deny Apple's powerful position in tech. The company has leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.\nThe popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows that Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.\nWhile declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.\nMoreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030.\nApple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance. As a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.\nApple is on a promising growth path and has a long history of reliability. Its dominant role in tech and investments in budding industries like VR/AR and artificial intelligence (AI) will likely fuel its stock price for years.\nThis chart shows Apple's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying this figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26 yields a share price of $208, projecting stock growth of 23% over the next two fiscal years. These projections would likely see Apple continue to outperform the S&P 500, which has increased by 13% over the last two years.\nAs a result, Apple's stock remains an attractive addition to a diversified portfolio. Its significant cash reserves and potent brand make it an excellent option to hold over many years, as one does when preparing for retirement. I wouldn't bet against Apple's reliability and tendency to deliver major gains over the long term.\nIf you're less than five years from retirement, there are likely better options than Apple as it will need time to overcome recent headwinds. However, if you're an early stage investor with 20 or more years to go, the right investment can help make you a millionaire by the time you retire, and Apple stock could play a useful part in helping you achieve that goal.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Shomik Sen Bhattacharjee ",
        "Text": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\nBy 2026, India is set to surpass both Japan and the UK to become the third-largest iPhone market for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), according to a report by Counterpoint Research.\nApple witnessed a significant milestone in India in 2023 as iPhone shipments crossed the 10 million mark for the first time, thus leading to revenue generation.\nSee also:\u00a0X Launches Community Notes In India, Just In Time For Elections\nInterestingly, iPhones produced in India contributed 13% to the global shipments in 2023, representing an impressive leap from a mere 1% in 2018. This surge is attributed to Apple's growing brand affinity in the country, positioning India as the technology giant's fastest-growing market in the forthcoming years.\nLooking forward, it is projected that by 2025, Apple's services sector will account for a quarter of its total revenue, with expectations of crossing the $100 billion mark annually. The thriving Apple ecosystem, sustained by an installed base of over two billion devices, is driven by services like the Apple Store, Apple Care+, and the AppleOne subscription.\nIntroduced in 2023, the Apple One subscription is expected to significantly boost Apple's service revenue, underlining the crucial role played by the iPhone within Apple's ecosystem. As Apple continues to penetrate emerging markets, the demand for iPhones not only bolsters its sales but also fosters growth across Apple's product range, luring new users into the iOS ecosystem.\nRead next:\u00a0Tesla Scouts For Locations In India For A Proposed $2Bn-$3Bn Electric Car Plant\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Not UK Or Japan: India To Emerge As Apple's Third-Largest iPhone Market In Just 2 Years originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been a wild mover in recent sessions, blasting off on excitement for AI-centric M4 Macs, only to plunge in the following sessions.\nIndeed, Apple\u2019s prior chips featured Neural Engines that helped power various background applications. However, many iPhone users probably viewed the hardware as an afterthought rather than a main draw to buy the latest iPhone.\nAfter exploring the possibilities with today\u2019s AI chatbots (like ChatGPT), its AI-focused hardware, such as the Apple Neural Engine, may now be a top selling point as Apple looks to get its many users to upgrade. As AI PCs, smartphones and the AI-powered silicon that powers them enter the chat, things may finally look up for Apple again.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nIf Apple has what it takes to catch up in AI, the following AI stocks may benefit from its success.\nSource: Shutterstock\nApple hasn\u2019t been able to replace Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modems in its iPhone quite yet. With Apple and Qualcomm extending its modem supply agreement to 2026 and now to March 2027, questions linger as to whether Apple can ever move on from Qualcomm on the modem front.\nWho knows? Perhaps the overly ambitious modem plans could share the same fate as Project Titan, the electric vehicle project that Apple has since pulled the plug on.\nIn any case, Qualcomm will be supplying modems for the next couple of iPhones. That will likely be enough to benefit from the next iPhone (mini) super-cycle that may very well be powered by new AI hardware, software and services. Beyond Apple, Qualcomm looks well-equipped to benefit from the AI PC and smartphone boom as it makes its own AI chips.\nIn short, Qualcomm stands to gain if the iPhone 16 or 17 experiences a big boom in demand, likely from new AI features. That said, it doesn\u2019t solely rely on Apple for its prosperity.\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) stock is in the process of breaking out right now, with shares just shy of the $140 mark. If Apple helps lead the charge toward AI-powered smartphones, Taiwan Semiconductor may have the final nudge to leave prior highs well behind it.\nFurther, Taiwan Semiconductor doesn\u2019t just stand to benefit from an iPhone super-cycle; it stands to benefit from an AI phone boom at large. The $725 billion foundry juggernaut is already showing signs of tailwinds from the AI chip boom, with the firm recently experiencing a sales growth spurt in March, its largest since November 2022.\nAt this pace, it\u2019s hard not to view TSM stock as one of those AI-at-a-reasonable-price types of plays as more investors move on from some of the more overcrowded AI trades in the market.\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a major supplier to Apple, with more than half (sometimes much more than half) of overall revenues derived from the iPhone maker. Indeed, the mobile chip maker\u2019s heavy reliance on Apple can be both a blessing and a curse. Of late, it\u2019s been a curse, with SWKS stock down nearly 50% from its peak, with barely any meaningful momentum for rebound chasers to get excited about.\nIf we are on the cusp of an AI iPhone sales boom, perhaps Skyworks stock could gain more than Apple stock. Undoubtedly, Skyworks has taken steps to lower its dependence on Apple over the years. Still, Apple remains the largest customer, which will help the firm pay most of the bills. If AI does help spark a much-awaited iPhone sales super-cycle, perhaps Skyworks\u2019 heavy dependence on Apple will be viewed as a good thing for once.\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owns shares of Apple.

        "Text": "Huawei\u2019s profits have surged more than six-fold after the Chinese technology champion overcame Western sanctions to steal market share from Apple.\nThe Shenzhen-based company reported a 19.6bn yuan (\u00a32.1bn) profit in the three months to March, up 564pc on the same period a year ago.\nThis comes despite facing US export controls and bans on overseas sales of its networking equipment in the last year, including in the UK.\nThe company released a new high-end smartphone in August that was made largely with home-grown microchips.\nThis proved to be a surprise hit among Chinese consumers and helped Huawei squeeze sales of Apple\u2019s iPhone in the Far East.\nIt has also been developing advanced artificial intelligence chips in an attempt to compete with Silicon Valley giant Nvidia, which has seen its sales to China curbed by the Biden administration.\nChina has invested heavily in catching up to the US and Taiwan in advanced semiconductor production, reaping rewards for companies like Huawei that have struggled to get hold of foreign-made chips.\nHuawei said revenues had risen by 37pc in the quarter to 178.5bn yuan. The sales came in the critical Chinese New Year period when shoppers typically spend heavily on electronics.\nThis marks a stark reversal in Huawei\u2019s fortunes after chief executive Guo Ping said in 2020 that the company\u2019s goal was \u201csurvival\u201d after \u201cnonstop aggression from the US government\u201d.\nIn December, the company said it was \u201cback on track\u201d, claiming it had weathered the storm after reporting an increase in annual revenues.\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, Huawei\u2019s smartphone sales in China rose by 70pc in the first quarter of the year, putting it almost level with Apple.\nBy comparison, Apple\u2019s sales are believed to have fallen sharply. The US tech giant is expected to reveal the scale of its China sales fall on Thursday when it reports results for the first three months of the year.\nChina has discouraged government employees from bringing foreign-made devices to work.\nHuawei is also investing heavily in smart car technology, seeking deals with major carmakers.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The speed with which artificial intelligence (AI) caught on last year took many investors by surprise, and it sparked a changing of the guard among the ranks of the world's most valuable companies. Apple was finally dethroned by Microsoft, which now tops the list as the only company that currently has a market cap of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its industry-leading AI processors, has tripled over the past year to take the No. 3 spot, behind Apple with $2.6 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all major players in the AI revolution and also members of this auspicious fraternity.\nWith a market cap of just $53 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like hyperbole to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, could make a run at the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI-centric servers and the company's decades of expertise suggest that Supermicro is a dark horse candidate in the race.\nWhile Supermicro has been creating customized server solutions for more than 30 years, the company was working in relative obscurity until the accelerating adoption of AI kicked off. It turns out that Supermicro has amassed quite a pedigree out of the glare of the spotlight.\nSupermicro has built its reputation by providing highly customizable, energy-efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale servers designed to handle the rigors of AI and hyperscale data centers. The company has developed strong working relationships and works hand-in-hand with all the top AI chipmakers to ensure its rack-scale servers are top performers while also providing energy efficiency and the lowest total cost of ownership in the industry. It boasts partnerships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\nThis is a winning strategy that has its AI-centric servers flying off the shelves. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 103% year over year to $3.7 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $5.10 jumped 85%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to $14.5 billion, which would represent growth of 104%.\nManagement reports that Supermicro grew five times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is stealing market share from its rivals. Analysts at Northland agree, suggesting the company has increased its market share to 11%, leaving \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nSupermicro is in an enviable position among AI server makers. The company is small enough to be nimble and has a long history of providing customized server solutions to enterprises. Furthermore, the strong and enduring relationships Supermicro has forged with chipmakers give it the inside track and an abundant supply of the processors used for AI. Despite those advantages and the clear opportunity, a lot will have to go right for Supermicro to join the ranks of the trillionaires.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.7 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $275 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. To be clear, the company is currently ramping up production to support annual sales of $25 billion, so revenue of that magnitude is still a ways off.\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit, year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2031. That said, it's unlikely the company will keep up its current rate of parabolic growth. If we cut its revenue growth rate assumption to 50%, Supermicro could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\nThere's reason to believe strong demand for AI-centric servers will continue. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya suggests the data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the next three years, and Supermicro's revenue could grow even faster.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is equally bullish, suggesting that the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the coming four to five years.\nIf Supermicro captures even a small part of that vast opportunity, the company will soon join the $1 trillion club.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Entry isn\u2019t guaranteed for fans, either, and tickets are limited to Masters lottery winners.\nAs of midway through the second round on Friday, the most affordable ticket for the final round at the Masters championship on Sunday cost $1,785.\nInstead of breaking the bank, many fans view the tournament on television, streaming platforms, or on the Masters web and mobile applications. Now, the Masters app, combined with IBM watsonx data and the Apple Vision Pro device, expands an experiential portal for fans who want to enjoy the event affordably from afar.\n\u201cThis partnership is a great example of how data and AI can lead to once-unimaginable digital experiences that help fans feel closer to the events they care about,\u201d Syken said.\nThose who are able to attend the event in person, however, are spending in droves on everything from restaurants and lodging to souvenirs.\nFans have been pouring into the gift shop at Augusta National and waiting in amusement park-like lines just to enter the store to purchase Masters golf merchandise, which can only be bought in person.\nAccording to a top Master Card economist, it shows the strong rebound of the experience economy and \u201cthe purchasing power that's still out there on aggregate.\u201d\n\u201cSmall businesses [are] seeing a really important lift,\" Mastercard Economics Institute chief US economist Michelle Meyer told Yahoo Finance about the impact of the Masters on Augusta's local economy. \"International folks [are] coming in.

Trust Wallet emphasized that high-value account holders are particularly at risk.\nA zero-day exploit refers to a cyberattack that exploits an unknown or unaddressed security vulnerability in computer software or hardware.

        "Author": "  GERALD IMRAY ",
        "Text": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 Congo \u2019s government is questioning Apple about the tech company\u2019s knowledge of \u201cblood minerals\u201d from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into its supply chains and is demanding answers within three weeks.\nA group of international lawyers representing Congo said Thursday that they sent letters to Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook and its French subsidiary this week, raising concerns about human rights violations involving the minerals extracted from mines in the country\u2019s troubled east that might end up being used in the company\u2019s products.\nThey included a list of questions challenging Apple to show how it monitors its supply chains in a region where more than 100 armed rebel groups operate, some of whom have been accused of carrying out mass killings of civilians.\nWriting to Cook, the lawyers said \u201cit has become clear to us that year after year, Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave violations of human rights.\u201d\n\"The iPhones, Mac computers and accessories that Apple sells to its customers around the world rely on supply chains that are too opaque, and that are tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,\" the lawyers said.\nEastern Congo is one of the most mineral-rich regions in the world but is also the site of a huge humanitarian disaster, with the armed groups fighting for years for control of the mines and the valuable minerals in them, and millions of people displaced and affected by the worsening violence. The situation has deteriorated badly in the last few months.\nApple, which has a market value of around $2.6 trillion, has denied using minerals from mines and regions where human rights violations take place, saying it conducts business ethically and \u201cresponsibly\u201d sources minerals in Congo and neighboring countries.\nThe minerals it buys don't finance war or armed groups, it says. The lawyers for the Congo government said \u201cthose claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence.\u201d\nThe Congo government said it has suspicions that some of the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold \u2014 known as the 3TG critical minerals \u2014 that Apple sources from suppliers is smuggled out of Congo to neighboring Rwanda and then infiltrated into the global supply chain. The 3TG minerals are key components in electronics.\nIn response to a request for comment, Apple pointed to a section from a company filing on conflict minerals.\n\u201cBased on our due diligence efforts, including analyzing the information provided by third-party audit programs, upstream traceability programs, and our suppliers, we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,\" the report said, using the abbreviation for Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\u201cIn Congo, people have been dying for 30 years as a result of illegal mining,\u201d Congo government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said. \u201cWe want clarification on the sources of supply for major technology companies, in particular Apple, to verify whether they are acquiring minerals produced in completely illegal conditions.\u201d\nHe said Rwanda \u201cis presented\u201d as the supplier for many of the minerals while having few reserves of its own.\nCongo has accused Rwanda of financing and directing the notorious armed rebel group M23 in eastern Congo to help extract minerals illegally. The United Nations also says M23 is backed by Rwanda.\nRwanda denies that but tensions between the countries are flaring, while M23 and other groups are accused of regularly carrying out attacks that include the killing and raping of civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.\nThe lawyers for the Congo government quoted a 2022 report by nonprofit group Global Witness that claimed Apple had previously applied \u201cfew meaningful mitigation measures\u201d to avoid using smuggled minerals.\nThe Congo government was now seeking \u201ceffective redress\u201d against \u201cend-users of blood minerals\u201d across the world, the lawyers said.\nThey asked Apple to respond to questions over its supply chain controls within three weeks and said they had compiled a report on \u201cthe laundering\u201d of Congo's minerals by Rwanda and private entities that would be made public this month.\nThey also would seek instructions from the Congo government as to what legal measures it is considering against Apple, the letter said.\n___\nAP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London and AP writer Saleh Mwanamilongo in Kinshasa, Congo, contributed to this report.___\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa\n"

        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\u00a0Top 5 Upgrades:\nHSBC double upgraded Snap (SNAP) to Buy from Reduce with a price target of $15.10, up from $10. The company reported a strong set of Q1 results, marked by return of double-digit growth, the analyst says.\nBarclays upgraded Enphase Energy (ENPH) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $134 price target, up from $115. Current share levels provide a \"reasonable entry point\" as de-stocking will be completed by the end of Q2 and demand is set to increase from trough levels throughout 2024, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nRaymond James upgraded Kratos Defense (KTOS) to Strong Buy from Outperform with a price target of $27, up from $20. Drones and air defense demand has accelerated with the ongoing and escalating conflicts globally, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nJPMorgan upgraded Dow Inc. (DOW) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $61, up from $55. The analyst says Dow is capable of outperforming because it is a beneficiary of higher oil prices, it has a \"durable\" 5% dividend yield, its value is sensitive to acceleration in global economic activity, and its downside risk is \"cushioned by the existence of global political tensions.\"\nBenchmark upgraded Western Digital (WDC) to Buy from Hold with an $85 price target. Western Digital produced \"major upside results\" driven by improving flash pricing and nearline drive sales, notes the analyst, who sees continued improvements in NAND pricing and nearline sales as 2024 progresses.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nErste Group downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Hold from Buy. Apple's growth momentum continues to slow and the company's new products do not currently have the potential to significantly improve sales momentum, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Mobileye (MBLY) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $25, down from $26. While the company's leadership in computer vision creates option value for new content growth, a surprise slowdown in electric vehicle adoption limits its total addressable market through 2030 amid aggressive competition, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nErste Group downgraded AMD (AMD) to Hold from Buy. The valuation is \"significantly higher than the P/E ratio of the peer group,\" as well as compared to \"much stronger competitor\" Nvidia (NVDA), the analyst tells investors.\nJPMorgan downgraded Boyd Gaming (BYD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $67, down from $80. The analyst says there is no way to sugarcoat Boyd's Q1 earnings miss as it was \"broad based and very surprising.\"\nBofA downgraded Hertz (HTZ) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $3, down from $9, telling investors that the company's Q1 results \"well below\" BofA and Street estimates failed to allay concerns about higher fleet costs that are unlikely to meaningfully subside in the near-term.\nTop 5 Initiations:\nB. Riley initiated coverage of MacroGenics (MGNX) with a Buy rating and $25 price target. The analyst views the company's most advanced candidate, vobra duo, as \"significantly de-risked\" in the ongoing over-enrolled Phase II TAMARACK registration-enabling study, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nScotiabank initiated coverage of Qualys (QLYS) with a Sector Perform rating and $172 price target. Qualys has \"a rock-solid reputation in vulnerability management,\" but \"the firm needs more than one string to its bow,\" the analyst tells investors.\nLadenburg initiated coverage of Spire (SR) with a Neutral rating and $57.50 price target. The firm believes that Spire's primary subsidiaries, Spire Alabama and Spire Missouri, are poised for continued growth due to favorable commissions and legislation.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Napco Security (NSSC) with a Buy rating and $52 price target. The firm says Napco has a \"powerful recurring revenue flywheel\" that was set in motion via its cellular connectivity radios.\nB. Riley resumed coverage of Full House Resorts (FLL) with a Buy rating and $9 price target. The analyst believes American Place's March EBITDA was over $3M, a $36M run-rate versus last year's $18.4M 11-month results.\n"

Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.Apple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple\u2019s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+82.5% vs. +61.1%). The company\u2019s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.

The company\u2019s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others.Lilly\u2019s new FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, are expected to be key top-line drivers. Lilly has also launched some other new products recently like Omvoh and Jaypirca. These new products are expected to drive Lilly\u2019s top line in 2024.Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Trulicity are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include American Tower Corp. and McKesson Corp.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Eric Sorensen, Ben Munson ",
        "Text": "Heineken is a huge multinational corporation and it\u2019s affected by market realities like supply and demand just like any other company. But when the answer to those issues is destroying an apple orchard, it\u2019s hard to see it as just business.\nHeineken owns Penrhos Orchard, a 300-acre site in Wales that was planted in 1997. The company said last year that it wants to sell that land because demand for cider has declined and left it with a \u201csurplus of apples.\u201d It said the apples grown in the orchard are bittersweet, meaning they have no use besides making cider. So Heineken, in line with the Wildlife Act, uprooted the entire orchard, which was the size of 140 football pitches (or soccer fields) and shredded all the wood for biomass.\nHow do you like them apples? Well, a lot of people don\u2019t like them at all.\nMost Read on IEN:\nReport: SpaceX Injuries Far Exceed Industry Average\nPODCAST: How to Sell Welding to Gen Z\nEPA Rule Bans Toxic Chemical Known to Cause Liver Cancer\nBoeing Company Expands to Make Parts for Stingrays, Red Hawks, Military Helicopters\nThe BBC spoke with ecologist Chris Formaggia, who said tearing up the orchard will have a big impact on wintering thrush species of birds who would use the orchard for shelter and foraging. WalesOnline rounded up comments from readers who blasted the move by Heineken, calling it a \u201chorrific act of violence\u201d and \u201cdisgusting behavior.\u201d\nHeineken defended its decision to chop down the apple trees and said it was \"incredibly important that we act responsibly and sustainably at all times.\" It also claimed that the amount of cider consumed in the UK has fallen by one-third in the past 10 years.\nHeineken owns cider brands including Bulmers, Strongbow and Orchard Thieves. The company reports its cider business results under the Beyond Beer tag, which also includes the company\u2019s ready-to-drink and wine options. Last week, the company said its Beyond Beer portfolio grew revenue by close to 10% during the first quarter, driven in part by a strong performance from Savanna, a cider brand it acquired as part of its tie-up with the Distell Group.\nThe UK is the world\u2019s biggest market for cider. The National Association of Cider Makers said UK cider represents 39% of the global market. So, any declines in that market would be especially felt by producers. And as the NACM pointed out, the amount of cider consumed has been steadily decreasing since 2009.\nStill, as Heineken is probably realizing, it\u2019s hard to chop down nearly half a square mile of apple trees and still have the public on your side.\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking manufacturing industry news.\n"

        "Author": "  Josh Ye ",
        "Text": "By Josh Ye\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Pavel Durov, billionaire founder and CEO of Telegram, said Apple's move last week to remove the chat app from its China app store had not caused any decrease in downloads from China and criticised Apple instead for its \"walled garden\" app policies.\nDurov published a post in his public channel on Telegram on Monday in which he confirmed that Apple removed multiple apps including Telegram from its App Store in China last week. Apple said the Chinese government ordered the removal, citing \"national security\" concerns presented by these apps.\nBut Durov said Beijing's action was not a move against Telegram but a move against Apple itself. Rather than taking issues with the Chinese regulators, Durov focused much of his post on criticising the iPhone maker, taking aim at Apple's app policies.\n\"Once again, Apple shot itself in the foot with its centralized 'walled garden' app policies,\" he said.\n\"Unlike iPhones, most Android phones allow sideloading apps outside app stores \u2014 such as the direct version of Telegram \u2014 so more users from China will migrate to Android...As a result of this change, the iPhone market share in China will keep shrinking.\"\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLast Friday, in addition to Telegram, Apple pulled WhatsApp, Meta's Threads and Signal from the App Store in China.\nApple's \"walled garden\" app policies, which reference Apple's long-time practice of not allowing iPhone users to install apps from any third-party app stores, have come under scrutiny in recent years.\nLast month, Apple was forced to start allowing alternative app stores on its devices in the European Union as the bloc's new Digital Markets Act bars the \"walled garden\" practice.\nUsers in China have to use proxy tools such as virtual private network (VPN) to bypass China's \"Great Firewall\" - the country's extensive cybersystem of censorship - to access Telegram. Durov said Telegram remained popular in China.\n\"Access to Telegram requires a VPN in China, but Chinese people are smart - they like Telegram and find a way to use it,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by David Evans)\n"

The statement coincided with the release by the law firm of a report accusing neighboring Rwanda of laundering tin, tungsten, tantalum \u2014 known as 3T minerals \u2014 and gold from Congo.\nRead More: Rwandan Meddling Is Deepening Congo\u2019s Deadly Conflict\n\u201cAlthough Apple has affirmed that it verifies the origins of minerals it uses to manufacture its products, those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence,\u201d Amsterdam said. \u201cThe world\u2019s eyes are wide shut: Rwanda\u2019s production of key 3T minerals is near zero, and yet big tech companies say their minerals are sourced in Rwanda.\u201d\nApple, which is known for rigidly policing its sprawling supply chain, has addressed accusations surrounding conflict minerals for years. The company disclosed back in 2016 that it began fully auditing its suppliers for the use of minerals linked to violent militia groups.\nThe US firm, which uses the minerals in its iPhones and other devices, referred a request for comment to a March filing in which the company said it was reasonably confident that none of its suppliers of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold financed or otherwise benefited armed groups in the region, though it did remove 14 smelters and refiners that didn\u2019t participate in an audit.\nIt also pledged to source \u201cresponsibly\u201d and work to improve working conditions among mining communities, including in Congo.\nRwanda\u2019s government didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment sent by text message. The East African nation is the world\u2019s largest producer of tantalum after Congo, according to the US Geological Society. It also has deposits of tin ore and tungsten ore.\nEastern Congo has been wracked by violence since the mid-1990s in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. Dozens of rebel groups are active in the region, fighting over land, economic resources and ethnic disputes. The conflict has displaced at least six million people.\nRwandan President Paul Kagame has long denied that his country benefits from what Congo claims is the $1 billion a year it loses from the smuggling of gold and other minerals through its eastern neighbor. United Nations experts also accuse elements of Congo\u2019s own army of profiting from the illicit trade in minerals from the region.\nThe US and European Union have laws discouraging companies from purchasing minerals linked to the conflict.\nCongo government spokesman Patrick Muyaya confirmed it had hired the team of lawyers.\n--With assistance from Edwin Chan, Loni Prinsloo, Michael J.

        "Author": "  John Csiszar ",
        "Text": "Over the long run, earnings drive stock prices, but in the short term, any number of factors can play a role \u2014 including who is sitting in the White House. Department of Justice investigations, trade policies and even casual comments directed at certain companies by a president can move markets and impact your investments. As Apple is the biggest company in the S&P 500, it plays a big role in the performance of the overall market. This makes it important to know what a president\u2019s policies toward Apple are.\nRead Next: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t SellCheck Out: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\nWhen it comes to how another Joe Biden presidency might affect your Apple investment, you can pick up a lot of clues from his first term. Since Biden has already tipped his hand over the past three-plus years, there\u2019s a lot of information available about how he might approach Apple over a potential second term. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nBiden officially took office on Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2021. As of the close of business on that day, Apple shares stood at $129.57. As of April 23, 2024, Apple shares closed at $166.90. That marks a return of 28.8% over about 3 1/4 years. Of course, this comes as Apple has had a rough start to 2024. The stock has been selling off since its 2024 peak of $195.18 on Jan. 23, almost two years to the day from Biden\u2019s inauguration. At that point, the stock had returned over 50% during the Biden administration.\nIn other words, Apple has performed quite well under the Biden administration, with the exception of its performance in 2024. Its recent underperformance can be attributed to a number of factors, many of which have nothing to do with President Biden. For the first time since 2019, for example, Apple has reported falling sales on a year-over-year basis for all four quarters of the last fiscal year. It also hasn\u2019t unveiled any new, ground-breaking products or even significantly upgraded its flagship iPhone. A slowing economy in China has also played a role.\nThe Biden administration can\u2019t be completely exonerated when it comes to struggles Apple may be having. On March 21 alone, for example, Apple shed $100 billion in market cap thanks to an antitrust lawsuit filed by Biden\u2019s Department of Justice. The essence of the suit is that Apple uses anti-competitive tactics to unfairly drive revenue. Specific grievances outlined in the suit include the following:\nBlocking innovative super apps\nSuppressing cloud gaming platforms\nExcluding cross-platform messaging apps\nLimiting the functionality of non-Apple smartwatches, helping to lock Apple Watch buyers into the iPhone and vice versa\nLimiting the third-party payment capabilities, privileging Apple Pay competitors like PayPal\nIf the government wins its case, punishments could include anything from a large fine to forcing Apple to alter how it does business. This latter case would be the most damaging to the company going forward. However, many pundits feel there isn\u2019t really much of a case against Apple, including the chairman of Forbes Media, Steve Forbes.\nIf you\u2019re investing in any stock, including Apple, you should have a long-term view. Most advisors suggest that means at least five years \u2014 or longer than a single presidential term. In that sense, it may be more fruitful to think of Apple in terms of its products, earnings and strategic plan rather than who is in the White House in 2025. However, it is true that presidents can enact policies that can affect earnings, whether through trade wars, antitrust lawsuits or other actions.\nThe Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust lawsuit could certainly be a headwind for Apple going forward, and a negative outcome could certainly hurt the company. But the results of this suit may not be known for years, and the stock\u2019s performance YTD in 2024 reflects some of this potential bad news.\nThings could actually be even worse if Biden loses the presidency. If Biden falls in the November election, it means former President Donald Trump will win a second term, and he is famously anti-China when it comes to trade policies. If tariffs and other trade actions were implemented again under Trump, Apple could suffer. Portfolio Wealth Advisors president Lee Munson told Yahoo Finance Live, \u201cBiden has not been friendly to China, but Trump\u2019s going to be even worse.\u201d\nInterest rates and taxes are other factors to consider regarding Biden and Apple. Biden will likely keep taxes higher than Trump, according to analysts at TD Securities, and this could hurt corporate profits in general, including Apple\u2019s. But the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates in late 2024 and into 2025, and inflation has been falling. These could both be tailwinds for stocks like Apple.\nThe bottom line is that there are a number of factors that could influence the trajectory of Apple\u2019s stock, and Biden\u2019s influence might be minimal. It\u2019s best to have a long-term view and look at the whole picture, including revenue, earnings, interest rates and product development, to determine what to do with your Apple stock.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Expensive Costco Items That Are Definitely Worth the Cost\n5 Unnecessary Bills You Should Stop Paying in 2024\n5 Reasons You Should Consider an Annuity For Your Retirement Savings\n10 New Cars to Avoid Buying in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Another Biden Presidency Might Affect Your Apple Investment\n"

        "Text": "Apple\u2019s iPad will face heightened regulation in the European Union after officials labeled its operating system Monday as a key gatekeeper technology under EU competition law.\nThe European Commission\u2019s formal designation of iPadOS subjects it to tough rules applied to only a handful of other digital platforms controlled by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.\nThe stricter regulations require, for example, that the iPad not restrict third-party companies from accessing Apple services. And they prohibit Apple from giving its own services preferential treatment on the iPad compared to those offered by competitors. Violations can lead to hefty fines of up to 10% of a company\u2019s global annual revenue. That could mean tens of billions of dollars in potential fines for Apple, which reported $383.3 billion in revenue last year.\nApple is already subject to European gatekeeper obligations on iOS and in its app store and browser. But this move, telegraphed last fall when the European Commission launched a study of iPadOS, puts even more of the technology giant\u2019s business under the EU\u2019s microscope.\nApple will have six months to comply with the new iPad-related obligations.\nIn a statement, Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission\u2019s top competition official, said iPadOS didn\u2019t meet the statutory size or revenue thresholds that typically qualify a platform for gatekeeper status.\nStill, she said, \u201ciPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers.\u201d\n\u201cThe Digital Markets Act is a dynamic tool which allows us to tackle the realities of digital markets,\u201d Vestager added.\n\u201cWe will continue to constructively engage with the European Commission to comply with the DMA, across all designated services,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cOur focus will remain on delivering the very best products and services to our European customers, while mitigating the new privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users.\u201d\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

These are the ETFs which track the performance of the S&P 500 index.\nBuying the indexes has become a popular way to invest for many, with it even being endorsed by the greatest living investor, Warren Buffett.\nBut which S&P 500 ETF do you buy?\nTracey and Neena cut through all the noise to bring you the basics.\nOne of the biggest contributing factors as to which S&P 500 ETF you will buy is the expense ratio. You may not think it matters whether an ETF charges you 0.09% or 0.02%, but over 20 or 30 years, those little amounts really add up and can hit your performance.\nThe lower the expense ratio, the better. And thankfully, ETF providers have been in a competition to find out which provider could provide the cheapest index ETFs so the expense ratios keep going lower.\n1. SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF is the oldest of the S&P 500 index ETFs and it's the largest, in terms of assets.\nBut SPY is also the most expensive. It has an expense ratio of 0.095%. Because of its liquidity, SPY has been favored by traders, and less by investors.\nIf you are a long-term investor, you should consider investing in one of the cheaper indexes.\n2. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is so popular with investors that most just refer to it by its ticker: the VOO.\nFor years, VOO was the cheapest of the big S&P 500 ETFs. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%.\nThe VOO is often offered in many 401ks and many investors buy it for their own IRA accounts.\nBut VOO no longer the \"cheapest\" of the ETFs. Should you still buy it?\n3. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG\nThe SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF is a newer ETF with just a few years on the market. State Street saw that it's flagship SPY was losing some steam with long term investors who wanted a lower expense ratio, so it created SPLG.\nSPLG tracks the same index as the others but it has an even lower expense ratio of just 0.02%. If you are a long-term investor looking for the cheapest way to buy and hold the S&P 500, then SPLG should be on your short list.\nAll 3 ETFs Hold the Same Top Stocks\n1. Microsoft Corp. MSFT\nBecause all three are tracking the same S&P 500 index, they all own the same top 10 stocks. Microsoft is the largest holding in the market cap S&P 500 index. Microsoft is 7.09% of the index.\nMicrosoft has been on a tear, rising 42.6% in the last year. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has gained 22.7% during that time.\nIf you own the S&P 500, you will own a position in Microsoft.\n2. Apple Inc. AAPL\nApple is the second largest position in the S&P 500, at 5.64%. But instead of being a boost to the index this year, it has held it back.\nApple shares are up only 1.1% over the last year, underperforming the S&P 500 index, which has gained 22.7% during that time.\nThis underperformance is why investors like to own indexes. They get a bucket of stocks that can help smooth out rough times in a single position.\nMany investors like owning the S&P 500 index because of this big concentration in Apple.\nWhat Else Should You Know About the Best S&P 500 ETFs? \nTune into this week's video podcast to find out.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

However, another company might be poised to join the ranks within the next decade.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is an emerging challenger to Nvidia in the market for AI chips. The company is valued at just $270 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could see a gain of 270% if it does eventually join the trillion-dollar club. Here's why I think it will.\nLast year AMD unveiled its MI300 lineup of data center chips designed to process AI workloads. They come in two configurations: The MI300X is a pure GPU that competes with Nvidia's H100, and the MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to form an accelerated processing unit (APU).\nConsidering Nvidia can't keep up with demand for its chips, the door is open for competitors like AMD to snatch market share. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), AMD told investors it was working with tech giants like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta on MI300 GPU deployments for AI. Microsoft has already begun private previews with customers for the MI300X on its Azure cloud computing platform, where developers can access advanced AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\nAMD predicts the MI300 series could attract $3.5 billion in sales in 2024. That forecast was revised higher from $2 billion just three months earlier, which speaks to how quickly demand is building. Nvidia did $47.5 billion in data center revenue last fiscal year, driven mostly by its H100, so there is still plenty of room for AMD to grow.\nHowever, AMD's opportunity in AI transcends the data center. It already has a 90% market share in chips for AI-enabled personal computers, led by its Ryzen AI series, which includes CPUs, GPUs, and neural processing units (NPUs). The company says millions of AI PCs have already shipped with those chips, from manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and HP Inc.\nProcessing AI on-device results in a faster user experience, because workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center. That allows computers to host advanced virtual assistants capable of creating text content, images, and videos potentially without any network connection. Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year during Q4, and investors should watch for more rapid growth in the upcoming first quarter of 2024.\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, which means growth is sometimes lumpy from year to year. Consumers don't upgrade expensive products like computers and smartphones annually, which leads to an occasional lull in revenue growth for companies like AMD.\nFor example, AMD's revenue soared 44% in 2022 to $23.6 billion, but it came in at $22.7 billion in 2023, which was a 4% year-over-year decline. High inflation and rising interest rates didn't help, because they piled additional pressure on consumer spending.\nCommercial spending on the data center presents the same challenge. Tech giants like Microsoft normally don't upgrade their hardware every year; however, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will change that in the near term. He says $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure will be upgraded within four years to meet demand for accelerated computing and AI, which could drive a significant growth cycle for his company and the likes of AMD.\nWall Street analysts are forecasting $25.8 billion in 2024 revenue for AMD, which will represent growth of 14%. They also predict $32.5 billion in 2025 revenue, which would be an accelerated growth rate of 26%. However, considering AMD recently lifted its own forecast for MI300 sales by such a wide margin, combined with its soaring sales in AI-enabled computer chips, it's possible the company blows Wall Street's numbers out of the water.\nAfter all, Nvidia routinely beats expectations in the data center, and AMD's MI300 sales are only just starting to ramp up.\nAMD is currently valued at $270 billion, and based on its $22.7 billion in 2023 revenue, its stock trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. If that P/S ratio remains constant, AMD will have to generate $84 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation.\nThe company could get there within a decade if it grows revenue by a relatively modest 14% each year between now and 2034. AMD appears likely to meet the threshold comfortably in the near term based on the Street's forecasts for 2024 and 2025.\nPlus, despite the lumpiness in its yearly results, AMD's revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 15.6% over the last 10 years -- and that's without AI, which could be the company's largest opportunity ever.\nMultiple expansion is also a possibility. If AMD's revenue grows much faster than analysts expect, investors could be willing to pay a higher P/S ratio for the stock. Nvidia stock, for example, trades at a P/S ratio of 35.8 -- triple where AMD stock is trading. That would accelerate the company's path to a $1 trillion valuation.\nAMD is a very likely candidate to join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the trillion-dollar club, and investors who buy the stock today could earn a significant gain when it gets there.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

Future releases will support MacOS, and iPadOS.\nV5G enables 5G service on any generation phone, on any network, any provider and now, any Smartphone platform operating system.\nInitially engineered to run on Android, Virtual 5G service delivered through V5GE is now available on Apple platforms. V5GE is already in Global pre-GA (General Availability) release through the Apple Developer Program.\nApple \nAfter not being in the Top 10 for years, Apple briefly became #1 in the world in Smartphone sales in terms of units shipped, currently holding #2 (1st Quarter 2024). Given this increase in market share, Virtual Internet determined it is the right time to extend the V5G Global Network to Apple users.\niOS\nThe iPhone is Apple's largest selling product. Apple (non-Android Phones) comprise 20% \u00b1 of the global market and approximately 80% of the World is on Android.\nThe selection of iOS as the initial support for Apple was made because Apple is engineering macOS and iPadOS to be closer in both look and operation to iOS.\n5G service is a function of the network, not just the phone. New iPhones typically focus on features (e.g. cameras) that are specific to the device. This is why it is an opportune moment for iPhone users to have access to the Worlds Leading 5G Global Enhanced Mobile Broadband Network.\nCar Play and Android Auto\nV5G has already been engineered to work on Android Auto. Apple Car Play has been similarly designed to work as an option alongside Android Auto in automobiles. V5GE is purposefully designed to provide enhanced service over Apple, a service that devices makers and Smartphone Operating systems by themselves cannot deliver.\nWith Net Neutrality (ISPs cannot provide service enhancement for specific sites or services) \u00a0now a global policy, practice and unintentional reality, Virtual Internet's Global 5G Service is uniquely able to provide enhanced service delivery for partner Apps, distribution partners, and for Virtual Internet App Users.\nAbout Virtual Internet Pte.

        "Author": "  Josh Xiao and Sarah Zheng ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Now that President Joe Biden has signed off on a law that could expel TikTok from the US market, Beijing must decide how best to retaliate over an attack on the world\u2019s most-valuable start-up.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMusk Leaves China With Tesla Driving Software Hurdles Cleared\nMusk Makes Surprise China Visit in Search of Tesla Revenue Boost\nElliott Built \u2018Large\u2019 Stake in Buffett-Favored Sumitomo, Source Says\nYen Watchers Ask When Japan Will Step In as Slide Accelerates\nYen Rebounds Strongly After First Slide Past 160 Since 1990\nThe legislation approved on Wednesday would give Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. nearly a year to divest the video-sharing platform before facing an outright ban. At a daily briefing hours before, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry directed reporters to a previous vow by commerce officials to take \u201cmeasures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s government has so far shown restraint in responding to a drumbeat of US trade curbs during a hawkish election season. The Communist Party\u2019s moderation has been made easier by Biden\u2019s choice of largely symbolic actions, such as tariffs on metals China exports little of to America.\nDriving TikTok \u2014 or its Chinese owner \u2014 out of the US could challenge that calibration, making American firms with large exposure to China\u2019s market, including Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc., potential targets for retaliation. Officials last year displayed their willingness to respond in kind to a US campaign to kneecap Beijing\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, for example, by launching a probe into American memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc.\n\u201cChina is keeping options open at the moment,\u201d said Xiaomeng Lu, director of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group. But she said if TikTok exhausts its legal options and has to exit America, \u201csome US tech brands could be at risk of becoming the collateral damage of this tit-for-tat cycle.\u201d\nBeijing\u2019s internet restrictions have already forced most American social media firms out of the Chinese market, such as Meta Platforms Inc. and Snap Inc., narrowing the list of potential targets for a tit-for-tat response. Any Chinese action would likely try to avoid inflicting harm on its own economy, as policymakers battle a property crisis that\u2019s weighing on growth along with weak domestic demand.\nThe ratcheting up of trade tensions comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in China this week to press US concerns about Chinese companies\u2019 support for Russia\u2019s war machine. The Biden administration has threatened Beijing with sanctions on its banks if they bolster the Kremlin\u2019s campaign in Ukraine, a move that risks hurting US cooperation with China in other geopolitical hot spots such as the Middle East and North Korea.\nAnother consideration would be the optics, after foreign investment into China slumped to a 30-year low in 2023. Xi traveled to San Francisco to woo American CEOs in November and rolled out the red carpet for executives in Beijing this year, as officials ramp up efforts to boost sentiment.\n\u201cIf they sanction US companies this could intensify American firms\u2019 concerns about operating in there,\u201d said Wei Zongyou, a professor in American security and foreign policy at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cThat means the likelihood of taking further restrictions and sanctions on companies in China is not that big.\u201d\nStill, China has other, less well-documented weapons at its disposal \u2014 including restricting US access to the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, a persistent point of friction between Beijing and Washington.\nChinese agencies and government-backed firms ordered staff to stop bringing iPhones and other foreign devices to work last year, in an unprecedented prohibition that\u2019s likely to clip Apple sales in China. Tesla Inc.\u2019s electric vehicles are already subject to restrictions in government compounds, due to concerns about data being collected by the cameras built into the cars.\nThe danger is Beijing will ratchet up semi-official moratoriums on the use of American hardware, potentially pressuring companies like Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. Many major firms operate influential lobbies in the US and have been known to oppose broader American sanctions for fear of losing market access.\nIntel was forced to walk away from its $5.4 billion takeover of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. last year after failing to win Chinese regulatory approval in time, a move seen by some in Washington as a response to Biden\u2019s sweeping chip curbs.\nWhile Xi has a long-term objective for tech independence, alienating foreign firms in that sector would only slow China\u2019s development, according to Li Mingjiang, associate professor at Nanyang Technological University\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. \u201cWhat China wants now is to reduce tech decoupling with the US,\u201d he said. \u201cPunishing a US tech company will not be helpful for this purpose.\u201d\nThe most likely immediate action China will take is trying to prevent TikTok being sold to an American entity. Beijing could leverage export controls it imposed in 2020 over content-regulation algorithms, which are the heart of the platform\u2019s global success \u2014 a move that would force ByteDance to exit the US market rather than acquiesce to a sale.\nThe company itself has said it would take legal action if the bill is signed into law. That would see the platform rely on the First Amendment argument, as it has done to fend off a state ban in Montana, in an effort that could span years.\nIn another twist, Biden\u2019s challenger Donald Trump \u2014 who previously tried to ban the app while in the White House \u2014 could end up giving the platform a reprieve, if he wins the November election. The former US president has raised concerns banning TikTok would elevate its rival Meta.\nFor now, Beijing has to wait to see how the US election plays out, said Zhu Feng, executive dean of Nanjing University\u2019s School of International Studies, highlighting that the legislation has an impact on both nations.\nThis kind of ban doesn\u2019t only hurt China, he added, \u201cit hurts the 170 million American users of this app.\u201d\n--With assistance from James Mayger.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy\nBiden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts\nTesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes\nCaught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-04-15, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.47. It's currently trading at a price of $176.565. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -13.57%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.42\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n83.3\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n72.17\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n155.47\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $143.19. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -23.31%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Soni\n(Reuters) -Tesla has settled a lawsuit over a 2018 car crash that killed an Apple engineer after his Model X, operating on Autopilot, swerved off a highway near San Francisco, court documents showed on Monday.\nThe settlement was made on the eve of the trial over the high-profile accident involving Tesla's driver-assistant technology. Tesla faces a series of lawsuits over crashes related to the alleged use of Autopilot, putting the automaker at risk of large monetary judgments and reputational damage.\nThe settlement, the terms of which were not disclosed, came as Chief Executive Elon Musk is making major promotions of self-driving technology, which he has touted as key to the financial future of the world's most valuable automaker.\nThe 2018 accident killed 38-year-old Walter Huang. His family had alleged that Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier. Plaintiffs' lawyers asked a Tesla witness whether the company knew drivers would not watch the road when using its driver-assistance system, Reuters reported last month citing deposition transcripts.\nTesla had contended that Huang misused the Autopilot system because he was playing a video game just before the accident.\nHuang's lawyer and Tesla were not available for comment.\nThe crash that killed Huang is among hundreds of U.S. accidents in which Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators.\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has examined at least 956 crashes in which Autopilot was initially reported to have been in use. The agency separately launched more than 40 investigations into accidents involving Tesla automated-driving systems that resulted in 23 deaths.\n\"It is striking to me that Tesla decided to go this far publicly and then settle,\" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina with expertise in autonomous vehicle law. \"What this does do, though, is it says to other attorneys, we might settle. We might not always fight it. That is the signal.\"\nThe case follows two previous California trials over Autopilot that Tesla won by arguing the drivers involved had not heeded its instructions to maintain attention while using the system.\nTesla has yet to prove it can produce an autonomous car despite years of predictions by co-founder and CEO Musk that one was just around the corner, an expectation that partly underpinned Tesla's soaring valuation.\nMusk said on Friday that Tesla plans to unveil a self-driving robotaxi on Aug. 8, after Reuters reported that Tesla scrapped an inexpensive car plan in favor of robotaxis.\nHe also said last month that Tesla will offer U.S. customers a month's free trial of its driver-assist technology, Full Self-Driving.\nAny negative publicity threatens to hurt the reputation of Tesla at a time when the company is battling weakening sales and reputational damage caused by certain controversial comments from Musk, said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid.\n\"The last thing they would want right now is to have a public trial showing all of the problems with Full Self-Driving,\" he added.\nTesla says Autopilot can match speed to surrounding traffic and navigate within a highway lane. The step-up \"enhanced\" Autopilot, which costs $6,000, adds automated lane-changes, highway ramp navigation and self-parking features. The $12,000 Full Self-Driving option adds automated features for city streets, such as stop-light recognition.\nTesla materials explaining the systems warn that it does not make the car autonomous and requires a \"fully attentive driver\" who can \"take over at any moment.\"\nMusk said in a social media post in 2022: \"We will never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose.\"\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri, Lisa Shumaker, Leslie Adler and Himani Sarkar)\n"

        "Author": "  Megan Cerullo ",
        "Text": "Do you use Apple Pay or another mobile payment service to make purchases? If so, you could be spending more than if you relied on a physical credit card or cash.\nServices like Google Pay and China-based Alipay that let you pay by hovering your phone over a terminal and clicking a button can lead to consumers spending more money than they otherwise would, largely driven by how easy the systems make it to buy things, new research\u00a0shows. \nThe ease and convenience of tapping to pay leads consumers to spend more compared to when they paid by credit card, according to the study, which was led by Yuqian Zu, assistant professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nStudying payment activities from a leading bank in Asia before and after the launch of Alipay, the largest mobile payment platform, researchers found that the mobile payment service led to greater spending.\nHow much more do people spend with their phones?\nConsumers both spent more money and made more purchases when tapping to pay. The researchers found that customers charged 9.4% more on average to their credit cards both online and in person after they started making mobile payments. They also made more purchases.\nMobile phone payments are convenient in more way than one. First, transactions are quicker, taking an average of 29 seconds, versus 40 seconds when paying with a physical credit or debit card, according to the study.\n\"This swift transaction speed contributes significantly to the overall convenience experienced by users,\" Zu told CBS MoneyWatch.\nSecond, mobile payments mean consumers don't need to carry wallets or purses. Many people believe this makes commercial activities more secure.\n\"This aspect alone can enhance the perceived security of payments for consumers,\" Zu said. \"You don't need to present a card with numbers. And also by eliminating the need for a physical card, mobile payment systems streamline the transaction process and provides a sense of ease and security for users.\"\nWhile the study doesn't examine the issue, Zu also thinks the ease of mobile payments can lead to consumers racking up more debt.\n\"I personally think this could be a factor that contributes because people are spending more,\" she said.\nZu isn't suggesting we turn our off our phones or delete payment apps to avoid overspending. But she thinks it's important that consumers be aware of the potential behavioral changes that mobile payment services may facilitate, including a tendency to spend with less restraint.\n\"The findings are very important for the general population to know about \u2014 that with convenience, it's possible you may spend more,\" she said.\nThat includes impulsive spending at checkout registers and online, where consumers can securely store their credit card information.\n\"Because of the convenience, you don't even notice you bought things,\" she said. Just keeping this in mind can help consumers \"better manage their financial resources and reduce impulsive expenditures.\"\nNASA to launch rockets into total solar eclipse path\nThief says he tried on, then melted down Yogi Berra World Series rings | 60 Minutes\nTotal solar eclipse cuts path across U.S.\n"
