        "Text": "Apple is about to get a new secret weapon that could lead to some juicy returns for investors: AI-focused phones. Bank of America analysts call them \u201cIntelliPhones,\u201d and in a Wednesday note, they argued that these high-powered devices will be an entirely new breed compared to the current raft of smartphones.\nSenior equity research analyst Wamsi Mohan and his team described a future where phones will need far more computing power in order to handle the daily use of \u201cAI agents\u201d that will help with everything from booking travel and real-time translation to scheduling and tutoring. For Apple and its installed base of over 2.2 billion active smartphones, that means a massive opportunity to sell customers on the latest and greatest AI tech.\n\u201cWe see the introduction of AI smartphones (IntelliPhones) as a once in a decade upgrade event,\u201d Mohan and his team wrote, forecasting \u201ca multi-year upgrade cycle similar to the step function improvement driven by the introduction of smartphones.\u201d\nIntelliPhones are set to offer a new experience for consumers that smartphones won\u2019t be able to compete with, including augmented and virtual reality experiences, health monitoring, and more, according to BofA\u2019s analysts. \u201cAs AI technology evolves the gap between IntelliPhones and traditional smartphones is likely to widen further by offering even more sophisticated and personalized functions driving the desire to upgrade,\u201d they wrote.\nShares of Apple have risen just over 7% during the past 12 months, lagging compared to the S&P 500, and particularly, the soaring big tech sector. But with the era of AI-enabled phones on the horizon, Bank of America analysts expect a turnaround. Mohan and his team reiterated their \u201cbuy\u201d rating and a $230 price target on shares of Apple Wednesday. It\u2019s an outlook that represents a potential 20% gain for Apple investors over the next 12 months, but that rise would also leave the Cupertino-based tech giant with a lofty valuation of 30 times its fiscal year 2025 earnings.\nStill, Mohan and his team said that they believe that higher valuation \u201cis justified given a multi-year [iPhone] upgrade cycle, large cash balance and opportunity to diversify into new end markets, increasing mix and diversity of services.\u201d\n\u201cWe see IntelliPhones dominating edge AI, as compared to AI PCs, given their portability, features and cost,\u201d he added.\nOne of the keys to the success of IntelliPhones will be AI developers, according to Bank of America. Mohan and his team said they believe that developers will build AI agents that will run on Apple\u2019s phones, creating \u201ca new layer of monetization\u201d for the company.\nThe comments echo the AI optimism that CEO Tim Cook described in Apple\u2019s May 2 earnings call. \u201cWe believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple\u2019s unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration, groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry-leading neural engines, and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create,\u201d he said.\nCFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino also maintained his \u201cbuy\u201d rating on shares of Apple Tuesday, citing improved iPhone sales prospects in China due to the company\u2019s AI push. After iPhone sales in China wavered in 2022 and 2023 amid rising geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and increased domestic competition, Apple managed to turn things around in April. iPhone sales jumped 52% from a year ago to 3.5 million units last month, and Zino believes Apple\u2019s AI ambitions are likely to kickstart more growth.\n\u201cAAPL's ambitions towards greater AI capabilities ahead of the iPhone 16 launch this fall should appeal to China consumers and also better position it at the high-end of the market,\u201d he wrote.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Widely followed Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi put out a new report on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) on Monday. The Bernstein analyst had recommended investors just hold shares in the iPhone maker. Now, ahead of its quarterly earnings report expected later this week, Sacconaghi says it's time to buy Apple stock.\nThe analyst's \"outperform\" rating comes with a price target of $195 for Apple. That's a gain of nearly 15% over the next 12 months from Tuesday's closing price.\nApple hasn't been a standout among technology stocks this year. Shares are down nearly 12% year to date. That has come about as investors fear growth is slowing and interest in its latest iPhone offering has been lackluster.\nBut the Bernstein analyst says that's exactly why investors should now \"buy the fear\" in Apple. Sacconaghi thinks weakness in the large Chinese market is just part of the product cycle and is not structural in nature. And that fear has also led to low expectations from Apple with its fiscal second-quarter results due to be reported on Thursday, May 2.\nBut investors shouldn't worry about whether Apple stock pops or drops when it reports quarterly earnings. The stock should be owned based on its financial and business fundamentals. One reason is that regardless of the short-term stock movement, investors will be rewarded with a dividend payment. Other popular big tech companies Meta Platforms and Alphabet recently initiated dividends. But Apple has been paying shareholders over the past decade. And with more than $170 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet as of Dec. 30, 2023, there's little danger of a cut in the dividend.\nEven if the stock drops after earnings, the long-term picture still looks bright. Apple will inevitably continue to release new products and services. Regarding product offerings, Sacconaghi and his team also noted that \"replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI (artificial intelligence) features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle.\" That'd be more good news for investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Exchange-traded funds holding Apple Inc. moved higher Friday after the iPhone maker reported first quarter results that exceeded expectations and announced a $110 billion share buyback.\nShares of Cupertino, California-based Apple jumped around 7%. Apple reported it earned $1.53 per share, beating the estimate of $1.51, while revenues of $90.8 billion beat the $90.4 billion expectation.\nThe stock was also supported by the company's announcement that it would buy back an additional $110 billion worth of shares. That was more than the $90 billion in buybacks the company had announced in recent years.\nRevenues for Apple have fallen year-over-year in five of the past six quarters, but investors were assuaged by comments from Apple that indicated growth in the low single digits for Q2.\nApple is held by 458 exchange-traded funds, including big weightings in many tech ETFs like the $63 billion Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and the $62 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which allocate over a fifth of their portfolios to the stock. The stock also has a hefty 8.5% weighting in the popular $250 billion Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). All of those funds rose today.\nFor aggressive traders who want more concentrated exposure to Apple, the $60 million Direxion Daily AAPL Bull 2X Shares (AAPU) offers just that. That fund jumped 13% midday Friday, twice the gain for shares of Apple.\nExpectations were low for Apple ahead of the release of its first quarter earnings report. The stock was down by 10% since the start of the year, sharply lagging the S&P 500\u2019s 6.2% return.\nAfter today\u2019s jump, Apple\u2019s losses have been cut to 4%.\nIndustry channel checks had suggested that the iPhone had lost significant market share in China.\nBut even though Apple\u2019s China revenue dropped 8% from a year ago in Q1, the company attributed it to a drop in sales of other products\u2014not the iPhone.\nApple CEO Tim Cook noted that iPhone revenues in China actually increased, which was a relief for investors. \n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Earnings season is in full swing, and all eyes are on the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) just hit the earnings tape with one major headline: a $110 billion stock buyback authorization. This is a notable announcement, as it marks the largest share buyback in U.S. corporate history.\nLet's break down why stock buybacks are important, and analyze some of the other themes of Apple's earnings. After a thorough review of the report, you may want to think twice before scooping up shares of the iPhone maker.\nThe chart below illustrates Apple's stock buyback history over the last 10 years. Clearly, the company has done a stellar job returning capital to investors through a series of consistent stock buybacks:\nOne of the biggest reasons a company may purchase its own shares is because management views the stock as undervalued.\nA more subtle reason why a company may repurchase stock is to increase earnings per share (EPS). This is where one of my suspicions and concerns comes into play.\nBelow is a summary of Apple's annual revenue growth over the last several quarters:\nQuarter ended Dec. 31, 2022: negative 5%\nQuarter ended April 1, 2023: negative 3%\nQuarter ended July 1, 2023: negative 1%\nQuarter ended Sept. 30, 2023: negative 1%\nQuarter ended Dec. 30, 2023: 2%\nQuarter ended March 30, 2024: negative 4%\nFor more than a year, Apple has consistently experienced a year-over-year revenue drop -- with the lone exception being the holiday season at the end of last year.\nWhile a challenging macroeconomic picture with lingering inflation and rising borrowing costs is playing some role in Apple's struggles, there are deeper issues at hand. Specifically, Apple's business in China -- one of its biggest markets -- is decelerating.\nFor the period ended March 30, Apple's revenue in China dropped 8% year over year to $16.4 billion. Much of this was attributable to a stalling iPhone segment, which dropped 10% year over year to $45.9 billion in all countries.\nConsidering that the iPhone is Apple's biggest source of revenue, and China is one of the company's core markets, the combination of decelerating growth in both areas doesn't exactly spell confidence for investors.\nAs sales continue to fall and as Apple remains silent about its ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI), it will become harder for the company to generate strong earnings power.\nRight now, Apple trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28 -- considerably higher than the S&P 500's forward P/E of 20.\nMany of Apple's megacap peers have made notable strides in AI and are already seeing new waves of growth. Apple's silence on this issue is perplexing, and adds to my suspicion that the company is at a crossroads and can't seem to decide on a direction. Therefore, the stock's valuation premium isn't really warranted, in my opinion.\nThe company has over $160 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. So the latest buyback plan looks like an excuse to deploy some capital to distract investors from a consistently declining revenue base and an unclear AI vision.\nWhile Apple could surprise the market with a turnaround, I'm not overly confident that'll come anytime soon. I'd stay clear of Apple right now. The stock looks pricey, and there are better opportunities for growth investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Judge grills Apple exec about whether company is defying order to enable more iPhone payment options",
        "Author": "  MICHAEL LIEDTKE ",
        "Text": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday questioned whether Apple has set up a gauntlet of exasperating hurdles to discourage the use of alternative payment options in iPhone apps, despite a court order seeking to create more ways for consumers to pay for digital services.\nThe verbal sparring between Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers and the head of Apple's app store kicked off a hearing focused on whether Apple is still steering U.S. consumers to its once-exclusive app payment system in defiance of an injunction aimed at promoting more choices that could help lower prices.\nGonzalez Rogers' order requires Apple to allow app developers to display links to other options besides the company's own payment system in the U.S. Apple makes billions of dollars annually from that setup, which imposes commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within the most popular iPhone apps.\nApple's app store and its commission system also is being targeted in another antitrust case recently filed by the U.S. Justice Department in a case alleging the iPhone walls off competition in a variety of ways that stifle competition and innovation.\nGonzalez Rogers often sounded frustrated and skeptical as she periodically chimed in during four hours of testimony from Matthew Fischer, the Apple executive in charge of the iPhone app store.\nThe tone of the judge's questions indicated she is concerned Apple's efforts to comply with her order have been primarily designed to protect the company's profits instead of making it easier for iPhone users to switch to other in-app payment options, as she intended.\nGonzalez Rogers was particularly pointed as she grilled Fischer about whether Apple had deliberately made it more cumbersome and confusing for consumers to make digital purchases through alternative services.\n\u201cOther than to stifle competition, I can see no other answer,\u201d the judge said as she tried to dissect the rationale for Apple's design of alternative payment option system for iPhone apps.\nFischer maintained Apple is complying with the judge's order while still trying to shield iPhone users from bad actors on the internet and enabling the Cupertino, California, company to reap a return on its investments in the app store and other mobile software.\nToward that end, Apple has introduced a new commission structure ranging from 12% to 27% on digital transactions initiated from within an app and completed on an alternative payment option. After Gonzalez Rogers said it sounded like Apple was still collecting a \u201cwindfall,\u201d Fischer said the company expected its effective commission rate on digital transactions processed by alternative payment options to be about 18%.\n\u201cWe are running a business,\u201d Fischer said.\nApple spent more than two years trying to overturn the order that Gonzalez Rogers issued as part of a broader antitrust battle that the company won. The injunction requiring Apple to allow links to alternative app payments took effect in January after U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case.\nBut Fischer disclosed Wednesday that Apple so far has only received and approved applications to display links to alternative payment systems from 38 apps so far \u2014 a fraction of the roughly 2 million iPhone apps available in the U.S. Fischer couldn't specify how many of those apps engage in digital transactions when asked by Gonzalez Rogers, who ordered Apple to provide the number as the proceedings progress this month.\nVideo game Epic Games cites the muted interest in applying for in-app links to alternative payment options as evidence that Apple was still rigging the system in its favor.\nEpic, maker of the popular Fortnite video game, is trying to force Apple to make more sweeping changes to accommodate alternative payment options after it unsuccessfully tried to persuade Gonzalez Rogers that the iPhone app store had turned into a price-gouging monopoly during a 2021 trial.\nThe effort is being supported by Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms, Elon Musk\u2019s X short-messaging service, music streaming service Spotify and long-time Apple rival Microsoft.\nApple\u2019s current alternative payment formula \u201cis guaranteed to continue extracting excessive commissions from developers\u201d while also blocking them from steering consumers to other places where they could buy the same digital services for lower prices, Epic asserted in documents leading up to Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\nIn its own pre-hearing briefs, Apple accused Epic of trying to get Gonzalez Rogers to micromanage its business in ways designed to boost the video game maker\u2019s profits.\n\u201cEpic has repeatedly made clear that what it wants is access to and use of Apple\u2019s tools and technologies without having to pay for them,\" Apple argued.\nThe court hearings are scheduled to resume Friday when another top Apple executive, Phil Schiller, is expected to testify. Gonzalez Rogers hopes to wrap up the hearings by May 17, but told lawyers Wednesday it might take longer than that.\n"

        "Title": "Apple Unveiled a Historic $110 Billion Stock Buyback, but Is It the Right Move?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) climbed higher after the iPhone maker announced a huge $110 billion share repurchase program in conjunction with its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. While the stock popped on the news, the question is whether this is the best use of cash for Apple investors over the long run.\nLet's look at the company's quarterly results and its buyback plans.\nThe most recent quarterly results featured a 4% decline in sales to $90.8 billion.\nProduct sales were down nearly 10% to $66.9 billion as a segment, with iPhone revenue falling 10% to $46 billion, and iPad sales plunging 17% to $5.6 billion. Wearable and home devices saw a decline of 10% to $7.9 million despite the launch of its newest product, the Vision Pro headset. Mac revenue rose 4% to $7.5 million.\nServices was a bright spot, with revenue from this segment climbing 14% to $23.9 billion. The company highlighted strong results from Apple TV+ and Apple Sports.\nChina remained a trouble spot, with overall sales down 8% to $16.4 billion. But the company said iPhone sales in that country did increase. There were worries that the iPhone has been losing market share in China to local rivals such as Huawei, which has led to discounts there, so this was good news.\nApple sees better days ahead, guiding for third-quarter sales to rise by low single digits despite currency headwinds. It is looking for services revenue to grow at a similar double-digit rate as in the first half of the year, and for iPad sales to rebound and grow by double digits.\nThe second-quarter results did little to excite investors, but the announcement of a $110 billion repurchase plan was met with enthusiasm. It is the company's largest buyback authorization in history, topping a previous $100 billion buyback in 2018.\nApple has already been repurchasing its stock, including $23.5 billion worth in the second quarter. So if it completes its repurchase program over the next year, it will quicken its pace to about $27.5 billion in buybacks per quarter, a 17% increase over its current rate.\nBut is this the best use of cash for shareholders over the long run? The top two things to consider are whether the company is buying back its stock at an attractive price, and what other opportunities it has with that cash.\nAs for whether Apple is buying its stock at an attractive price, the answer leans toward no. The stock has seen a lot of expansion in the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple over the years, especially after the pandemic. The P/E has more than doubled since around 2019, as has its multiple for enterprise value to EBITDA, which takes into account its debt and cash.\nInvestors have been pushing the stock to higher valuations, while the company's operational performance has not followed. In fact, revenue has not grown through the first six months of its current fiscal year.\nGiven Apple's high valuation multiples compared to before COVID, now might not be the best time to be aggressively buying back its shares.\nAs for whether management has another good option for that cash, artificial intelligence (AI) is looking to be a generational opportunity to invest in. Other large tech companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are investing heavily in this field.\nApple has said that its smartwatches have AI features and that it has the best consumer laptop for AI. But the company hasn't seen much tangible benefit from AI compared to other large tech companies, nor has it indicated an increase in capital expenditures to help capture this opportunity.\nIt also seems content to partner with other companies to use their AI technology when it introduces its next mobile operating system. There are reports that the company has been in talks with OpenAI and Alphabet's Google about using their AI chatbot technology.\nRight now, it looks like Apple is behind in this area. It could be better served by investing in AI or buying a company that achieves the same purpose rather than repurchasing its stock.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to be Bullish on Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "It may seem that Cupertino-based giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fallen behind its Big Tech peers in the race for AI, as the company has only achieved a modest performance of just 3% this year compared to the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d group of leading technology companies. However, several reasons justify my bullish stance on Apple. In this article, I\u2019ll outline three of them: Apple\u2019s advancements in AI, the potential growth in China, and the company\u2019s robust fundamentals and strategic share buybacks.\nSince last year, Apple has made some moves to catch up with its peers, but it\u00a0is\u00a0still\u00a0far from leading\u00a0the pack.\u00a0This\u00a0has sent a bearish wave through the stock, causing the Cupertino company\u2019s share price to\u00a0be stuck\u00a0in second gear.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Apple isn\u2019t making any progress on AI. The Cupertino-based company has been on a shopping spree, acquiring 32 AI start-ups in 2023\u2014more than any other tech giant, which indicates the company\u2019s efforts to expand its AI capabilities. However, as the old saying goes, \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day,\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0it seems the market is ignoring this fact, as other tech companies appear to be more advanced with their AI developments.\nI believe part of the market\u2019s skepticism towards Apple and its early AI efforts has\u00a0been influenced\u00a0by the launch of the VisionPro, the \u201cmagic\u201d virtual reality glasses powered by AI and machine learning. The VisionPro has received mixed reviews, with some users calling it a dud and others praising its immersive experiences. The steep $3,500 price tag hasn\u2019t helped its case,\u00a0either, making it a tough sell for the average consumer.\nAdditionally, Apple has faced challenges in production and demand forecasts, with reports of slashed production numbers and fading hype.\nIn reality, VisionPro was just Apple\u2019s first step into AI. But Apple has also been working on its\u00a0own\u00a0large language models (LLMs) and has even developed a chatbot, although it has yet to define how it will unveil it to the general public. A significant step will\u00a0be taken\u00a0when this model\u00a0is integrated\u00a0into the hardware. This integration\u00a0is expected\u00a0to begin with the launch of the AI App Store in June during its prestigious WWDC developers\u2019 conference.\nEventually, Apple will integrate AI and LLMs into its hardware.\u00a0There is also great anticipation\u00a0regarding Siri\u2019s on-device AI capabilities, such as real-time analysis using the iOS 18 camera.\nIn short, when AI\u00a0is integrated\u00a0into Apple\u2019s massive user base of two billion active iPhones, not counting other iOS devices,\u00a0it\u2019s very likely that\u00a0Apple will\u00a0be taken\u00a0more seriously regarding its AI capabilities.\niPhone demand in China has been a black eye for Apple\u00a0throughout\u00a0this year. The iPhone, Apple\u2019s core segment and accounting for 54% of its revenues, has exposed the company\u2019s over-dependence on a single line of business.\nChina is a crucial market for Apple, but local competition, especially from Huawei, has been gaining ground. A report earlier this year highlighted that Huawei has been eating into Apple\u2019s market share, leading to a 19.1% drop in iPhone sales in China during Q1. Meanwhile, Huawei\u2019s sales surged by 69.7%, driven by a significant upgrade in its new smartphone model after months of struggling to secure parts due to Western sanctions.\nHowever, what currently looks like a black eye could soon turn into a silver lining. Wedbush\u2019s perma-bull analyst Dan Ives suggests that while current economic data in China doesn\u2019t indicate a turnaround, a rise in upgrades could shift the narrative.\u00a0There are 225 million iPhones in China, and 70%\u00a0of these\u00a0haven\u2019t\u00a0been\u00a0upgraded\u00a0in the last three years.\u00a0Ives\u2019 theory is that many of these consumers are moving to Pro models, which boosts the average selling price (ASP) of iPhones in China.\nIn addition to the two reasons mentioned above, I believe Apple\u2019s extraordinarily robust fundamentals round out the case for why Apple stock may still have significant upside potential and recover from its lackluster performance so far this year.\nFirst off, Apple\u2019s fundamentals remain rock solid. Even though market fears have dampened hardware demand amid unimpressive economic growth, Apple is far from a struggling company. Services have been a\u00a0major\u00a0bright spot.\nTake its most recent quarter, for example. Despite iPhone sales dropping 12% year-over-year and product revenues falling 10% year-over-year, services revenue jumped 14.2% year-over-year, hitting an all-time high. This growth in services helped minimize the overall 4.3% drop in net sales, allowing Apple to beat market estimates in both EPS and revenues.\nIn my view, since Apple operates across two main segments\u2014products and services\u2014the latter is where the company\u2019s valuation could see the most growth, especially with the potential AI adoption cycle. The high scalability of the App Store and Apple TV+ further supports this potential.\nMoreover, Apple\u00a0has generated\u00a0a\u00a0massive\u00a0amount of\u00a0cash\u2014$336.6 billion over the last three years.\u00a0Plus, the board recently authorized an additional $110 billion for share buybacks, an amount large enough to purchase almost all the shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), just to give you an idea.\nWith this move, Apple has shown a clear interest in pleasing investors\u00a0who are\u00a0anxious about its share price\u2019s underperformance this year compared to other big tech companies. As a result, AAPL stock has soared more than 11% since announcing its results, demonstrating its historic ability to bounce back from valuation declines.\nThe Wall Street consensus on AAPL stock is largely bullish. Out of the 34 Wall Street analysts who have provided recommendations and target prices on the company in the last three months, 22 have issued a Buy rating, 11 have issued a Hold rating, and only one has issued a Sell rating. The average AAPL stock price target is $207.72, indicating upside potential of 8.1%.\nDespite fears that Apple has missed the AI bandwagon and a few other headwinds, Apple shares have underperformed compared to their big tech peers. But from my perspective, it\u2019s only a matter of time.\nJune will be a key month for Apple, particularly with advances in AI, which\u00a0should\u00a0bring\u00a0a new cycle of\u00a0updates for iPhones and potentially mark\u00a0a turning point for the company.\nGiven Apple\u2019s\u00a0extremely solid\u00a0fundamentals\u2014evidenced by a monumental buyback announcement and significant growth in services that could be the\u00a0major\u00a0catalyst for Apple around AI\u2014I remain bullish on the stock.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Apple\u2019s China sales tell a different story than what analysts have heard for months. Where is the disconnect?",
        "Author": "  Rachyl Jones ",
        "Text": "Are the iPhone\u2019s best days in China behind it?\nThat was the big question going into Apple\u2019s quarterly earnings call on Thursday. By the time the call concluded, Apple\u2019s stock price was up more than 6%, and CEO Tim Cook had repeatedly enthused about his \u201cgreat view\u201d on Apple\u2019s business in China.\nBut despite Wall Street\u2019s positive reaction to Apple\u2019s results (helped by a massive stock buyback announcement), questions about the iPhone\u2019s standing in China may only have become more complicated in the wake of the latest earnings. The company\u2019s surprisingly better-than-expected results in China, and the disparity from what several prominent independent research firms had predicted, reveals a disconnect involving one of the most important pillars of the $2.8 trillion company\u2019s business.\nGreater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, is Apple\u2019s third largest region by revenue, representing 19% of Apple\u2019s total sales during the 2023 fiscal year.\nAs tensions between the U.S. and China have increased over the past year, demand for American tech products, including iPhones, has fallen among Chinese consumers. Meanwhile, Chinese tech companies like Huawei are making headway on new smartphones and guzzling the market share Apple is losing. The Chinese government has supported this shift toward domestic technology, last year ordering state officials to stop using non-Chinese phones for work.\nApple\u2019s revenue in the region has declined on a year-over-year basis in five out of the six most recent quarters, and all signs pointed to more pain in the first three months of 2024.\nIn the beginning of the year, Apple\u2019s weekly shipments into China declined by 30% to 40% year over year on a weekly basis, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, a renowned TF International Securities analyst known for his accurate insights into Apple\u2019s business.\n\u201cThis downward trend is expected to continue,\u201d he wrote in a January blog post. \u201cApple may have the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024,\u201d he said.\nFor the quarter, market research firm Counterpoint estimated Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China were down 19% from the same time last year.\nIt turns out that Apple sales in Greater China did indeed decline in the first three months of the year, coming in 8% below levels a year ago. But that decline was far less severe than Wall Street had been bracing for: Compared with the 13% decline in the fourth quarter of 2023, it was actually an improvement. Sales of iPhone, Apple said, actually increased in mainland China during the quarter (though it didn\u2019t specify if the increase was from the previous quarter, or the previous year).\nThe surprise was enough to prompt multiple questions from analysts during their call with Apple executives. As one analyst on the call bluntly put it: \u201cWhat are we missing?\u201d\nTo that, CEO Tim Cook wouldn\u2019t give an answer, saying he couldn\u2019t address numbers that Apple didn\u2019t produce. \u201cI can only address what our results are,\u201d Cook said. \u201cI can\u2019t bridge to numbers we didn\u2019t come up with.\u201d\nCook said that the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro Max were the two bestselling phones in \u201curban China\u201d during the quarter, and he recounted the \u201cwarm and energetic\u201d reception he received from consumers in Shanghai when he visited and opened a new store in March.\nIt isn\u2019t immediately clear why Apple\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t more closely aligned with the independent research.\nBetween quarterly earnings reports, Wall Street analysts rely on independently collected data to gauge how a company\u2019s business is faring. These research reports can include anything from supply-chain information to retail store inventory levels, gleaned from both official sources and leaks from insider contacts. While this data can\u2019t tell the full story, it does give analysts a strong impression of what\u2019s going on.\nBut the disparity between the third-party research reports and Apple\u2019s report in Q1 left many investors and observers scratching their heads.\nApple reports revenue for China, while many industry analysts look at unit shipments, creating some room for divergence if prices change. Cook\u2019s comments about the newer iPhone 15 models, including the 15 Pro Max, being top sellers in urban China suggests that the company may have benefited from higher prices even if overall units were down more sharply.\nWill Wong, an analyst at IDC, which had projected a 10% unit decline in China iPhone sales, told Bloomberg that different methods of measuring pricing may have prompted some of the confusion.\n\u201cIDC counted the street prices (i.e., the prices that consumers paid), while Apple is likely using another price level, such as factory price, in its financial report,\u201d Wong was quoted as saying.\nFollowing the earnings call with Apple executives, many of Wall Street\u2019s equity research analysts appear to have sided with Apple\u2019s version of the story. Analysts have largely revised their models to reflect a more favorable China business, according to their research notes published on Friday. Bank of America analysts called the China concerns \u201cunfounded,\u201d while analysts from investment firm Wedbush said they expect to see China sales turn a corner by June and show growth by September.\n\u200b\u200b\u201cThe worst is now behind Apple in China,\u201d Wedbush analysts wrote.\nApple\u2019s overall revenue declined 4.3% to $90.8 billion during the quarter, which is better than analysts expected. Apple also beat earnings per share predictions, meeting last year\u2019s number at $1.53. Executives announced its largest stock buyback of $110 billion, an increase from the $80 billion to $90 billion repurchase Apple has offered in recent years.\nBut some analysts remain cautious. While the independent research reports may not have aligned with Apple\u2019s results in China, UBS analysts noted that the iPhone clearly appears to have lost market share in China.\n\u201cPeak China units of 50M in FY 22 is also not likely to be repeated given 300-500 [basis points] of share loss in that region,\u201d UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in a note to investors on Friday, stressing that Apple is not \u201cin the clear yet.\u201d\nUBS, which has a neutral rating on Apple, doesn\u2019t expect the company to sell many more iPhone 16 devices, which are expected to premiere in September, than iPhone 15s. This sentiment is partly because of lost market share in China, the firm said.\nAnd even as Cook talked up China during Thursday\u2019s call, the company also appeared to be laying the groundwork for a future where China was less vital to its business. CFO Luca Maestri noted that other \u201cemerging markets\u201d like India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Turkey, and Indonesia were getting larger and in aggregate nearing the size of China.\n\u201cThe gap as you compare it to China is reducing, and hopefully that trajectory continues for a long time,\u201d Maestri said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Apple's New M4 iPads: 'More Powerful Than Any AI PC' Today, Set To Boost Sales",
        "Author": "  Piero Cingari ",
        "Text": "On May 7, 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced the launch of its latest iPad models: the iPad Pro equipped with the powerful M4 chip and OLED displays, and the iPad Air now featuring the M2 chip. \nThese introductions mark the first update to the iPad lineup since October 2022, signaling a significant step in Apple\u2019s product evolution, and are expected to improve the revenue mix and drive growth going forward, according to Goldman Sachs.\nGoldman Sachs equity analyst Michael Ng highlighted several critical aspects of the new iPad releases that investors should note:\nSupport for Revenue Growth: \u201cThe introduction of the new iPad models aligns with Apple\u2019s forecast for F3Q24E, which anticipates double-digit year-over-year growth in iPad revenue,\u201d Ng stated. This growth is supported by clean iPad channel inventory, thanks to strategic efforts to clear out older models before the new releases. This move is particularly expected to bolster revenue trends in Greater China.\nAdvancements in AI and Processing Power: The new iPad Pro features Apple's latest M4 chip, which is described as \u201cmore powerful than any AI PC NPU today.\u201d The M4 chip's Neural Engine can process up to 38 trillion operations per second, outpacing any current AI PC neural processing unit. This enhancement underscores Apple\u2019s ability to handle on-device AI workloads across its product lines, including the iPhone and Mac, without needing additional upgrades.\nPotential for Improved Price and Product Mix: The new lineup introduces a larger variety of sizes and prices, particularly for the iPad Air, which is now available in 11-inch and 13-inch models. This change is significant as \u201chalf of the iPad Pro users purchase the larger screen size,\u201d presenting a clear opportunity to improve the price and product mix. The iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model, showing a price increase compared to the previous models from October 2022. Even with increased starting storage (256GB versus 128GB), there remains a roughly $100 price hike, normalized for this change.\nAdditional Product Updates: Alongside the iPads, Apple announced new models of the Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil. The Magic Keyboard, priced at $299 for the 11-inch and $349 for the 13-inch, includes a larger trackpad, a USB-C port, and a functional top row. The Apple Pencil Pro, at $129, is compatible with both the new iPad Air and iPad Pro, introducing features like squeeze, barrel roll, and haptic feedback. These are the first updates to the Smart Keyboard since 2019 and the Apple Pencil since 2019.\nRead also: Apple\u2019s iPads Playing Crucial Role In Russia-Ukraine War: Kyiv Is Using Them To Control Western Weapons, Says US Defense Undersecretary\nGoldman Sachs has reiterated a Buy rating on Apple with a 12-month target price of $226, implying a potential 25% increase from current levels.\nAccording to Ng, while the market is concerned about slower product revenue growth, \u201cthe strength of Apple\u2019s ecosystem and the visibility of its revenue streams should offset these worries.\u201d\nFactors like Apple\u2019s growing installed base, the secular growth in services, and continuous product innovation are expected to balance out the cyclical challenges in product revenue, including the longer iPhone replacement cycle and softer demand in the PC and tablet markets.\nBelow is a comprehensive look at the new models, their specifications, and pricing:\n\nModel\nDisplay Size (in)\nOther specs\nRelease Date\nStorage (GB)\nLaunch Price (USD)\niPad Pro (7th-gen, WiFi only)\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n256\n$1,299\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n512\n$1,499\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n1000\n$1,899\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n2000\n$2,299\n12.9\nNano-texture glass\n5/15/2024\n1000\n$1,999\n12.9\nNano-texture glass\n5/15/2024\n2000\n$2,399\niPad Pro (7th-gen, WiFi + Cellular)\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n256\n$1,499\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n512\n$1,699\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n1000\n$2,099\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n2000\n$2,499\n12.9\nNano-texture glass\n5/15/2024\n1000\n$2,199\n12.9\nNano-texture glass\n5/15/2024\n2000\n$2,599\niPad Air (WiFi only)\n10.9\n5/15/2024\n$599\n10.9\n5/15/2024\n$699\n10.9\n5/15/2024\n$899\n10.9\n5/15/2024\n$1,099\niPad Air (WiFi + Cellular)\n10.9\n5/15/2024\n$749\n10.9\n5/15/2024\n$849\n10.9\n5/15/2024\n$1,049\n10.9\n5/15/2024\n$1,249\niPad Air (larger model, WiFi only)\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n$799\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n$899\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n$1,099\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n$1,299\niPad Air (larger model, WiFi + Cellular)\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n$949\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n$1,049\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n$1,249\n12.9\n5/15/2024\n$1,449\nRead now: Tim Cook Kicked Off iPad Event By Hyping Up Apple Vision Pro, Top Analyst Says It\u2019s \u2018Just A Reminder\u2019 While Jim Cramer Says \u2018It\u2019s Not A Bust\u2019\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nBarclays\nMaintains\nEqual-Weight\nFeb 2022\nTigress Financial\nMaintains\nStrong Buy\nJan 2022\nCredit Suisse\nMaintains\nNeutral\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Apple's New M4 iPads: 'More Powerful Than Any AI PC' Today, Set To Boost Sales originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Analysts hope generative AI could kick off another iPhone sales supercycle. But, so far, the technology doesn't appear to be driving sales of competing smartphones from the likes of Samsung and Google.\nCook has been relatively tightlipped regarding Apple's generative AI plans, dropping small tidbits about the company's investments here and there. This is one of the first times he's come out so strongly about how Apple will set itself apart from its Big Tech rivals in the generative AI space.\nWall Street is waiting on tenterhooks for Apple's generative AI announcements. The company hasn't debuted any generative AI products since the technology exploded in popularity in late 2022.\nRivals including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, have rolled out a series of generative AI capabilities and products including chatbots and search engine improvements. Microsoft, in particular, has added generative AI directly to Windows 11 via the Windows 11 Copilot.\nIf Apple's generative AI plans are going to live up to Wall Street's expectations, it will need to enable some kind of must-have features that users can't get on their existing devices.

        "Title": "Apple unveils record $110 billion buyback as results beat low expectations",
        "Author": "  Stephen Nellis, Max A. Cherney and Yuvraj Malik ",
        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis, Max A. Cherney and Yuvraj Malik\n(Reuters) - Apple's quarterly results and forecast beat modest expectations on Thursday, as the iPhone maker unveiled a record share buyback program, sending its stock up 6% in extended trade.\nApple increased its cash dividend by 4% and authorized an additional program to buy back $110 billion of stock. The buyback is the largest in the company's history.\nApple's quarterly revenue fell, but less than analysts had expected, and CEO Tim Cook said revenue growth would return in the current quarter.\nThe results and guidance suggest the company may be regaining its footing in the smartphone market, despite stiff competition and regulatory challenges.\nThe surge in Apple's shares following its report lifted its stock market value by over $160 billion.\nApple said fiscal second-quarter revenue fell 4% to $90.8 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $90.01 billion, according to LSEG data.\nFor Apple's current quarter, which ends in June, Cook told Reuters the iPhone maker expects \"to grow low-single digits\" in overall revenue. Wall Street expected 1.33% revenue growth to $82.89 billion, according to LSEG data.\nLong considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling 10% this year as it struggles with weak iPhone demand and tough competition in China.\nApple expects current-quarter services and iPad revenue to grow by double digits, CFO Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call. The company expects gross margins of between 45.5% and 46.5% for the fiscal third quarter.\nApple faces a raft of challenges across its business. Smartphone rivals such as Samsung Electronics have introduced competing devices aimed at hosting artificial-intelligence chatbots.\nOn the regulatory front, Apple's services business, which contains its lucrative App Store and was one of the few areas of growth in the fiscal second quarter, is under pressure from a new law in Europe. In the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market and driving up prices.\nFor the fiscal second quarter, iPhone sales fell 10.5% to $45.96 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $46 billion. Apple executives said in February that the year-ago fiscal second quarter had benefited from a $5 billion surge in iPhone sales as the company caught up from supply-chain snarls during pandemic lockdowns.\nExcluding that one-time phenomenon, iPhone sales were down only slightly as the Cupertino, California, company's signature product faces stiff competition. In China, Huawei Technology has gained market share.\nCook said that iPhone sales still experienced \"growth in some markets, including China.\"\nApple's revenue decline in China was not as steep as analysts expected, with Greater China sales of $16.37 billion for the fiscal second quarter that ended March 30, down 8.1% and above analyst expectations of $15.59 billion, according to data from Visible Alpha.\nApple has said little about its product plans for artificial intelligence, the technology on which rivals Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are placing huge bets. The company started ramping up research and development spending last year, and Cook said the company has spent more than $100 billion on R&D in the past five years.\n\"We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI and we're making significant investments,\" he said. \"We're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers\" at events later this year, Cook said.\nAs it races to bring AI into its products, Apple's massive buyback program may appease investors who have been bruised by its sinking stock price.\n\"It's certainly a great time to resort to this strategy as, on the one hand, the stock remains relatively fairly priced, and, on the other hand, it needs to garner solid support for a structural shift that may very well take several quarters to play out,\" Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said in a client note.\nApple's quarterly earnings per share were $1.53, above Wall Street estimates of $1.50, according to LSEG data.\nSales in Apple's services segment, which also represents Apple Music and TV offerings, rose to $23.87 billion, above analyst expectations of $23.27 billion, according to LSEG data.\nAnalysts had expected Mac sales to decline in the fiscal second quarter, but they instead grew to $7.5 billion, compared with estimates of $6.86 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\"They were really driven by the strength of the new MacBook Air that's powered by the M3 chip,\" Cook said. \"About half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter were new to the Mac.\"\nThe company's sales in the iPad segment declined to $5.56 billion, below analyst expectations of $5.91 billion.\nIn the company's wearables segment, which represents sales of Apple Watches and AirPods headphones, sales fell to $7.91 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $8.08 billion, according to LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max A.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Apple will deliver some of its upcoming artificial intelligence features this year through data centers powered by its own in-house chips, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, as the iPhone maker looks to integrate generative AI in its products.\nThe company is putting its chips in cloud-computing servers capable of processing advanced AI tasks coming to Apple devices, the report stated, citing people familiar with the matter.\nApple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nThe chips are similar to those that power Apple's Mac computers, the report said, adding that simpler AI-related tasks will be processed on-device.\nThe plan to use its own chips and cloud processing for AI tasks was conceived around three years ago, but Apple sped up the timeline after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT kicked off an AI craze, according to the report.\nEarlier this week, Apple announced its next-generation chipset, the M4, which will be powering the new iPad Pro models and will support some AI capabilities.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n"

        "Author": "  Insider Monkey Transcripts ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 2, 2024\nApple Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.53, expectations were $1.5.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Good Afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations.\nThese statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin-America and the Middle East, as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential. In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year-ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.\nWe estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described. Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room. It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market.\nFor example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before, and this is just the beginning. Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in-store. We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in Generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create.\nAs we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do. Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including Mainland China, and according to Kantar during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in Urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone.\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future. Turning to Mac. March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and it\u2019s even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it.\nIn iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year, due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th Generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year-ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day.\nAcross our watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine-learning to power lifesaving features like a regular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need. As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ Originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt.\nApple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins. Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail, our stores continued to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time.\nEverywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and lead the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing. Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period.\nAnd we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before. Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades. Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects. And last month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors, who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund.\nWhether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets.\nCompany gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion, diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier.\nAdjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air, powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.\nAnd our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Also customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S. iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare.\nLast year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high and customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S. In services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed-base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continued to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem.\nBoth transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over $1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We continued to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay. Turning to enterprise, our customers continued to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the Mac. In Healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for healthcare organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use.\nAnd since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise. Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance during the first-half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin-America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey.\nThese results, coupled with double-digit growth in services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open-market repurchases of $130 million Apple's shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over time.\nWe are also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continued to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points.\nWe expect our services business to grow double-digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first-half of the fiscal year. And we expect iPad revenue to grow double-digits. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% to -- and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nSee also\n25 Best Self-Help Books for Women According to Reddit and\nTop 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n"

        "Title": "Judge grills Apple exec about whether company is defying order to enable more iPhone payment options",
        "Author": "  MICHAEL LIEDTKE ",
        "Text": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday questioned whether Apple has set up a gauntlet of exasperating hurdles to discourage the use of alternative payment options in iPhone apps, despite a court order seeking to create more ways for consumers to pay for digital services.\nThe verbal sparring between Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers and the head of Apple's app store kicked off a hearing focused on whether Apple is still steering U.S. consumers to its once-exclusive app payment system in defiance of an injunction aimed at promoting more choices that could help lower prices.\nGonzalez Rogers' order requires Apple to allow app developers to display links to other options besides the company's own payment system in the U.S. Apple makes billions of dollars annually from that setup, which imposes commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within the most popular iPhone apps.\nApple's app store and its commission system also is being targeted in another antitrust case recently filed by the U.S. Justice Department in a case alleging the iPhone walls off competition in a variety of ways that stifle competition and innovation.\nGonzalez Rogers often sounded frustrated and skeptical as she periodically chimed in during four hours of testimony from Matthew Fischer, the Apple executive in charge of the iPhone app store.\nThe tone of the judge's questions indicated she is concerned Apple's efforts to comply with her order have been primarily designed to protect the company's profits instead of making it easier for iPhone users to switch to other in-app payment options, as she intended.\nGonzalez Rogers was particularly pointed as she grilled Fischer about whether Apple had deliberately made it more cumbersome and confusing for consumers to make digital purchases through alternative services.\n\u201cOther than to stifle competition, I can see no other answer,\u201d the judge said as she tried to dissect the rationale for Apple's design of alternative payment option system for iPhone apps.\nFischer maintained Apple is complying with the judge's order while still trying to shield iPhone users from bad actors on the internet and enabling the Cupertino, California, company to reap a return on its investments in the app store and other mobile software.\nToward that end, Apple has introduced a new commission structure ranging from 12% to 27% on digital transactions initiated from within an app and completed on an alternative payment option. After Gonzalez Rogers said it sounded like Apple was still collecting a \u201cwindfall,\u201d Fischer said the company expected its effective commission rate on digital transactions processed by alternative payment options to be about 18%.\n\u201cWe are running a business,\u201d Fischer said.\nApple spent more than two years trying to overturn the order that Gonzalez Rogers issued as part of a broader antitrust battle that the company won. The injunction requiring Apple to allow links to alternative app payments took effect in January after U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case.\nBut Fischer disclosed Wednesday that Apple so far has only received and approved applications to display links to alternative payment systems from 38 apps so far \u2014 a fraction of the roughly 2 million iPhone apps available in the U.S. Fischer couldn't specify how many of those apps engage in digital transactions when asked by Gonzalez Rogers, who ordered Apple to provide the number as the proceedings progress this month.\nVideo game Epic Games cites the muted interest in applying for in-app links to alternative payment options as evidence that Apple was still rigging the system in its favor.\nEpic, maker of the popular Fortnite video game, is trying to force Apple to make more sweeping changes to accommodate alternative payment options after it unsuccessfully tried to persuade Gonzalez Rogers that the iPhone app store had turned into a price-gouging monopoly during a 2021 trial.\nThe effort is being supported by Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms, Elon Musk\u2019s X short-messaging service, music streaming service Spotify and long-time Apple rival Microsoft.\nApple\u2019s current alternative payment formula \u201cis guaranteed to continue extracting excessive commissions from developers\u201d while also blocking them from steering consumers to other places where they could buy the same digital services for lower prices, Epic asserted in documents leading up to Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\nIn its own pre-hearing briefs, Apple accused Epic of trying to get Gonzalez Rogers to micromanage its business in ways designed to boost the video game maker\u2019s profits.\n\u201cEpic has repeatedly made clear that what it wants is access to and use of Apple\u2019s tools and technologies without having to pay for them,\" Apple argued.\nThe court hearings are scheduled to resume Friday when another top Apple executive, Phil Schiller, is expected to testify. Gonzalez Rogers hopes to wrap up the hearings by May 17, but told lawyers Wednesday it might take longer than that.\n"

And then we have unique experiences we've built on top of that platform,\u201d Microsoft consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo I think we have a distinct advantage for a period of time here.\u201d\nMicrosoft says it\u2019s achieved this through a new category of AI PCs it\u2019s calling Copilot+ PCs.\nYou\u2019ve probably already heard about AI PCs, which are PCs that include special neural processing units (NPUs) that can run AI apps locally rather than relying on cloud-based services like ChatGPT.\nCopilot+ PCs include those same NPUs, but also come with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and, importantly, run Microsoft\u2019s Copilot AI assistant for Windows 11.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot+ PCs come as the PC industry hopes it\u2019s entering a period of sustained sales growth after two years of steep declines. According to IDC, PC sales grew 1.5% in the first quarter compared to a drop of 28.7% in Q1 last year.\n\u201cThere's no doubt in my mind that the demand is here,\u201d Mehdi said. \u201cAnd this is going to spur a purchase of PCs in ways that we haven't had before.\u201d\nFor the first time in decades, Mehdi added, Microsoft feels it has an edge on Apple from both a performance standpoint and because it offers \u201ccompletely unique things that you can\u2019t do anywhere else.\u201d\nApple is notoriously behind Microsoft in the AI race, having sat on the sidelines until very recently \u2014 though it has made sure that its hardware has extremely fast AI-ready chips.\nLooking to take advantage of Apple being caught on the back foot, Microsoft hopes the Copilot+, which is powered by GPT-4o, will provide a seismic productivity boost with the ability to serve as a user's go-to assistant for tasks ranging from dealing with common problems like audio issues to summarizing documents.\nMicrosoft also introduced its new Copilot Recall, a feature that makes it easier to search virtually everything you\u2019ve done on your PC, including documents, photos, and web pages. So, if you were planning a trip to Seattle but lost the site you were using to look up things to do, you can type \u201cSeattle\u201d into Recall, which will pull up the site you were browsing.\nMicrosoft says it does this by taking a snapshot of your screen over time and then using Copilot\u2019s visual search feature to find the content you\u2019re looking for. The company also says content saved in Recall is only stored on your device and that you can customize which apps use the feature.\nMicrosoft\u2019s first Copilot+ PCs will hit the market in June starting at $999, conspicuously the same price as Apple\u2019s MacBook Air.\nWindows and Mac users may have different priorities, with many of them engrained in a specific ecosystem and unlikely to change. That is, unless perhaps fresh and exclusive AI functionality lures somebody over the fence. But they can still be put head to head.\nPerformance benchmarks have become major talking points, and Apple\u2019s Mac laptops have been crushing Windows-based PCs in terms of power efficiency ever since the iPhone maker rolled out its first M1 chip for MacBooks in 2020.\nThose Arm-based (ARM) chips have made it so MacBooks can last all day on a single charge while providing exceptional overall performance across a multitude of use cases. But Microsoft says its Windows PCs have a new weapon that puts it back in a leadership position: Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Pro chips.\nDuring its announcement on Monday, the company said a Copilot+ PC running on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite chip gets 20% more battery life, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance than Apple\u2019s MacBook Air with an M3 chip.\nWhat\u2019s more, Mehdi said Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs beat out Apple\u2019s latest M4 chip in terms of trillions of operations per second, or TOPs, a common measurement for gauging potential AI app performance.\nFor now, Microsoft has the edge thanks to an actual AI product. But Apple isn\u2019t taking any of this lying down. The company will host its annual WWDC event on June 10, where it\u2019s expected to roll out its own AI apps and services, including some that Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman says will run on OpenAI\u2019s AI software.\nAnd as far as its MacBooks go, Apple is still likely to announce its M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, which should offer better performance than its M4 and could outpace Qualcomm\u2019s chips.\nMark June 10 on your calendar.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Exchange-traded funds holding Apple Inc. moved higher Friday after the iPhone maker reported first quarter results that exceeded expectations and announced a $110 billion share buyback.\nShares of Cupertino, California-based Apple jumped around 7%. Apple reported it earned $1.53 per share, beating the estimate of $1.51, while revenues of $90.8 billion beat the $90.4 billion expectation.\nThe stock was also supported by the company's announcement that it would buy back an additional $110 billion worth of shares. That was more than the $90 billion in buybacks the company had announced in recent years.\nRevenues for Apple have fallen year-over-year in five of the past six quarters, but investors were assuaged by comments from Apple that indicated growth in the low single digits for Q2.\nApple is held by 458 exchange-traded funds, including big weightings in many tech ETFs like the $63 billion Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and the $62 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which allocate over a fifth of their portfolios to the stock. The stock also has a hefty 8.5% weighting in the popular $250 billion Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). All of those funds rose today.\nFor aggressive traders who want more concentrated exposure to Apple, the $60 million Direxion Daily AAPL Bull 2X Shares (AAPU) offers just that. That fund jumped 13% midday Friday, twice the gain for shares of Apple.\nExpectations were low for Apple ahead of the release of its first quarter earnings report. The stock was down by 10% since the start of the year, sharply lagging the S&P 500\u2019s 6.2% return.\nAfter today\u2019s jump, Apple\u2019s losses have been cut to 4%.\nIndustry channel checks had suggested that the iPhone had lost significant market share in China.\nBut even though Apple\u2019s China revenue dropped 8% from a year ago in Q1, the company attributed it to a drop in sales of other products\u2014not the iPhone.\nApple CEO Tim Cook noted that iPhone revenues in China actually increased, which was a relief for investors. \n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Title": "Is Apple Missing Out on the AI Hype?",
        "Author": "  Dilantha De Silva ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence buzz across the tech world has increased over the past year. All the big players are competing with each other to grab a piece of this booming market. Nevertheless, one tech giant is seemingly on the limp in this race for dominance, or at least that's the image it wants to portray. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has always stepped up the game by boosting innovation and enhancing the user experience. But with AI, the tech giant has been maintaining a discrete profile for a long time.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BTI.\nIt is beyond doubt that AI is here to revolutionize the tech landscape, a sort of renaissance if one thinks of it. PwC estimates AI will contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Given these rosy projections, Apple's toned-down approach toward the technology has raised speculations about whether it is missing out on the AI hype or playing its cards in silence to take the market by surprise.\nDespite recent financial struggles, including a major revenue slump since the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Apple saw a nearly 50% spike last year, though it lagged other tech giants such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company had a challenging start to 2024 with shares tumbling amid a series of analyst downgrades and was dethroned by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world. Some critics have blamed Apple for not having a clear AI strategy unlike its competitors, such as Microsoft and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), which are aggressively investing in the technology.\nWhen it comes to AI (or machine learning, as Apple prefers to say), the company is not new to integrating such features into its devices. It has revolutionized many features using machine learning, including Siri, facial recognition and personalized recommendations. However, in the current landscape, compared to other tech giants, Apple has taken a more cautious approach to introducing and announcing AI features and investments. Apple is making calculated moves in the AI space behind the scenes. The company has acquired several AI start-ups in the past decade and is partnering with universities and research institutions to collaborate on projects.\nResearch and development spending is one of the key indicators to measure a company's commitment to introducing new features and advancements into its business strategy, especially for tech companies. Apple's R&D spending was roughly 7% of its revenue for 2022. In comparison, in the same year, Google and Microsoft allocated nearly double for R&D and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) spending was more than four times Apple's. According to the 2023 Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard by the European Commission, Apple ranks in fourth place, above Asian rivals Huawei (fifth) and Samsung (XKRX:005930) (seventh). However, the company ranks below Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft (first three places). While this spending disparity could be highlighting a difference in priorities, it is easy to overlook Apple's strategy of acquiring resources in other areas to step up innovation.\nRecent reports suggest Apple could enter an AI partnership with Alphabet's Google. As per Bloomberg, Apple is negotiating with the Google parent company to license its state-of-the-art AI model, Gemini. If the deal goes through, Apple might integrate Gemini's AI features into its upcoming operating systems for devices. The possibility of this partnership raises many questions about the company's long-standing tradition of prioritizing in-house development and tight control over its technology.\nGoogle and Apple have been in a strategic partnership for a long while and it has proven to be a profitable one. Currently, Google is the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser, and to secure this position Google is reportedly paying around $18 billion annually to Apple. Therefore, Google's AI model Gemini seems like a natural choice for Apple. However, other than the obvious contradiction of the iPhone maker's privacy-first policy, this deal might raise many other concerns, including legal challenges and reduced quality in the user experience.\nCurrently, tech giants are facing scrutiny around the world, especially from the U.S. government and European Union. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for its alleged monopoly on the smartphone market and unfair treatment of developers through its App Store system. Partnering with another major tech firm and a rival might fuel the current controversy and could attract more legal scrutiny. Moreover, if Apple begins to rely on Google for AI tools, it could stifle competition and reduce consumer choices in the future for potential AI feature upgrades. Google's AI is a cloud-based system that allows developers to use consumer data to strengthen the LLM to become more efficient, which means the privacy of the user data will not be assured. This means more red flags for Apple.\nThe current regulatory scrutiny is already hampering Apple's operations. The potential delay in winning the lawsuit and the restrictions that may be imposed by the government could hinder the company's efforts in the AI field. Additionally, the financial burden of a lawsuit could put a halt on the company's ability to find an internal AI solution. Moreover, a well-defined and transparent data protection framework should be put into practice before entering into a partnership with Google, if at all.\nEven though Apple is not vocal about its advancements with AI efforts, several ongoing projects are making progress. News surrounding the company's own AI model has garnered substantial traction. According to sources, Apple has reportedly developed a large language model called Ajax GPT, with a performing capacity exceeding GPT 3.5. Also, it may be working on an AI-powered chatbot dubbed Apple GPT.\nApple might have been suspiciously quiet about AI in product launches. However, it has acquired the greatest number of startups among all tech giants since 2017. The company is likely to have spent around $1 billion in acquiring various AI ventures. In 2023 alone, Apple reportedly bought more than 30 AI ventures. These acquisitions take place mostly to cover various specialties such as self-driving technology, voice design, music generation and image recognition, but sometimes to even acquire the talented individuals behind these startups.\nThe latest and most important addition to Apple's AI arsenal is DarwinAI. Acquiring DarwinAI can be seen as an investment in technology as well as personnel, particularly specialists in machine learning and AI from the University of Waterloo. A prominent figure in the AI community and former director at the University of Waterloo, Alexander Wang, is currently appointed as a director at Apple, leading the company's AI efforts in Canada. Also, DarwinAI's synthesis model is expected to help Apple's most ambitious AI capability; on-device AI (also referred to as Edge AI) with plans to move forward with generative AI programs in the future.\nTwo recent theses published by Apple have shown the company's effectiveness in incorporating advanced levels of AI within the pre-existing ecosystem. One research paper in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne delves into the development of the MM1 generative AI model. The results of the thesis demonstrate Apple's capabilities in developing cutting-edge AI architectures, particularly multimodal learning, which combines images with text data.\nAnother paper published showcases the successful execution of large language models in natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks with limited memory. The methods used in the thesis collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a four to 25 times increase in inference speed compared to other approaches in CPU and GPU. Ultimately, this research paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory to deliver exceptionally faster performance.\nBoth these research papers and recent acquisitions indicate Apple is on the right track to offering on-device AI capabilities that will far exceed what is currently available in the market.\nVoice Assistant, Facial Recognition, Photo optimization, Personalized recommendations, Animoji and Fitness tracking may look like functions that have nothing to do with AI, but all these features are fundamentally built upon various machine learning technologies. Apple was the pioneering tech brand that managed to integrate these features seamlessly into mobile devices successfully. Today, it is working behind the scenes to improve these features by integrating AI.\nWhen Siri, the voice assistant, was released, it was received remarkably well across the globe. But soon after the initial product launch, because of Siri's inability to complete slightly advanced tasks, its credibility declined. Following many internal conflicts faced by Apple's Siri team with engineers frustrated by a lack of tools and data to improve it, the chat bot has started lagging behind its competitors. Meanwhile, Google Assistant, with its superior natural language processing and ability to handle complex queries, and Amazon Alexa, with its vast compatible ecosystem, are gaining momentum.\nWith the new on-device AI integration, Apple may have reversed the future of Siri and also could enhance the performance of Apple fitness trackers. The Apple Watch already integrates AI features to enhance fitness tracking. For example, the watch uses machine learning to identify workout types and analyze heart rate data, helping to offer more personalized coaching assistance. However, some competitors offer more advanced AI-powered health monitoring features, including blood pressure monitoring.\nKeeping up with its brand of prioritizing the user experience more than anything else, Apple has made its first direct AI-related product with the new MacBook Air with an M3 chip highlighting its capabilities for AI tasks. This can be seen as a major breakthrough in Apple's AI strategy, promising its customers not a cloud-based AI service, but an on-device AI experience that upholds user privacy.\nApple follows a pattern of announcing new features as they are coming to the market. Therefore, the upcoming Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June may bring potential AI-related announcements. Speculations suggest AI features will be integrated into the new Mac OS as well as iOS 18. The speculations are further strengthened with Apple acknowledging the term AI in its latest quarterly earnings transcript, deviating from its usual terminology. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook has confirmed the introduction of generative AI software in Apple products later in the year.\nAdditionally, the introduction of AI-integrated hardware such as Edge AI is expected to have a positive impact on the iPhone upgrade cycle. With the current upcycle period standing at a record high of 4.5 years, users upgrading their mobiles for a better AI-powered user experience will boost new hardware sales. This is crucial for Apple amid four straight quarters of sales declines and the dampening sales numbers in China. Analysts such as Dan Ives and Ben Reitzes believe that with AI integration, Apple will experience another supercycle in smartphone upgrades.\nApple may not be as aggressively discussing its AI plans compared to other tech giants, but the company is making steady progress behind the scenes. The company's on-device AI integration strategy may prove to be the differentiator in the future. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26, the stock is valued at a premium to the five-year average of 24. This premium may seem unjustifiable at first, but if the company's on-device AI strategy succeeds, a potential iPhone upgrade supercycle will help it book stellar revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. Apple is certainly not missing out on AI despite not joining the hype publicly, yet. Contrarian investors may want to build a position in Apple to potentially benefit from a surprise AI announcement in the coming months.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Microsoft Is Outpacing Apple in Innovation and Growth",
        "Author": "  Oliver Rodzianko ",
        "Text": "I last covered Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) in December, and I allocated a buy rating to the stock. At this time, I believe it offers significantly stronger future price return potential and exposure to diversified innovation than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). I have, therefore, performed deeper research into the structural differences between the two companies. Therefore, this thesis provides a comparative analysis of the two companies to determine which has the highest competitive benefit moving forward.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nThere are distinct differences structurally between Microsoft and Apple, which contribute to why I think Apple may benefit from a slight readjustment at this time toward how Microsoft operates. Consider the following table:\nMicrosoft\nApple\nStructure\nProduct-based\nFunction-based\nDecisions\nSemi-autonomous\nHighly centralized\nProducts\nBroad portfolio\nIntegrated ecosystem\nCulture\nMatrix structure\nInnovation-driven\nSegments\nProduct lines\nFunctional areas\nI am not suggesting Apple become exactly like Microsoft, and in fact, much of what made Apple magical is its highly innovative ecosystem approach. In essence, it has been a culture of innovation since Steve Jobs founded it. However, without his genius, I think a more typical matrix structure would be well-received by shareholders at this time. That should not discount the importance of hiring the best talent for innovation, and I believe Apple has proven it still values this properly through its recent release of the Apple Vision Pro. However, let's not forget this product is nowhere near as revolutionary and popular as the iPhone was.\nWhat Microsoft has going for it is its semi-autonomous divisions, which act as separate entities with their own budgets and resources, allow for a more targeted and efficient allocation of capital. In turn, this can optimize the returns on investment. There is also a greater emphasis on diversification with Microsoft, reducing dependency on single products, markets or brands and spreading out financial risk.\nWhat I think Apple needs now is to balance the innovation it is known for with the financial prudence that has been developed over the long term by Bill Gates (Trades, Portfolio)' Microsoft, which I believe is more inspired by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) than by the radical creative approach of some other business leaders like Elon Musk and Jobs.\nThere are several areas that suggest Apple may be lagging behind Microsoft.\nFirst, in fiscal 2023, iPhone sales accounted for approximately 52% of Apple's total revenue. This heavy reliance on a single product made the company vulnerable to market saturation. In contrast, Microsoft's diverse revenue streams, including Office, LinkedIn, Azure, Windows, Surface and Xbox, mitigate this risk.\nMicrosoft Azure has been a key driver of growth for the company. The product's revenue grew by 27% in fiscal 2023. In contrast, Apple does not dominate the cloud market. It is, therefore, not exposed to the same growth potential.\nFurther, Apple also has lower research and development spending at this time. In fiscal 2023 it reported its R&D at about 7.80% of its total revenue. The same year, Microsoft reported R&D investments of around 12.80% of its total revenue. As its R&D investments are spread around multiple high-growth areas, this positions Microsoft for potentially higher levels of innovation and long-term growth.\nAlthough Apple is still one of the most valuable companies in the world, its market capitalization growth has been slower compared to Microsoft in recent years. Microsoft has less vulnerability due to its diversified approach and, at this time, its long-term prosperity looks to be stronger.\nThe company has been conservative with acquisitions, limiting its expansion into new markets. Microsoft, on the other hand, has made several high-profile acquisitions, including LinkedIn, GitHub and Activision Blizzard.\nApple and Microsoft are both strong companies, but the latter is proving itself to be more fiscally prudent, with a nature of strategic acquisitions and diversification, which arguably sustains its moat for longer and builds it wider than Apple's more localized approach.\nTo begin my comparative value analysis, please consider the following graph, which compares Microsoft and Apple's trailing 12-month price-earnings ratios.\nAs we can see, Apple is just slightly lower valued than Microsoft at this time. This is arguably justified based on the operations analysis I presented above. The good news is I do not think either company looks overvalued compared to the wider industry:\nCurrent P/E Ratio Without NRI\nMicrosoft\n37\nApple\n30\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n50\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n27\nMeta (NASDAQ:META)\n27\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n69\nIn many respects, Apple and Microsoft offer a fair valuation, but Microsoft has much better growth potential. Therefore, I believe Microsoft is the better investment at this time.\nBoth Microsoft and Apple trade above what I estimate as intrinsic value, which can be elucidated in the following table:\nMicrosoft\nApple\nCurrent EPS Without NRI\n$11.56\n$6.43\nForecasted EPS Without NRI CAGR 2024-2034\n15%\n10%\nForecasted EPS Without NRI CAGR 2034-2044\n7%\n5%\nDiscount Rate\n10%\n10%\nIntrinsic Value Estimate\n$304\n$114.50\nStock Price\n$428\n$190.70\nOvervaluation\n40.70%\n66.50%\nThe table does not indicate that both companies are actually overvalued, as the analysis needs to consider the sentiment analysis I performed above. I believe each stock is likely fairly valued. However, Microsoft offers better growth prospects, which significantly improves its outlook in a discounted earnings model.\nWhile this thesis clearly shows I believe Microsoft has a stronger future ahead of it than Apple at this time, there are significant risks that Microsoft is also going to have to navigate. One of the primary downsides that comes with the software company's diversified portfolio approach is that it may struggle with uniformity and integration risks, reducing the effectiveness of its overall ecosystem and potentially having a negative effect on the customer experience. This is what Jobs was clever in developing at Apple. Nonetheless, Microsoft could find its range of high-growth investments has a shorter half-life than a more integrated approach led by pioneering innovators. The issue here is I do not believe Apple has a Jobs equivalent at the helm at this time to continue to cultivate this direction of radical innovation to drive growth.\nIn addition, many innovators are not in the technology field for the money. In my opinion, the best talents are usually missionaries rather than capital allocators looking to profit from the stock. In essence, Microsoft could attract individuals who are more finance-oriented rather than creative, reducing the long-term magic fostered within the company over time and instead creating a less lucrative environment for technological advancement if it is not careful with how it sets up incentives and values within its culture.\nApple is struggling with Jobs no longer at the helm of the company. In this new era, I believe Apple needs to strategically redirect itself and take some inspiration from the way Microsoft structures itself. Apple could use a more expansive acquisition and investment strategy with an approach similar to a holding company being introduced.\nApple's markets are saturated, and its iPhone accounted for 52% of its total revenue in fiscal 2023. The company had almost half the R&D spend relative to revenue compared to Microsoft that year. Microsoft has a broader portfolio, where its diversification protects shareholder value and exposes investors to higher growth opportunities.\nMicrosoft performs better than Apple in my discounted earnings analysis, but I believe both companies to be fairly valued at this time. However, for investors seeking higher growth, Microsoft seems to be the stronger long-term investment.\nWhile Microsoft has a clever capital allocation strategy, it must be careful that it does not lose out on the best creative talent and that its customer experience does not suffer as a result of too much diversification and a loss of focus on the importance of ecosystem development.\nMicrosoft's prudent financial structure, which I believe was inspired by Buffett and adapted for the field of technology, places it in an incredibly strong position moving forward. Its diversified portfolio of investments exposes investors to higher levels of innovation and growth than Apple, in turn giving it a better valuation based on my discounted earnings analyses.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Don't Overlook Apple (AAPL) International Revenue Trends While Assessing the Stock",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Did you analyze how Apple (AAPL) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending March 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\nOur review of AAPL's last quarterly performance uncovered some notable trends in the revenue contributions from its international markets, which are commonly analyzed and tracked by Wall Street experts.\nFor the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $90.75 billion, experiencing a decline of 4.3% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of AAPL's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations.\nA Dive into AAPL's International Revenue Trends\nRest of Asia Pacific generated $6.72 billion in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 7.4% of the total. This represented a surprise of -4.49% compared to the $7.04 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Rest of Asia Pacific accounted for $10.16 billion (8.5%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $8.12 billion (8.6%) to the total revenue.\nJapan accounted for 6.9% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $6.26 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -2.51%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $6.42 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Japan contributed $7.77 billion (6.5%) and $7.18 billion (7.6%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nOf the total revenue, $24.12 billion came from Europe during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 26.6%. This represented a surprise of +7.92% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $22.35 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $30.4 billion, or 25.4%, and $23.95 billion, or 25.3%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Greater China contributed $16.37 billion in revenue, making up 18.0% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $16.59 billion, this meant a surprise of -1.33%. Looking back, Greater China contributed $20.82 billion, or 17.4%, in the previous quarter, and $17.81 billion, or 18.8%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nInternational Revenue Predictions\nWall Street analysts expect Apple to report $82.45 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 0.8% from the year-ago quarter. Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan, Europe and Greater China are expected to contribute 7.3% ($6.01 billion), 6.2% ($5.11 billion), 24.3% ($20.07 billion) and 18% ($14.86 billion) to the total revenue, respectively.\nFor the full year, the company is expected to generate $382.77 billion in total revenue, down 0.1% from the previous year. Revenues from Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan, Europe and Greater China are expected to constitute 7.8% ($29.79 billion), 6.5% ($24.9 billion), 24.9% ($95.2 billion) and 17.7% ($67.63 billion) of the total, respectively.\nThe Bottom Line\nApple's leaning on foreign markets for its revenue stream presents a mix of chances and challenges. Therefore, a vigilant watch on its international revenue movements can greatly aid in projecting the company's future direction.\nIn an era of growing international interdependencies and escalating geopolitical disputes, Wall Street analysts are vigilant in tracking these trends for businesses with a global reach, in order to refine their predictions of earnings. It should be noted, however, that a multitude of other elements, such as a company's domestic position, also play a significant role in shaping the earnings forecasts.\nWe at Zacks strongly focus on the dynamic earnings forecast of companies, given that empirical studies have demonstrated its potent impact on the immediate price movement of stocks. Invariably, there's a positive relationship -- upward earnings predictions often result in an increase in stock prices.\nOur proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, with its externally validated exceptional track record, harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions to serve as a dependable measure for anticipating the short-term price trends of stocks.\nApple, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nA Review of Apple's Recent Stock Market Performance\nOver the past month, the stock has seen an increase of 8.1% in its value, whereas the Zacks S&P 500 composite has posted a decrease of 1.6%. The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Apple's industry group, has descended 0.7% over the identical span.

        "Author": "  Aditya Soni ",
        "Text": "By Aditya Soni\n(Reuters) -Apple shares jumped 7% on Friday as the iPhone maker's record stock buyback plan and promise of sales growth brought back investors who have shunned the stock on concerns over weak demand and increased competition in China.\nThe company late on Thursday forecast fiscal third-quarter sales that exceeded Wall Street's modest expectations.\nIt also approved an additional $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest ever buyback authorization by a U.S. company, according to EPFR analyst Winston Chua.\nFriday's stock gain added nearly $200 billion to Apple's market capitalization, lifting it to $2.86 billion, second only to Microsoft, worth $3 trillion.\nAt Friday's stock price, executing Apple's full buyback authorization would amount to repurchasing nearly 4% of the company's shares.\nApple's forecast showed it is confident that product updates, starting with an iPad event on May 7, will drive demand in its hardware business after months of sluggish growth that made some investors doubt its status as a must-own stock.\n\"Many investors had begun to question if Apple still has what it takes to deliver the top growth they have become accustomed to over the years, but CEO Tim Cook turned on the charm and offered relief to investors,\" said Josh Gilbert, analyst at investment platform eToro.\nThe buyback aligned Apple with other U.S. tech giants that have showered investors with cash in recent earnings seasons to soothe concerns about rising investments in generative AI. Some analysts also saw it as a sign that the industry was maturing.\n\"Growth stocks must demonstrate they are still growing at a pace that satisfies their shareholders. Once that growth slows, and Apple is a prime example, then buybacks or dividends can persuade investors to keep the faith,\" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.\nUnlike Alphabet and Microsoft, Apple has not seen a cost surge as it has not made big AI investments. But the slow rollout of AI services has been punished by investors, which partly fueled the 10% drop in its share price this year.\nCEO Cook said Apple plans to share \"some very exciting things\", fanning expectations among several analysts that Apple would announce AI integrations at its upcoming annual developer conference, which is expected to be the biggest ever.\nBernstein analysts said they expected \"a strong iPhone 16 cycle fueled by AI functionality as well as elongated replacement cycles\".\nAt least 13 analysts raised their target price on Apple, pushing up the median view to $200, which is 15% higher than the stock's last closing price.\nApple's stock recently traded at 25 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with 30.5 for Microsoft. The Windows maker took the crown as the world's most valuable firm from Apple earlier this year, thanks to its AI efforts.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Sinead Carew in New York; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Title": "Apple Has a Problem -- and Investors Should Love It",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's tougher than you might think to be a $2.8 trillion company. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) faces a more challenging task to continue the success of its past the bigger it gets.\nThe tech giant announced its fiscal 2024 second-quarter results on Thursday. One thing was evident from this update: Apple has a problem-- and investors should love it.\nWhy would anyone be pleased that a company they've invested in is facing problems? Some problems are good ones to have.\nThat's the story with Apple. The iPhone maker has too much cash on its hands. As of March 30, 2024, Apple's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $162.3 billion. To put that number into perspective, it's greater than the market cap of 450 members of the S&P 500.\nThis problem is great for investors because of the actions Apple is taking because of its massive cash stockpile. The company plans to transition to a net cash-neutral position over time, where its cash and debt are equal. With Apple's total debt at close to $105 billion and quarterly operating cash flow of nearly $23 billion, it has a lot of cash to spend.\nApple announced last week that it's increasing its stock buyback program by a whopping $110 billion. This is the largest share repurchase authorization in the company's history. The more stock Apple buys back, the more its remaining outstanding shares will be worth.\nThat's not all. Apple is also raising its dividend payout by 4%, its 12 consecutive annual dividend increase. In the six months ending March 30, 2024, the company returned over $7.5 billion to shareholders through dividends.\nApple has a few other problems that aren't so lovable. The biggest is that the company's revenue fell 4% year over year in its fiscal Q2 to $90.8 billion. This decline is the result of contributing problems with several product lines.\niPhone sales sank nearly 10.5% year over year in the latest quarter to $45.9 billion. Around $5 billion of this negative trend was due to replenishment of channel inventory after COVID-related supply disruptions in the prior-year period.\niPad sales fell 16.7% year over year to $5.56 billion. The main culprit behind this decline was that Apple launched its M2 iPad Pro and the iPad 10th generation model last year.\nIt was a similar story for wearables, home, and accessories. Sales for this category slid 9.6% year over year to $7.91 billion primarily because of the tough comparisons with 2023 Q2 when Apple launched new version of its AirPods and Apple Watch.\nApple could have solutions on the way to some of these revenue problems. CEO Tim Cook said in the Q2 call Thursday evening the company will have \"an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love.\" He added that Apple's team \"can't wait to reveal what we have in store\" at the Worldwide Developers Conference next month.\nIt's a pretty safe bet that artificial intelligence (AI) will be at the heart of some of the upcoming announcements. Cook said, \"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era.\"\nI predict that Apple's AI innovations could kick off a new major upgrade cycle for iPhones (and maybe iPads, too). If I'm right, the company's sales should rebound in a big way. And I think these prospects, combined with the big stock buybacks and higher dividends, make Apple a stock investors can love again.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The market warmed to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) recent fiscal second-quarter earnings report, as did an analyst at J.P. Morgan, a heavyweight financial company. The analyst raised the price target from $210 to $225 per share while maintaining an \"overweight\" rating.\nThe upgrade follows a good set of results from the company that allayed fears over lagging iPhone sales, particularly in China. That might sound surprising in light of the fact that iPhone sales did decline 10.4% year over year in the quarter to $45.96 billion.\nHowever, as management noted on the earnings call, last year's fiscal second-quarter iPhone revenue was boosted by a \"one-time impact\" that added $5 billion to its sales, as it filled pent-up demand resulting from pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. Apple CEO Tim Cook said, \"Our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown,\" excluding this impact.\nThe analyst also noted that the guidance for the fiscal third quarter demonstrates the strength of the iPhone franchise and sets the company up nicely for the rest of 2024. It's hard to disagree. Management guided toward total revenue growth in the low single-digit range while expecting a 2.5% headwind from unfavorable foreign exchange movements \u2013 guidance implies as much as 5.5% organic growth.\nIn addition, after a 14% year-over-year increase in revenue from its high-margin services segment in the fiscal second quarter, management expects another quarter of double-digit growth. Sales gains in services continue to transform Apple's margin profile, as gross profit margins there come in near 75%, compared to 36.6% for products. Services made up just over a quarter of Apple's overall revenue, compared to 22% in the same quarter last year. Apple's overall gross margins improved to 46.6% from 44.3%.\nApple is in a prime position to reap the benefits of incorporating artificial intelligence into its iPhones due to its impressive sales figures and sustained growth in services revenue.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Yuvraj Malik ",
        "Text": "By Yuvraj Malik\n(Reuters) -Apple's plan to add generative AI to its iPhones and revive sagging sales in the crucial Chinese market will be in focus on Thursday, when the tech giant is expected to report its biggest quarterly revenue decline in more than a year.\nLong considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling more than 10% this year as fears mount about its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence services and as a resurgent Huawei takes market share in China.\nAnalysts on average see iPhone sales, which account for about half of Apple's revenue, falling 10.4% in the first three months of 2024, according to LSEG. That drop would be the steepest in more than three years.\nThe year-ago iPhone revenue that the 10.4% iPhone sales drop is measured against was unusually high as Apple satisfied pent-up demand after the COVID pandemic, company executives previously noted.\nAt least $5 billion of the $51.3 billion in iPhone sales a year ago was essentially catching up from disruptions in the December 2022 quarter when COVID lockdowns in China hampered iPhone production, executives said.\nEven with that factored in, Wall Street expects a slight decline in iPhone sales, and analysts estimate Apple's total revenue declined 5% in its fiscal second quarter ended in March. That would be Apple's biggest revenue decline since the December 2022 quarter, when revenue fell 5.5%.\nApple earlier this year lost the crown of the world's most valuable company to Microsoft. Its market value stands at $2.68 trillion after the share price declined 11.24% so far this year.\nWeak revenue and falling shares have pressured Apple to spruce up its flagship device after years without major upgrades.\nThe company is in talks with OpenAI and Alphabet-owned Google to add genAI features for the iPhone that could be unveiled at what is expected to be its biggest-ever annual developer conference in June, Bloomberg News has reported.\nAnalysts believe such an AI integration could drive demand for the next iPhone series, expected to be announced in the fall.\nWhile executives at Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other major technology firms have talked up their AI strategies on quarterly conference calls in recent months, Apple CEO Tim Cook has discussed his plans for the emerging technology much less.\nAdding AI features to iPhones could also help Apple to compete better with Huawei and Samsung Electronics, which reclaimed the title of the world's top smartphone vendor from Apple this year, driven by demand for the AI features in its Galaxy S24 smartphones.\n\"Replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle,\" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said this week as he upgraded the company's shares to \"outperform\" from \"market-perform.\"\n\"We believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note historically Apple's China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base.\"\nThursday's earnings will also be watched closely for updates on the company's stock buyback plan and the Vision Pro, Apple's first major product in years that hit the shelves in February.\nAfter initial enthusiasm, there have been signs that demand slowed for the $3,500 device, with an analyst saying this month that Apple has pulled back its production estimates for the mixed-reality headset.\nThe rest of the company's hardware business is also reeling from soft demand, with iPads and Mac sales expected to fall 11.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the March quarter.\nApple has signaled it is sharpening its focus on the devices, which have also been hobbled by a lack of major upgrades.\nAt an Apple event this month, a revamped iPad line-up is expected to be unveiled and media reports have said that it plans to update every Mac model with faster, AI-focused M4 processors.\nThe services business, which includes App Store and subscription services such as Apple TV, is expected to remain a bright spot with revenue growth of 7.7%.\nApple shares closed down 0.6% at $169.30 on Wednesday.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Richard Chang)\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s been more than 18 months since Apple Inc. last updated its iPad line, marking the longest gap in new models since Steve Jobs first unveiled the product in 2010. The drought finally ends on May 7.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial\nAmericans Are Racking Up \u2018Phantom Debt\u2019 That Wall Street Can\u2019t Track\nOne Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire\nTrump\u2019s Private Life Exposed in Intimate Stormy Daniels Testimony\nThat\u2019s the day Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is poised to introduce major upgrades to the iPad Pro and iPad Air, as well as new versions of the tablet\u2019s accessories. The company is delivering the news through an online event dubbed \u201cLet Loose\u201d that\u2019s expected to last a little more than half an hour.\nIn a shift, Apple is making the presentation at 7 a.m. Pacific time, three hours earlier than usual. That will mean the Tuesday event is squarely within business hours for Apple\u2019s European fans, and \u2014 perhaps more importantly \u2014 something people in Asia can watch before going to bed. Boosting sales in China is a major focus for the company right now.\nIt\u2019s also a critical moment for the iPad business. Following a pandemic-era sales surge, demand has declined in the past two years. The iPad\u2019s sales were particularly weak last quarter, when they plunged 17% and missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Apple predicted that iPad revenue will rebound in the current period, and it\u2019s counting on the new models to help win back consumers.\nUnlike with Apple\u2019s bigger product launches \u2014 the Worldwide Developers Conference in June and its iPhone reveal in September \u2014 there won\u2019t be a major in-person gathering at the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California. Instead, Apple is holding smaller hands-on sessions in New York and London, where members of the media will be able to watch the video announcement and try out the devices.\nHere are the new products to expect at the event \u2014 and what probably won\u2019t come until later:\nThe New iPads:\nThe star of the event will be a new iPad Pro with an updated design and crisper screen. It will be the first iPad to get an OLED display \u2014 organic light-emitting diode \u2014 the technology used in the iPhone since 2017. In addition to improving the image quality, OLEDs allow for thinner devices, and Apple is expected to slim down the Pro tablet accordingly. The new iPads are poised to come in 11-inch and 12.9-inch screen sizes and may also include Apple\u2019s first M4 processors. Those chips will help power artificial intelligence tasks \u2014 part of a broader push into AI that Apple will explain further in June.\nThe iPad Air, Apple\u2019s mid-tier tablet, is getting updated on Tuesday as well. The big story there is that Apple will add a second, larger screen option for the first time. The new 12.9-inch version will match the size of the iPad Pro, giving consumers a cheaper way to get a large-screen tablet. The current 10.9-inch version will stick around, and both models will likely be updated with the M2 chip that Apple first launched in the MacBook Air in 2022.\nUpdated Accessories:\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Apple Pencil will feature prominently in Tuesday\u2019s presentation: The company depicted the device in the invitation to the event. The revamped Pencil will include haptic feedback, a feature that lets users feel a small vibration-like effect when triggering actions with the stylus. Users will probably also be able to squeeze the Pencil to conduct certain tasks. The accessory was last updated in 2023, when Apple rolled out a new low-end version. The new one will be a replacement for the high-end model launched in 2018.\nApple also will unveil an updated Magic Keyboard, a piece of equipment that serves as an iPad case and includes a keyboard and small trackpad. The new version is expected to be more durable, use aluminum and make the iPad look more laptop-like. Users have complained that the current version can tear or fall apart after several months of use.\nComing Later:\nApple is working on a cost-reduced version of its 10th-generation iPad. That model is currently $449, but Apple will probably want to get the price closer to the $329 ninth-generation model \u2014 a move that would let it phase out that older version. But such a step isn\u2019t expected until the end of the year at the earliest.\nThe company is also planning an updated iPad mini, which was previously revamped in 2021. That new model, featuring a faster processor, also won\u2019t be coming on Tuesday.\nNew AI capabilities may get teased for the iPad Pro, but don\u2019t expect a formal unveiling of the software features until June. That\u2019s when Apple will introduce iPadOS 18 at its Worldwide Developers Conference.\nThe company is also nearing production of revamped low-end AirPods, but those won\u2019t be launched until the fall \u2014 alongside new iPhones.\nFinally, Macs aren\u2019t expected to be part of the event. Though the iPad Pro may include the company\u2019s M4 chip \u2014 a component that\u2019s also coming to the Mac \u2014 new computers won\u2019t arrive until later in 2024.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home\nTesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger\nThe Company Preaching America\u2019s Nuclear Revival\nBoom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That\u2019s a Good Thing\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple stock (AAPL) rose as much as 6% early on Friday after the tech giant reported earnings that beat forecasts, sales that fell less than feared, and announced a new $110 billion share repurchase plan.\nThe iPhone maker reported late Thursday second quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.53 on revenue of $90.8 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $1.50 on revenue of $90.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nApple's Greater China revenue, which includes mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, slid 8% year over year to $16.37 billion. That, however, was better than the $15.87 billion analysts were expecting. Apple CFO Luca Maestri told Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton that the company saw growth in mainland China during the quarter.\nThe company's all-important iPhone revenue totaled $45.96 billion, down from $51.33 billion in Q2 last year. Apple also announced it was authorizing an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and increased its dividend to $0.25 per share. Shareholder returns plans have become a feature of Big Tech results this year, with Meta initiating a dividend in February and Alphabet announcing its own plans to start paying a dividend late last month.\nAhead of Thursday's report, Apple stock had been down 10% this year, lagging many of its Big Tech peers and the broader market.\nIn its fiscal second quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.45 billion versus an anticipated $6.79 billion, while iPad revenue hit $5.55 billion. Analysts were expecting $5.91 billion. Wearables, which include AirPods, the Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, saw revenue of $7.91 billion. Wall Street was looking for $8.28 billion.\nAnother bright spot for Apple in the quarter: Services revenue hit $23.87 billion, up from $20.91 billion last year, an all-time record. Analysts were expecting $23.28 billion.\nOn its earnings call, Apple also said it expects current quarter revenue growth to be in the low single digits. Services revenues are expected to grow by double digits and at a rate similar to what the company saw in the first half of its fiscal year.\nJPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a client note late Thursday these results are \"setting up a strong launch pad for the company in relation to results in FY24 as focus turns to the impending AI smartphone upgrade cycle in the coming years.\" Following the results, JPMorgan maintained its Overweight rating on the stock and raised its price target to $225 per share from $210.\nApple is also gearing up for its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, where it will reportedly unveil the latest versions of its iOS, macOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and visionOS operating systems. One of the biggest announcements at the show will likely be how Apple will integrate generative AI into its various products.\nOn the company's earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said, \"We believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era.\"\nIn a note to clients following the report, Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani wrote: \"We think a set of positive catalysts should help drive the stock higher as we go into WWDC where AAPL will provide details around their AI strategy across both hardware and services. We think Apple can deliver AI upside without the AI capex we see elsewhere.\" Evercore maintained its Outperform rating and $220 price target on the stock.\nApple may be relatively late to the generative AI party, with rivals across Big Tech already rolling out their own product offerings to consumers and enterprise customers. Still, the company has been busy buying up AI firms and building its own large language model to potentially power its AI efforts.\nAnd Maestri told Yahoo Finance that the company is making significant investments in generative AI technologies. Apple is also looking to work with OpenAI, Google, and others to get its AI offerings up to snuff, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Apple unveils new AI-focused chip in upgraded iPad Pro",
        "Author": "  Stephen Nellis ",
        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) -Apple unveiled its latest iPad Pro on Tuesday with a new chip for artificial intelligence computing as it rushes to catch up with its Big Tech rivals in a race to dominate the emerging technology. Debuting its latest chip in a tablet rather than its Mac laptops is unusual for Apple, and suggests it is eager to give app makers a head start creating AI-related software ahead of its annual software developer conference next month, analysts said.\nThe announcements did little to move Apple's stock, which was last up about 0.5% after gaining as much as 1.8% earlier in the day.\nWhile Microsoft and Alphabet have dived headlong into AI and seen their stocks surge to record highs, Apple's shares have fallen 5% in the year to date as it struggles with weak iPhone demand, and as investors wait for it to show how it will leverage AI technology.\nApple said the iPad Pro - its highest-priced model - will have upgraded displays and start at $1,000 for an 11-inch (27.9-cm) model and $1,300 for a 13-inch (33-cm) model.\nIt will come with an M4 chip with a larger \"neural engine,\" part of the chip specifically designed for the kind of computing required by AI features such as generating text or images.\nApple chips have featured a neural engine since 2017, but rivals such as Intel and Qualcomm tout competitive technologies, which they refer to as neural processing units, or NPUs, for personal computers.\n\"With this level of performance, the neural engine and M4 is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today,\" Tim Millet, vice president of platform architecture at Apple, said during the presentation.\nApple also introduced new models of its mid-priced iPad Air, which will now come in a larger 13-inch screen size at $800, as well as the 11-inch size it previously came in for $600. Those tablets come with Apple's M2 chip, which came to market in Apple's MacBooks in 2022.\nPrecisely what AI features the new M4 chips could power might not become clear until June 10 at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference, where it often shows new capabilities for Siri its voice assistant, as well as the rest of its operating systems.\n\"Essentially, (there was) a lot of foreshadowing on where they can or will go with generative AI on their hardware,\u201d Ben Bajarin, chief executive of consulting firm Creative Strategies, said of Tuesday's product launch.\nFor now, many AI features - such as helping zoom in on a user during a video call - are not likely to inspire a wave of upgrades, according to some analysts.\n\"Is it really enough for people to look into it and buy them? Probably not,\" said Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner. \"It has to be some kind of remarkable experience.\"\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook said last week the company is \"very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI\" and plans to make more announcements later this year.\nThomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said Apple has historically used the iPad line as a place to try new technologies with lower risk than bigger products like the iPhone or Mac.\n\"Against this backdrop, I do not think Tim Cook\u2019s main aim here is to solve Apple\u2019s sales problem with this line specifically, but rather to lay the groundwork needed for better, more innovative products in the months ahead,\" Monteiro said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Max Chearney in San Francisco and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors have been on a roller coaster in recent years, with an economic downturn bringing the iPhone maker's stock plunging 27% in 2022. The company's shares rebounded 48% the following year. However, repeated hits to its business and revenue declines throughout 2023 have seen its stock dip 1% since the start of this year.\nWall Street has grown wary of Apple's iPhone-dependent business as macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to a decline in product sales. However, recent quarterly results and moves to prioritize more digital businesses suggest the company is moving in a better direction.\nApple's digital services segment consistently outpaces the iPhone and is on track to become its highest-earning division. Meanwhile, a gradual expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) could see the company profit from the tailwinds of a $200 billion (and growing) industry for years. As a result, now could be the best time to invest in Apple, as it is at the start of a major shift in its business model.\nSo, here are three reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.\nApple's services segment includes income from its App Store and subscription-based platforms like Apple TV+, Music, Fitness+, and more. The bulk of the company's services launched in 2019, and the division quickly became the most profitable part of Apple's business.\nServices regularly hit gross margins above 70%, achieving 75% in the second quarter of 2024 (a year-over-year improvement of about 4%). For reference, products' profit margins hover around 36%.\nMoreover, its services consistently outperform those of Apple's other segments. Q2 2024 saw revenue for the digital business rise 14% year over year, while iPhone sales fell 10% and iPad revenue tumbled 17%.\nServices have diversified and strengthened Apple's business, allowing it to lean less on product sales amid poor market conditions. The segment is expanding rapidly, illustrating a promising shift in Apple's priorities from physical offerings to its more profitable digital products.\nDespite recent challenges, Apple remains a behemoth in consumer tech. Thanks to nearly unrivaled brand loyalty, the company dominates multiple product markets, with leading market shares in smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. Sales have dipped over the last year, but the company is making moves to boost its product business with AI.\nApple has gradually added AI-enabled features to its product lineup since the start of 2023, but now it appears to be quickening the pace. On May 7, the company hosted its \"Let Loose\" event, where it debuted its newest iPad Pro -- the first device powered by Apple's new M4 chip.\nThe chip is Apple's most powerful one yet, considerably expanding the company's AI capabilities. The launch appears to be a preview of what Apple will reveal at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, where experts believe it will debut a range of new AI-powered tools.\nMoreover, Bloomberg reported last month that Apple plans to overhaul its Mac line of computers to focus on AI and is powering its AI software with data centers filled with in-house-designed chips.\nApple's dominance in consumer tech could land it a lucrative role in AI. While companies like Microsoft and Amazon are primarily focused on the commercial side of AI, Apple has honed in on consumers. The widespread use of its products could see Apple become a significant growth driver in the public's adoption of AI, improving its recent product slump and boosting revenue for years.\nOn May 2, Apple announced the biggest stock buyback in history, revealing plans to buy back $110 billion worth of stock. The move saw shares in Apple pop 8% in after-market trading, instilling some confidence in investors for the company's future.\nBuybacks often occur because executives believe the company's stock is undervalued. As a result, a major buyback could be a sign that management believes in the direction Apple is moving in, making its stock an attractive option.\nApple has faced more than a few challenges over the last year, but I wouldn't bet against its long-term future. Its stock is trading 29 times its forward earnings, compared to Microsoft's 35 times and Amazon's 40 times. It may not be a bargain, but the figures suggest Apple could be one of the best-valued stocks in AI. Alongside a lucrative services business, Apple is worth buying like there's no tomorrow.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) latest 13-inch iPad Pro is a marvel of engineering.\nBut software still hamstrings the iPad Pro\u2019s true potential, relegating the device to a sleek, high-end package for consuming content rather than allowing the iPad Pro to realize its productivity potential.\nThe company has packed its latest M4 processor with up to 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, more than you\u2019ll find in its current MacBook Air and at least one version of its MacBook Pro, into a tablet thinner than Apple\u2019s iPod Nano.\nAt just 5.1 millimeters thick, the iPad Pro feels like if you hold it by one end, the other will droop like a piece of loose-leaf paper. It doesn\u2019t, of course. The 11-inch iPad Pro is almost as thin at 5.3 mm.\nOh, and then there\u2019s the new Ultra Retina XDR display. Apple says the screen combines two OLED panels to boost its overall brightness while offering the same exceptional benefits you\u2019d get out of a normal OLED display. That means inky blacks and brilliant colors.\nAnd all of that is going to cost you. A base 13-inch iPad Pro with Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard will set you back $1,648. That\u2019s more than a high-end 13-inch MacBook Air and an entry-level MacBook Pro.\nI could deal with that price, though, if the iPad Pro didn\u2019t have one big setback \u2014 iPadOS.\nOver the years, the iPad has made progress toward offering more Mac-like capabilities.\nYou can run multiple apps at the same time, connect to an external display for a larger workspace, group apps together, and more.\nBut iPadOS still holds back the iPad Pro from its true potential.\nI\u2019ve written this entire review on the iPad Pro. And while it\u2019s served me well, I\u2019m still limited by how I can arrange windows. The fact that I can only run four apps on screen at the same time without having to grab them from the side panel and that apps still default to their iPad versions rather than a full Mac version are among the biggest roadblocks.\nIt\u2019s these kinds of things that make it hard to use the iPad Pro as a full laptop replacement, even though that\u2019s clearly how Apple wants you to think of the tablet.\nTo say I\u2019m torn is an understatement. I love how powerful the iPad Pro is, how gorgeous its display is, and how incredibly thin it is. But I also want it to do more with all of that than it does.\nApple is clearly worried that if it turns the iPad Pro into more of a Mac, it\u2019ll cannibalize MacBook sales.\nAnd that\u2019s probably true. After all, if you\u2019ve got the cash to burn, an iPad Pro with macOS would be easy to recommend over the MacBook Air.\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Air loses its value, though: It would still serve as a fantastic entry-level laptop for Apple while the MacBook Pro would continue to stand as the company\u2019s most powerful portable computer.\nThe new iPad Pro blows away most super thin laptops on the market.\nIts massive touch screen is fantastic, the Magic Keyboard is as responsive and comfortable to type on as a standard MacBook, and its trackpad is spacious and offers haptic feedback when you click it.\nOn top of that, it\u2019s got a new camera on the right side that, when you\u2019re using the iPad Pro in landscape mode, acts as a solid front camera that automatically keeps you in frame via its Center Stage feature. Stereo speakers also help when you want to use it as your mini TV on the go or for meetings or whatever.\nAnd did I mention its M4 chip is absurd for how thin this tablet is? I ran the Geekbench benchmark, which tests the performance of the CPU, on the iPad Pro and my wife\u2019s 2023 MacBook Air with an M2 processor, and the iPad practically suplexed the Air straight through my coffee table. Figuratively, speaking.\nIt also easily beat out my 2021 MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip and 32GB of RAM.\nThere's no way around it \u2014 the 13-inch iPad Pro is an absolute monster, especially for its size.\nApple will host its annual WWDC event on June 10, and there\u2019s an outside chance the company could announce an update to the iPad Pro that will make it a true laptop killer. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for.\nAnd if you\u2019re in the market for a high-powered iPad that knocks the socks off of any other tablet, the Pro is the way to go. If you can get around Apple\u2019s software decisions, then you should also grab one.\nBut if you\u2019re hoping this Pro is the laptop replacement you\u2019ve been waiting for, you\u2019re out of luck.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- A senior Apple Inc. executive told a US judge that the iPhone maker\u2019s new 27% fee on purchases made outside its App Store are a good-faith attempt to comply with the law.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWall Street Moves to Fastest Settlement of Trades in a Century\nIsraeli Airstrike and Egyptian Guard\u2019s Death Ratchet Up Tensions\nFor Private Credit\u2019s Top Talent, $1 Million a Year Is Not Enough\nCatering to the Ultra-Rich Is a Booming Business in Australia\nStocks Fluctuate After Consumer Confidence Report: Markets Wrap\n\u201cWe are trying to enable what the law requires,\u201d Apple Fellow Philip Schiller said Friday during the fourth day of a hearing focused on Apple\u2019s compliance. \u201cThere was mentioned in the order about if Apple has a right to a fee even without\u201d developers using its in-app payment system.\nSchiller, a long-time executive who helped develop the App Store, is the most senior executive to testify at the hearing before US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California. She is deciding whether Apple\u2019s new fees comply with her 2021 order that the iPhone maker must allow developers to provide links to cheaper payment options online.\nSchiller, who took the stand late Friday for about 90 minutes, said he was one of the three senior Apple executives who decided to impose the new fee in January along with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Luca Maestri. Under questioning by Gary Bornstein, a lawyer for Fortnite-maker Epic Games Inc., Schiller said he isn\u2019t opposed to the link requirement despite prior public comments that it would \u201cdetract from the user experience.\u201d\n\u2018Safe\u2019 Solution\n\u201cThe world has changed and linking out is being required,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not have a preference against link-out. I want to make the solution safe for our customers. That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on.\u201d\nEarlier in the hearing, Apple\u2019s attempts to justify the 27% fee backfired as Rogers questioned another executive about a company-commissioned study showing half that rate would be reasonable.\nCarson Oliver, senior director for business management for the App Store, testified that Apple hired economic consulting firm Analysis Group Inc. to help create a new commission rate for purchases.\nBut Rogers repeatedly chastised Oliver for statements about how Apple decided it would charge developers 27% for purchases of digital goods or services made outside its App Store, given that the lowest end of the range in the Analysis Group study is 12.3%.\n\u201cHow did you justify the other 15% you are charging?\u201d she said.\nServices to Developers\nApple provides a number of services to developers including discovery of apps, distribution, developer tools and platform technology, along with additional privacy, user trust and safety that aren\u2019t comparable to other platforms, Oliver testified. He said Apple estimates the true low-end was 17%.\nAnalysis Group estimated what each of those categories was worth by comparing them to what is charged by platforms including Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Etsy Inc. and Shopify Inc.\nThe Analysis Group study found the value of those services would amount to between 12.3% at the low end or 92% at the high end depending on factors like the size of the developer, Oliver said.\n\u201cAnd you are charging 27%,\u201d Rogers interjected.\nOliver said Apple executives believe the effective rate of the commission is lower than that.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big assumption,\u201d the judge replied. \u201cYour assumptions are just that \u2014 they are assumptions. There\u2019s no data for it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Oliver said.\nSchiller is expected to continue his testimony on May 22 when the hearing resumes.\n(Corrects name of lawyer in fourth paragraph of May 17 story.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNew York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point\nThe Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t\nWhen Business Is Just a Game\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) recent streak of revenue declines might soon reverse thanks to a refreshed lineup of products, and the stock is unambiguously a buy. That's the post-earnings take on the company from one analyst following the company. After the May 2 publication of the high-profile tech company's latest quarterly report, he reiterated his bullish view of the stock.\nThat optimistic analyst is CFRA's Angelo Zino, who pegs Apple as a buy with a price target of $210. That implies 15% upside from the stock's current level.\nApple is best known for its products, although it's the company's ever-growing lineup of services that's on the rise. They collectively brought it nearly $24 billion in the tech giant's recently published quarter, which was a 14% improvement year-over-year. Going in the opposite direction, product sales declined by 10% to almost $67 billion.\nSomewhat counterintuitively, Zino feels Apple's potential lies in that slumping segment. He pointed out that the company has revamped its iPad lineup with larger and more powerful devices. Also, the release of its new M4 chip, \"indicates how Aple is looking to accelerate hardware capabilities to meet potential new artificial intelligence (AI) apps/software capabilities,\" he wrote.\nApple is a driven, restless company that's always looking to have the most advanced and attractive devices on the market.\nWhile I feel it's been years since it turned the world around with a product -- anyone remember the excitement over the original iPhone in 2007? -- those Apple Stores sure are crowded places these days.

Profit also topped Wall Street projections in the period, and Apple announced the biggest stock buyback in US history.\nThe shares rallied as much as 8.1% to $187 Friday morning in New York. It was the biggest intraday gain since November 2022. Apple had been down 10% this year before results were released on Thursday.\nRead More: Apple\u2019s $110 Billion Stock Buyback Plan is Largest in US History\nThe results came as a relief to investors, who have been waiting for the iPhone maker to pull out of a long slump. Apple has posted sales declines in five of the past six quarters, hurt by a sluggish smartphone market and headwinds in China. The company had warned analysts in February that revenue in the latest period would be down about 5% from a year earlier.\nIn the current period, Apple expects sales to climb by a percentage in the low single digits. The company predicted that both its iPad and services business would grow by a rate in the double digits, but declined to give a forecast for the iPhone \u2014 its flagship product.\nEarnings amounted to $1.53 a share in the fiscal second quarter, which ended March 30. That exceeded the $1.50 analysts had estimated. Apple increased its dividend 4% to 25 cents a share, in line with expectations. And the board approved plans to buy back an additional $110 billion of the company\u2019s stock.\nA lack of innovative new devices has contributed to slow sales at Apple, but the company looks to begin rectifying that on May 7. That\u2019s when it plans to unveil new iPads \u2014 the first updates to its tablet line in 1 1/2 years.\nRead More: Apple to Hold Launch Event on May 7, With New iPads Expected\nThe Cupertino, California-based company also is planning a long-awaited push into generative artificial intelligence. In June, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is expected to lay out Apple\u2019s AI strategy at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\u201cWe are making significant investments in the space,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Emily Chang. \u201cWe believe we are well-positioned.\u201d\nCook said Thursday that Apple will stand out from its AI rivals by tightly integrating hardware and software, using in-house chips, and making privacy and security a priority.\nApple\u2019s slowdown in China has been of particular concern to investors in recent months. Consumers there are flocking to homegrown smartphone brands, and the government has banned the use of foreign technology in some offices.\nCounterpoint Research estimated that sales of the iPhone nosedived 19% in China during the first three months of the year, the product\u2019s worst quarter since 2020. Worldwide, shipments of the device fell nearly 10% in the quarter, according to IDC, marking the steepest drop since Covid lockdowns snarled supply chains in 2022.\nAgainst that backdrop, Apple\u2019s China results were more upbeat than expected. The company generated $16.4 billion in revenue from greater China last quarter. Though that number was down from a year earlier, it handily beat the $15.9 billion analysts had predicted.\nRead More: Apple\u2019s China iPhone Sales Dive 19% in Worst Quarter Since 2020\nMaestri said that the China concerns were overblown. \u201cWe were happy with our results in China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is different from maybe what you read at times.\u201d\nCook also pushed back on the idea that the iPhone was suffering in the country, saying that revenue from the device actually grew in mainland China. The weakness stemmed from other parts of the business, he said.\n\u201cOther products didn\u2019t fare as well,\u201d he said on a conference call. \u201cAnd so we clearly have work there to do.\u201d\nAt the same time, Apple hasn\u2019t shown that new product categories can reinvigorate growth. It canceled work on a self-driving car in February, eliminating a project that some had hoped could become one of its famous \u201cnext big things.\u201d\nThe company did push into the mixed-reality headset market this year, with the Feb. 2 debut of the Vision Pro. But that product is off to a slow start and could take years before it adds meaningfully to Apple\u2019s revenue. Apple didn\u2019t disclose Vision Pro sales figures on Thursday, but said that the device is generating interest among corporate customers.\nThe company\u2019s biggest moneymaker remains the iPhone, which accounts for about half of sales. The product generated revenue of $46 billion in the second quarter, topping estimates of $45.8 billion. That was a sharp decline from the $51.3 billion Apple reported in the year-ago quarter \u2014 despite the fact that the latest model was considered to be a substantial upgrade.\nApple is planning to upgrade the iPhone this year with slightly bigger screens and new chips focused on AI. The Pro models also will add a new button for capturing photo and video, but they\u2019ll otherwise look the same as current versions.\nThe iPad business continued its decline last quarter, with revenue coming in at $5.56 billion. That missed the average analyst estimate of $5.91 billion. For the first time in the product\u2019s history, Apple went an entire calendar year without upgrading the iPad\u2019s hardware. The device will fare better in the current quarter, with pent-up demand helping fuel sales of the models set to be unveiled next week.\nThe Mac generated $7.45 billion in sales, beating the $6.79 billion projection. The business got a boost from the new MacBook Air, which was updated in March with an M3 chip. Apple is planning to release its first Macs with M4 processors later this year, adding a fresh focus on AI capabilities, Bloomberg News has reported.\nRead More: Apple to Overhaul Entire Mac Line With AI-Focused M4 Chips\nApple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment brought in $7.91 billion revenue. That compares with estimates of $8.29 billion and represents a nearly 10% decline from the year-ago quarter. The latest Apple Watch models were only minor upgrades, and the company hasn\u2019t resolved litigation surrounding a disabled feature for calculating blood-oxygen saturation.\nServices were a relative bright spot, growing 14% to $23.9 billion in revenue. That topped Wall Street expectations of $23.3 billion. The category includes Apple Music, the TV+ streaming platform and iCloud subscriptions, but its revenue primarily comes from the App Store.\nThat business is under pressure from regulators, with Apple being forced to allow third-party marketplaces and payment services in the European Union.

        "Title": "Apple May Require a Gradual Strategic Shift to Maintain Growth",
        "Author": "  Oliver Rodzianko ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the second-largest company in the world at the time of writing, and many investors are concerned the company may be past its high-growth stage. However, I believe the investment could still have a useful place in portfolios that are looking for good returns at a lower risk.\nMy own opinion on the stock over the long term is that it will certainly not contract in value in the next 10 years, but that its value accretion will be more moderate. Additionally, if management does not effectively shift the company's financial strategy to meet long-term growth opportunities and mitigate present growth risks, which are vastly different now compared to historically due to its size, Apple's stock could start to depreciate in value.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with SBSW.\nThere are valid concerns at the moment about how Apple's growth might slow down in the coming years due to how saturated its markets are. In addition, I believe that with the absence of Steve Jobs as CEO, the company could undeniably face issues in vision and technology development in the future. Even though I admire Tim Cook's management and believe Apple hosts some of the best talent in the world, it is leading that talent with an effective long-term vision which is paramount, and it is very difficult to match the late founder in this regard. I will discuss in the following sections how I believe Apple's negation of developing a real moat in artificial intelligence infrastructure is a mistake and that it may need to shift its focus away from consumer goods as its primary value-add to a higher focus on investment operations, similar to how Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) operates, with a strategy of portfolio management of technology companies that operate under the umbrella of Apple. I believe that a failure to do this could mean the firm eventually plateaus in growth and, over the next few decades, sees its share price depreciate as a result.\nWhile Apple's transition into services and its large moat in the app store is admirable, it is facing significant pushback from regulatory bodies for monopoly practices. I believe this is a bad reputation for Apple to be getting, and it also highlights a critical issue. The company is preventing innovative upstarts from flourishing through negative app store ecosystem payment rules, which are eating away at the potential earnings these newer players will depend on for their survival. Instead of investing in these companies, as I have alluded to would be wise in my analysis here, Apple is trying to capitalize off of them without necessarily astutely supporting their long-term growth.\nIn essence, I think this is a bad strategy and is not conducive to long-term flourishment for Apple unless it changes its strategy somewhat. The tech giant has changed its commission structure for small developers, but I still think it could be more generous if it began a more thorough investment strategy, which could bolster long-term growth and open up its services and ecosystem for use in a more egalitarian way.\nBecause Apple is the second-largest company in the world by market cap, there is very little room for inefficiencies in the valuation. As the GF Value chart indicates, the stock is fairly valued at the time of writing. Recently, the company's valuation multiples have increased somewhat. However, this is warranted due to the fact its earnings growth rates without non-recurring items have been increasing over the past decade.\nThe main concern I have with the valuation is that, at the moment, it is still notably high, even if fair. I believe that if the company's growth reduces significantly over the long term because it fails to effectively pivot in a manner similar to my operations forecast above, the market could deem Apple's valuation a problem and begin a significant sell-off. After a potential significant correction, if the company is not managed with stock price growth in mind over the next decade, it could enter a new period of earnings contraction and share price depreciation. This is something we definitely do not want to see as shareholders, which is why Apple will have to focus carefully on its capital allocation strategies to maintain long-term growth in line with the broader economy as a baseline from here on out.\nA significant slowdown in Apple's growth could occur if it ineffectively harnesses its acquisitions in AI to produce a moat in machine and deep learning capabilities, products and services. I believe that AI is going to absolutely transform the technology industry and will have far-reaching effects on every industry in the world. I believe it is a massive mistake for Apple to sideline AI or even outsource the most advanced tasks. Before his death in 2011, Jobs was involved in bringing Siri to the market through an acquisition led by Apple's leadership in 2010, which was arguably one of the first AI implementations in consumer technology. However, today, with the recent AI surge, which I posit was driven largely by OpenAI, Apple showed that it was not at the forefront of this innovation, but instead is having to adapt accordingly. Based on my analysis and research, the company wants to harness AI tools to create the best consumer goods rather than have a moat in any real sense in AI technology, tools or infrastructure. Its focus has been on deploying AI in its hardware and software ecosystems, with less noticeably visible offerings for consumers. To me, this is a mistake and will significantly negatively impact shareholder value over the long term as AI becomes the largest value-add in the modern technology industry in history.\nIn many respects, despite Apple's size, it is already behind on the AI front. Even considering its 25 acquisitions of AI companies from 2016 to 2020 and 32 AI startups being acquired in 2023, the question here is not acquiring the talent; it is what Apple does with the talent that is paramount. This reiterates my point that Jobs was known to be ruthless in the pursuit of technological excellence and vision. Without him, I believe the company's focus on consumer goods as its primary value-add could begin to wane over the long term. Its strategic shift to technology investments rather than fully integrated acquisitions could broaden its growth opportunities and allow for a deeper ecosystem of growth to strengthen it over the long term.\nApple may still be a big player in the game, but I believe it is quite telling that Microsoft has recently overtaken it. I think what Microsoft has over Apple, which is incredibly astute, is a business strategy that is similar to portfolio management but focused on technology. I believe this was instilled in Microsoft by Bill Gates (Trades, Portfolio), and while I think Apple's consumer products have been the best in the world up until now, I think due to its size and the loss of Jobs, Apple's executive management has to navigate a shift in strategy to meet long-term financial growth targets that shareholders will want.\nIn many respects, Apple is at a critical crossroads and must navigate its future carefully. As such, I will hold the stock, but not at too high a weight in my portfolio until I see the shifts needed to maintain growth over the long term.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) artificial intelligence push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros, which pack an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit.\nBut it was Apple\u2019s focus on the M4\u2019s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.\nBut the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will present at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.\nApple pointed to a number of the M4\u2019s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip\u2019s AI performance.\nMillet also said that the M4\u2019s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That\u2019s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops.\nOutside of the M4\u2019s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly.\nThe company also didn\u2019t provide information about the M4\u2019s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips\u2019 strengths.\nStill, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important.\nThe company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple\u2019s big AI coming-out party.\nCEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months and said during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.\nThat includes buying up smaller AI firms, and, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, holding talks with both OpenAI and Google about potentially using their large language models to power Apple\u2019s AI experiences.\nAnalysts expect Apple\u2019s generative AI offerings to serve as a catalyst in helping to boost iPhone sales at a time when consumers are increasingly holding on to their phones longer and splashy new features differentiating one generation from another are in short supply.\nNow, Apple just has to deliver.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Since then, Apple has received just 38 applications for outside links out of an estimated 65,000 app developers that offer in-app purchases, company executives testified.\nThe reason: Apple will charge a 27% fee to developers who want to use the link entitlement program \u2014 and when combined with payment processing fees, the total is even more than the 30% the App Store has taken for itself for years, the judge was told at the hearing in Oakland, California.\nWhy App Store Fees Are Drawing Fire Worldwide: QuickTake\nYears of complaints from app developers and scrutiny from governments globally have already forced Apple to rewrite some of the rules protecting its dominance in the app distribution marketplace that generates revenue of more than $200 billion a year.\nEpic has argued that Apple\u2019s January revisions to the App Store\u2019s rules don\u2019t amount to meaningful changes, while Apple contends it has delivered the remedy Rogers ordered three years ago following a trial between the two companies.\nRogers indicated that Apple hasn\u2019t convinced her it has done enough. Testimony revealed that the 27% fee was approved by a committee that included Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and other top executives.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me a thousand people were involved and not one of them said maybe we should consider the cost\u201d to the developers? the judge said. \u201cNot a single person raised that issue of the thousand that were involved?\u201d\nNone of the 38 applications for the new outside payments program came from developers of major apps, said Apple\u2019s vice president of finance, Alex Roman.\nRead More: Google\u2019s Defeat Threatens $200 Billion App Store Industry\nAt one point, an attorney for Epic, Yonatan Even, questioned Roman about whether there is evidence supporting Apple\u2019s claim that the changes it made to the App Store would lower prices for app users.\nEven said in addition to Apple\u2019s fees, app developers face costs related to alternative payment solutions. But Apple did no analysis into the latter bucket of costs and still said that its App Store changes would translate to lower prices for users, the lawyer argued.\nThe judge seemed to agree.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for data and it sounds like you all made lots of decisions without data,\u201d she said.\nThe hearing will continue next week.\nThe case is Epic Games Inc. v.

Most People Don\u2019t Realize They Should Do This One Thing\nApple\u2019s recent foray into AI-driven advertising and its solid position within the tech industry have kept investor interest high. Even amidst challenges, notable figures like Jim Cramer have advised investors to have \u201cpatience, patience, patience,\u201d recognizing Apple\u2019s resilience and potential for long-term gains.\nFor those looking to generate a steady stream of income from Apple stocks, dividends offer an appealing avenue. Currently boasting a dividend yield of 0.55%, Apple distributes a quarterly dividend of 24 cents per share, totaling 96 cents annually.\nTo achieve a monthly income of $500 from Apple dividends, investors need to strategize their investment accordingly. With a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months), simple arithmetic reveals the necessary investment: $6,000 divided by $0.96 yields approximately 6,250 shares of Apple stock. This translates to an investment of around $1,082,688.\nFor those seeking a more modest goal, say $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), the calculation remains the same: $1,200 divided by $0.96 equates to roughly 1,250 shares of Apple stock. This corresponds to an investment of about $216,538.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the dividend yield is not a fixed metric; it fluctuates based on both the dividend payment and the stock price. As stock prices rise or fall, the dividend yield adjusts accordingly.\nMoreover, changes in the dividend payment itself also influence the dividend yield. A company increasing its dividend payment would lead to a higher yield, even if the stock price remains constant. Conversely, a decrease in dividend payment would result in a lower yield.\nDespite these fluctuations, Apple\u2019s consistent performance and commitment to shareholder value make it an attractive choice for dividend investors.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA.

Rather, Apple has preferred to be a thoughtful late adopter, unbowed to trends.\nComputers, MP3 players, phones, tablets, headphones, VR headsets. Most were successes for Apple; all were \u201clate\u201d relative to the competition.\nUnlike the brute power of investment its peers are pouring into AI, Apple\u2019s services business relies on the company\u2019s shiny brand and walled-garden ecosystem.\nWe\u2019d expect Apple\u2019s pending AI strategy to capitalize on this approach, continue fostering the company\u2019s margin boom that has defined its last few years of corporate life, and set the company apart from its peers.\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +13.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 12.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.2%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.20 indicates a change of +9.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $83.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.7%. The $384.62 billion and $405.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.4% and +5.5%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nApple reported revenues of $90.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.85%. The EPS surprise was +1.32%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple.

Today, at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET, the company is set to unveil the latest additions to the iPad line. According to the rumor mill, that list includes: a new iPad Pro, iPad Air, Apple Pencil and a keyboard case.\nMore surprisingly, the event may also see the launch of the new M4 chip, a little over six months after the company unveiled three new M3 chips in one fell swoop. Why the quick silicon refresh? Well, for starters, word on the street is that Apple launched the M3 later than expected (likely owing to supply chain issues), forcing the company to launch all three chips at the same event.\nImage Credits: Apple\nCouple that with the fact that Microsoft is rumored to be launching its own third-party silicon at Build at the end of May, and you start to understand why the company opted not to wait. An announcement may be even more pressing, given that the Microsoft/ARM chips are said to offer \u201cindustry-leading performance\" -- an apparent shot across Apple's bow. Could a new chip also mean new Macs? That would be a short refresh cycle for the current crop, but it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.\nWhat does seem certain, however, is a new iPad Pro with an OLED display, a 12.9-inch iPad Air and new gestures for the Apple Pencil.

That change required a revamp of Siri\u2019s underlying software using large language models \u2014 a core technology behind generative AI \u2014 and will be one of the highlights of Apple\u2019s renewed push into AI, they said.\nThe upgrade is one piece of the company\u2019s larger AI strategy, which will be unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. Apple is preparing several features, including voice memo transcriptions and summaries, quick recaps of websites and notifications, automated message replies, advanced photo editing, and AI-generated emojis, Bloomberg has reported.\nAs part of the rollout, more basic AI tasks will be processed on devices themselves, while more advanced capabilities will be handled via cloud computing. The company also has been forging a deal with OpenAI to integrate the startup\u2019s chatbot and other technology into the iOS operating system, and it remains in talks with Google parent Alphabet Inc. to use its Gemini software in the future. Apple software boss Craig Federighi has told his teams to develop as many new AI features as possible for this year\u2019s operating system updates.\nSiri will be a key focus of the WWDC unveiling.

That includes being able to open individual documents, moving a note to another folder, sending or deleting an email, opening a particular publication in Apple News, emailing a web link, or even asking the device for a summary of an article.\nA representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\nToday, Siri is limited mostly to broader commands like playing music playlists, looking up information or controlling smart home appliances. The company also offers what are known as app intents to developers, allowing them to craft ways for Siri to tap individual features. In 2018, Apple launched Siri Shortcuts as well, letting users manually create commands for app features.\nThe new system will go further, using AI to analyze what people are doing on their devices and automatically enable Siri-controlled features. It will be limited to Apple\u2019s own apps at the beginning, with the company planning to support hundreds of different commands.\nRead More: Apple Needs to Evolve to Compete in the Artificial Intelligence Era\nThe feature is one of Apple\u2019s more complex AI initiatives and isn\u2019t planned for release until as soon as next year, when it will be part of a subsequent update to iOS 18, according to the people. The first version of the new operating system will launch in September, around the same time as the next iPhone models.\nAt the start, the new Siri will handle one command at a time, but Apple has plans to to allow users to chain commands together. For example, they could ask Siri to summarize a recorded meeting and then text it to a colleague in one request. Or an iPhone could theoretically be asked to crop a picture and then email it to a friend.\nA major component of the new push is a system that will use AI to automatically determine if a function should be handled on the device or via the cloud.\nThat has raised some privacy questions. While on-device tasks won\u2019t share personal information, the cloud-based approach will require some user data to be transferred to remote servers. The information will be protected by the so-called Secure Enclave in the high-end Apple Mac chips powering the data centers, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.\nRead More: Apple to Power AI Tools With In-House Server Chips This Year\nApple will attempt to further reassure customers that their data is private by creating an \u201cintelligence report\u201d that explains how the information is secured. The iPhone maker also won\u2019t build profiles of customers \u2014 something it\u2019s criticized Google and Meta Platforms Inc. for doing.\nWith the Siri upgrade, Apple is looking to reinvigorate a pioneering product that fell behind competitors\u2019 services. The company first launched Siri in 2011, giving it a head start in voice-based interfaces and AI. But Apple soon lost that lead to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Alexa and the Google Assistant. Then it was caught flat-footed again when generative AI chatbots emerged two years ago.\nApple also is contending with a sales slowdown, and its shares have underperformed those of peers this year. The stock is down about 1% in 2024, compared with a 10% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index. Apple was up 0.5% to $191.29 in New York on Thursday.\nApple is betting that the new AI features for the iPhone, iPad and Mac \u2014 as well as the Siri enhancements \u2014 will encourage users to upgrade their devices. Many of the on-device AI capabilities will require an iPhone 15 Pro or later to work. Macs and iPads, meanwhile, will need at least an M1 chip.\n(Updates with shares in second-to-last paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "Title": "Is Jim Cramer Right About This Apple Catalyst?",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a mammoth valuation near $3 trillion. It's one of the most valuable companies in the world, trailing only rival Microsoft in market cap. But many analysts and investors remain optimistic that the business can become even more valuable in the future.\nOne of them is CNBC's Jim Cramer. What might surprise you, however, is the reason for his optimism. It's not due to a new iPhone coming out or the company's plans to launch a chatbot, or even the strength of its services business. It involves an area of Apple's business that remains unproven.\nApple's Vision Pro virtual reality headsets became available for U.S. consumers earlier this year. But with a price tag that starts at $3,499, it's steep even for Apple customers who are used to paying top dollar for its devices.\nCramer, however, believes it's a huge opportunity for the business, one that could be an enormous moneymaker for Apple in the years ahead.\nThe problem is that he believes the headset should be targeted to businesses. Using digital twins, the device could help in industrial settings to reduce waste and test out changes before actually deploying them at factories. It could promote sales by allowing business customers to view large items (e.g., cars) before placing orders for them, avoiding on-site visits and costly travel.\nWith so much potential for the headsets, Cramer believes that they could be considered cheap for enterprise customers.\nThe demand for headsets isn't strong, at least not yet. Apple has reportedly slashed its forecast for the Vision Pro headsets drastically, according to an analyst who covers the company. From an estimate of 700,000 to 800,000 units sold this year, Apple is now expecting a far lower range, between 400,000 and 450,000 units.\nBy comparison, rival Meta Platforms has sold tens of millions of its Quest headsets, but it has had to reduce prices along the way. These days, consumers can buy a Quest headset for just a few hundred dollars. It might be a hard sell, even for businesses, to justify paying a significant premium for Vision Pro headsets even if they do think they are superior.\nAnd while there is a potential market for business buyers, I think Cramer is overplaying it. Companies don't need high-priced headsets to review large purchases or to do what-if scenarios.\nPlus, adoption of the headsets would change business processes, requiring user training, and additional software could be needed to integrate them with a company's existing systems. It likely wouldn't be as simple as just strapping on a headset and continuing with regular workflows. There are extra costs and resource constraints to consider.\nApple's Vision Pro headsets certainly have the potential to be an exciting new product for the tech company, but even if they are successful, the headsets might not make a big difference in the company's earnings.\nApple has generated a mammoth $382 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months. For the Vision Pro to account for even 1% of the top line, the company would need to sell more than 1 million of them per year at their current price tag. That could be a tall task, especially when Meta's devices might offer a much cheaper alternative for prospective buyers.\nThere are a lot of reasons to like Apple. It has a loyal following of customers, its services business continues to grow and generate record sales, and the company gushes cash and recently announced an incredible $110 billion stock buyback plan.\nThose are all reasons to remain bullish on the company. The Vision Pro could prove to be a good bet for Apple, but it's far too early to expect that to be a significant growth driver for the business in the long haul, and investors should be careful not to set their expectations too high.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will deliver some of its upcoming artificial intelligence features this year via data centers equipped with its own in-house processors, part of a sweeping effort to infuse its devices with AI capabilities.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind\nMacron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe\nBiden Adds Tariffs on Chinese Chips, Critical Minerals, EVs\nTesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk\u2019s Cuts\nFive Under-the-Radar Billionaires Making Vast Fortunes in Modi's India\nThe company is placing high-end chips \u2014 similar to ones it designed for the Mac \u2014 in cloud-computing servers designed to process the most advanced AI tasks coming to Apple devices, according to people familiar with the matter. Simpler AI-related features will be processed directly on iPhones, iPads and Macs, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan is still under wraps.\nThe move is part of Apple\u2019s much-anticipated push into generative artificial intelligence \u2014 the technology behind ChatGPT and other popular tools. The company is playing catch-up with Big Tech rivals in the area but is poised to lay out an ambitious AI strategy at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10.\nApple\u2019s plan to use its own chips and process AI tasks in the cloud was hatched about three years ago, but the company accelerated the timeline after the AI craze \u2014 fueled by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini \u2014 forced it to move more quickly.\nThe first AI server chips will be the M2 Ultra, which was launched last year as part of the Mac Pro and Mac Studio computers, though the company is already eyeing future versions based on the M4 chip.\nApple shares briefly reached a session high of $184.59 in New York trading after Bloomberg reported the details. The stock is down more than 4% for the year. A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\nRead More: Apple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot\nRelatively simple AI tasks \u2014 like providing users a summary of their missed iPhone notifications or incoming text messages \u2014 could be handled by the chips inside of Apple devices. More complicated jobs, such as generating images or summarizing lengthy news articles and creating long-form responses in emails, would likely require the cloud-based approach \u2014 as would an upgraded version of Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant.\nThe move, coming as part of Apple\u2019s iOS 18 rollout in the fall, represents a shift for the company. For years, Apple prioritized on-device processing, touting it as a better way to ensure security and privacy. But people involved in the creation of the Apple server project \u2014 code-named ACDC, or Apple Chips in Data Centers \u2014 say that components already inside of its processors can safeguard user privacy. The company uses an approach called Secure Enclave that can isolate data from a security breach.\nFor now, Apple is planning to use its own data centers to operate the cloud features, but it will eventually rely on outside facilities \u2014 as it does with iCloud and other services. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on some aspects of the server plan.\nNever miss an episode. Follow The Big Take daily podcast today.\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, hinted at the approach on an earnings call last week. \u201cWe have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties,\u201d he said after being asked about the company\u2019s AI infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s a model that has worked well for us historically, and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.\u201d\nRead More: Inside Apple\u2019s Big Plan to Bring Generative AI to All Its Devices\nHandling AI features on devices will still be a big part of Apple\u2019s AI strategy. But some of those capabilities will require its most recent chips, such as the A18 launched in last year\u2019s iPhone and the M4 chip that debuted in the iPad Pro earlier this week. Those processors include significant upgrades to the so-called neural engine, the part of the chip that handles AI tasks.\nApple is rapidly upgrading its product line with more powerful chips. In a first, it\u2019s bringing a next-generation processor \u2014 the M4 \u2014 to its entire range of Mac computers. The Mac mini, iMac and MacBook Pro will get the M4 later this year, and the chip will go into the MacBook Air, Mac Studio and Mac Pro next year, Bloomberg News reported in April.\nRead More: Apple Plans to Overhaul Entire Mac Line With AI-Focused M4 Chips\nTaken together, the plans lay the groundwork for Apple to weave AI into much of its product line. The company will focus on features that make life easier for users as they go about their day \u2014 say, by making suggestions and offering a customized experience. Apple isn\u2019t planning to roll out its own ChatGPT-style service, though it\u2019s been in discussions about offering that option through a partnership.\nJust last week, Apple said the ability to run AI on its devices will help it stand out from rivals.\n\u201cWe believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple\u2019s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the earnings call.\nWithout getting into specifics, Cook said that Apple\u2019s in-house semiconductors would give it in an edge in this still-nascent field. He added that the company\u2019s privacy focus \u201cunderpins everything we create.\u201d\nThe company has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the cloud-based initiative over the past three years, according to the people. But there are still gaps in its offerings. For users who want a chatbot, Apple has held discussions with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and OpenAI about integrating one into the iPhone and iPad.\nRead More: Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy D. Cook\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin America and the Middle East as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential.In Services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. We estimate this onetime impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we removed this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described.Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro, and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They described the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes, and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room.It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market. For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before. And this is just the beginning.Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in store.We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration, groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry-leading neural engines, and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do.Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets including Mainland China, and according to Kantar, during the quarter, the 2 bestselling smartphones in urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max.I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future.Turning to Mac. March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and its even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it.In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet.Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10 and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our Watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine learning to power life-saving features like irregular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones, and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need.As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in Services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins.Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail. Our stores continue to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time.Everywhere we operate, in everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and leave the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple Podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing. Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period. And we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before.Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with the new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most, with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next 2 decades.Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects. And last month, we welcomed 2 supplier partners as new investors who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives.With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments.Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to Services partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record. And operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion.Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this onetime impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S.Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Also, customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S.iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high, as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest report from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the U.S.Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers with almost 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high. And customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S.In Services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continue to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem.Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only 4 years ago. We continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay.Turning to enterprise. Our customers continue to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the MAC. In health care, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for health care organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use.And since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing a Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the special computing opportunity in enterprise.Taking a quick step back. When we look at our performance during the first half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets. As we said, first half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in Services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year.Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt, and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open market repurchases of 130 million Apple shares.Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024, to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024.As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low single digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our Services business to grow double digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first half of the fiscal year. And we expect iPad revenue to grow double digits.We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nThank you, Luca. (Operator Instructions) Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator\nWe will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Ng\nI have 2. First, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance, the revenue outlook for low single digits growth. I was wondering if you could run through some of the product assumptions. iPhone, like what kind of gives you confidence around that? And then on the Services momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter? And then I just have a quick follow-up.\nLuca Maestri\nMike, it's Luca. On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low single digits in total for the company. We expect Services to grow double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first half of our fiscal year. And we also mentioned that iPad should grow double digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter.In Services, we've seen very strong performance across the board. We've mentioned we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad-based. Our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing. Paid accounts are growing double digits. And also, we've seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets, so very pleased with the way the Services business is going.\nMichael Ng\nGreat. And I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that we've seen in the last few years of about $10 billion to $11 billion per year? Or any changes to how we may have historically thought about the split between tooling, data center, and facilities?\nLuca Maestri\nYes. We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with GenAI. We obviously are pushing very hard on innovation on every front, and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last 5 years, we spent more than $100 billion in research and development.As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners. On the manufacturing side, we purchase some of the tools and manufacturing equipment. In some of the cases, our suppliers make the investment.And we do something similar on the data center side. We have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically, and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan\nTim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA? You've had to open up third-party app stores. Clearly, this poses some security risks on the one hand, which can dilute the experience but also lower payments from developers to Apple. What are you seeing developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores? And I have a follow-up.\nTimothy D. Cook\nIt's really too early to answer the question. We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate billing, et cetera. So we're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned. And so that's our focus.\nWamsi Mohan\nOkay. And Luca, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step down. You noted mix and leverage. Any more color on the mix, if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines? Or is this more a mix across product lines? Just trying to get some color on customer behavior given some of the broader inflationary pressures.\nLuca Maestri\nOn a sequential basis, yes, we were down. It's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one. Obviously, leverage plays a big role as we move from the holiday quarter into the -- into a more typical quarter. So I would say, primarily leverage and a different mix of products. I mean we haven't seen anything different in terms -- within the product categories, we haven't seen anything particular.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik William Richard Woodring\nMaybe my first one, Tim, you've obviously mentioned your excitement around generative AI multiple times. I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because, historically, software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles. And so could AI be potentially different? How could that impact replacement cycles? Is there any services angle you'd be thinking? Any early color that you can share on that? And then I have a follow-up, please.\nTimothy D. Cook\nI don't want to get in front of our announcements obviously. I would just say that we see generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products, and we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there. And we'll be talking more about it in -- as we go through the weeks ahead.\nErik William Richard Woodring\nOkay. Very fair. And then, Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsi's comments or question, there's a broad concern about the headwind that rising commodity costs have on your product gross margins. Wondering if you could just clarify for us, if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products kind of collectively, are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help mitigate some rising costs if at all -- rising input costs if at all?\nLuca Maestri\nYes. I mean, during the last quarter, commodity costs and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the March quarter. But in general, I think it's been a period, not only this quarter but the last several quarters, where commodities have behaved well for us.Commodities go in cycles, and so there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. And so we're starting from a good point. As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. So we would try to mitigate if there are headwinds, but in general, we feel, particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius.\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nTim, I was wondering if I could ask the China question again. Is there any more color from your visit there that gives you confidence that you've reached the bottom there and that it's turning? I know you've been -- you've continued to be confident there in the long term. Just wondering if there was any color as to when you think the tide turns there. And I have a follow-up.\nTimothy D. Cook\nBen, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8. That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. And the primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone. And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier.And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the top 2 in urban China are iPhones. And while I was there, it was a great visit, and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic. And so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. And so I maintain a great view of China in the long term. I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week, but over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\nOkay. And then my follow-up, I want to ask this carefully, though. It's -- there's a fear out there that you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue. And I was wondering if you thought AI, from a big picture -- and it doesn't have to be on a long-term basis, I mean, from a big picture, if AI is an opportunity for you to continue to monetize your mobile real estate, just how you -- how maybe investors can think about that from a big picture just given that's been one of the concerns. That's potentially been an overhang, of course, due to a lot of the news in the media around some of the legal cases. And I was wondering if there's just a big picture color you could give that makes us kind of think about it better and your ability to sort of continue to monetize that real estate.\nTimothy D. Cook\nI think AI, generative AI and AI both are big opportunities for us across our products. And we'll talk more about it in the coming weeks. But I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us, and we think that we're well positioned.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar\nAgain, sorry to beat the AI horse, but Tim, I know you don't want to like reveal a lot. But I'm just kind of curious because last quarter, you spoke about how you're getting traction in enterprise. Is the AI strategy going to be both consumer and enterprise? Or is it going to be 1/2 or the other? Any color would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up for Luca.\nTimothy D. Cook\nOur focus on enterprise has been in, through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it, on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs. And we recently added Vision Pro to that, and we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. And so I see enormous opportunity in the enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in enterprise.\nKrish Sankar\nGot it. Very helpful. And then for Luca, I'm kind of curious on -- given the macro environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards like standard iPhone versus the Pro model? The reason I'm asking the question is that there's a weaker consumer spending environment, yet your Services business is still growing and has amazing growth margins. So I'm just trying to like square the circle over there.\nLuca Maestri\nI'm not sure I fully understand the question. But in general, what we are seeing on the product side, we continue to see a lot of interest at the top of the range of our products. And I think it's a combination of consumers wanting to purchase the best product that we offer in the different categories and our ability to make those purchases more affordable over time.We've introduced several financing solutions from installment plans to trade-in programs that reduce the affordability threshold and therefore, customers tend to buy -- want to buy at the top of the range. That is very valuable for us in developed markets but particularly in emerging markets where the affordability issues are more pronounced. But in general, over the last several years -- and that is also reflected in our gross margins. Over the last several years, we've seen this trend, which we think is pretty sustainable.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\nI have 2 as well. I guess first off on capital allocation. You folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you think about eventually getting to this net cash neutral target, do you think, at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program? Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? I'm just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time? And what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?\nLuca Maestri\nAmit, this is Luca. I would say one step at a time. We have put out this target of getting to net cash neutral several years ago, and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly the last few years. And so as you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback.For the last couple of years, we were doing $90 billion. Now we're doing $110 billion. So let's get there first. It's going to take a while still. And then when we are there, we're going to reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time. Obviously, there's going to be a number of considerations that we will need to look at when we get there.\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\nFair enough. I figured it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to this China discussion a bit, and Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in Mainland China is really notable. Could you step back? I mean these numbers are still declining, at least Greater China, on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China. And then at least the annual decline -- or year-over-year decline that we're seeing, do you think it's more macro driven or more competitive driven over there? That would be helpful.\nTimothy D. Cook\nYes, I can only tell you what we're seeing. And so I don't want to present myself as an economist, so I'll steer clear of that. From -- what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone, and iPhone in Mainland China, before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier, did grow. That means the other products didn't fare as well, and so we clearly have work there to do.I think it has been and is, through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world. And I -- so I wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before and I believe that it was last quarter as well. And -- but if you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class. We try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers. And you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. And so I continue to feel very optimistic.\nOperator\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt\nI'm going to roll the 2 together, so you guys have them both. So Luca, obviously, I'm trying to parse through the outlook for the June quarter. And just based on the quick math, it looks like, all things being equal given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down mid-single digits again in the June quarter. And if that's the case, and maybe this is for Tim, obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said maybe outside of China?And what changes sort of the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices because we've been in this malaise for a while? Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward? Or is it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point maybe later this year into next year?\nTimothy D. Cook\nI do see a key opportunity, as I'd mentioned before, with generative AI, with all of our devices or the vast majority of our devices. And so I think that if you look out, that's not within the next quarter or so, and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic. And so that's kind of how I view it. In terms of -- I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it. I think if you step back on iPhone, though, and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flattish on iPhone. And so that's how we performed in Q2.\nLuca Maestri\nYes, David, on the outlook, I'll only repeat what we said before, and this is the color that we're providing for the quarter. We do expect to grow in total low single digits. We do expect services to grow double digits, and we expect iPad to grow double digits. For the rest, I'll let you make assumptions, and then we will report 3 months from now.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee\nI have a couple as well. Maybe for the first one, your Services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%. If you can sort of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration and why is it a bit more sustainable as we think about the next quarter? Because I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter. So just curious what were the drivers. And why not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year? I have a quick follow-up.\nLuca Maestri\nSo a number of things on Services. First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, so we see our Services do well across the world. Records in many of our Services categories, there are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our Services business like cloud, video, payment services. Those all set all-time revenue records. So we feel very good about the progress that we're making in Services. As we go forward, I'll just point out that if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. So the comps for the Services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year. But in general, as I mentioned, we still expect to grow double digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half.\nSamik Chatterjee\nGot it. Got it. And for my follow-up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market. Obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in that market. How much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with your sort of retail strategy in that market, retail expansion relative to maybe some of the supply change or the manufacturing changes or strategy you've undergone or taken in that market itself? Any thoughts around that would be helpful.\nTimothy D. Cook\nSure. We did grow strong double digit, and so we were very, very pleased with that. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there.From a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. And so yes, there -- the 2 things are linked from that point of view. But we have both operational things going on, and we have go to market and initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores as -- last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we've been very pleased that there's a rapidly growing base of developers there. And so we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nAnd I think I have 2 as well like everybody else. I guess I'm going to go back to the China question. I guess at a high level, the simple question is when we look at the data points that have been repeatedly reported throughout the course of this quarter, I'm curious, Tim, what are we missing? Like where do you think people are missing Apple's iPhone traction within the China market just at a high level given the data points that were reported throughout this course of last quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook\nI can't address the data points. I could only address what our results are. And we did accelerate last quarter and the iPhone grew in Mainland China. So that's what the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.\nAaron Christopher Rakers\nOkay. And then as a quick follow-up. I know you guys haven't talked about this, quantified it in quite some time, but I'm curious to how we would characterize the channel inventory dynamics for iPhone.\nTimothy D. Cook\nSure. The -- for the March quarter, we decreased channel inventory during the quarter. We usually decrease channel inventory during the Q2 time frame, so that's not unusual. And we're very comfortable with the overall channel inventory.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.\nRichard Alan Kramer\nI'm not going to ask about China, but you regularly call out all the rapid growth in many other emerging markets. So is Apple approaching a point where all those other emerging markets in aggregate might cross over to become larger than your current $70 billion Greater China segments? And maybe investors could look at that for driving growth for the wider business. And I have a follow-up for Luca.\nLuca Maestri\nI think, Richard, you're asking a really interesting question. We were looking at something similar recently. Obviously, China is by far the largest emerging market that we have. But when we start looking at places like India, like Saudi, like Mexico, Turkey, of course, Brazil and Mexico and Indonesia, the numbers are getting large and we're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low. The populations are large and growing, and our products are really making a lot of progress with -- in those markets.The level of excitement for the brand is very high. Tim was in Southeast Asia recently, and the level of excitement is incredibly high. So it is very good for us. And then -- and certainly, the numbers are getting larger all the time, and so the gap, as you compare it to the numbers in China, is reducing. And hopefully, that trajectory continues for a long time.\nRichard Alan Kramer\nOkay. And then as a follow-up maybe for either of you, I mean, you're coming up on 4 years from what was an incredibly popular iPhone 12 cycle. And given you're struggling to reduce your net -- your -- reach your net neutral cash position and your margins are sort of near highs, do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand in your installed base, either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, more promotions? I mean do you feel like you need to produce those sort of margins? Or is it more important to spur growth with replacement?\nTimothy D. Cook\nI think innovation spurs the upgrade cycle and as one thing, of course, there's economic factors as well that play in there and what kind of offerings there are from our carrier partners and so forth. And so there's a number of variables in there. But we work all of those, and we price our products for the value that we're delivering. And so that's how we look at it.\nLuca Maestri\nAnd if I can add to Tim's comments, Richard, one of the things that when you look over the long arc of time that maybe is not fully understood is that we've gone through a long period of very strong dollar. And what that means, given that our company sells more than 60% of our revenues outside the United States, the demand for our products in those markets is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of those local currencies into dollars, right?And so that is something to keep in mind as you look at our results, right? And so we are making all the investments that are needed, and Tim has talked about innovation. Obviously, we made a lot of progress with financing solutions, with trading programs and so on, and we will continue to make all those investments.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik\nI have 2 questions as well. First, for Tim, for enterprise specifically, what are some of the top 2 or 3 use cases on Vision Pro you're hearing most excitement? And then I have a follow-up for Luca.\nTimothy D. Cook\nYes, the great thing is I'm hearing about so many of them. I wouldn't say that one has emerged as the top right now. The most impressive thing is that similar to the way people use a Mac, you use it for everything. People are using it for many different things in enterprise, and that varies from field service to training to health-care-related things like preparing a doctor for pre-op surgery or advanced imaging. And so it -- commands control centers. And so it's an enormous number of different verticals. And our focus is on -- is growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more and more enterprises engaged. And the event that we had recently, I can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room. It was extraordinary. And so we're off to a good start, I think, with enterprise.\nAtif Malik\nGreat. And then, Luca, I believe you mentioned that for the March quarter, the commodity pricing environment was favorable. Can you talk about what you're assuming for commodity pricing on memory, et cetera, for the June quarter and maybe for the full year?\nLuca Maestri\nYes. We provide guidance just for the current quarter, so I'll tell you about the guidance. We're guiding to -- again, to a very high level of gross margins, 45.5% to 46.5%. Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one but a slight headwind. And the same applies for foreign exchange. Foreign exchange will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points.\nSuhasini Chandramouli\nA replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

        "Title": "Buffett Praises Apple After Trimming It, Drops Paramount Stake",
        "Author": "  Amanda Albright and Isis Almeida ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- At Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday, Warren Buffett heaped praise on Apple Inc. \u2014 after revealing he\u2019d cut his stake in it.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial\nAmericans Are Racking Up \u2018Phantom Debt\u2019 That Wall Street Can\u2019t Track\nOne Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire\nFTX Has Billions More Than Needed to Pay Bankruptcy Victims\nBerkshire reported a $135.4 billion holding in the iPhone maker at the end of the first quarter, down from $174.3 billion at the year end. The move quickly became one of the biggest topics as the meeting unfolded, even though Berkshire had sold some shares in Apple during the quarter before.\nDespite the sale, Apple is \u201ceven better\u201d than American Express and Coca-Cola, which are \u201cwonderful\u201d businesses Berkshire also owns, Buffett told the crowd of thousands in Omaha. Unless something changes dramatically, Apple will remain its largest investment, he said, hinting that tax implications had motivated the sale. The iPhone may be one of the greatest products of all time, Buffett added.\nApple has faced a slew of headwinds \u2014 a $2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project among them. Shares in the company are down about 5% this year.\nThe sale bolstered Berkshire\u2019s cash pile, which climbed to a record $189 billion at the end of March. Given current market conditions \u2014 where rate cuts are uncertain, inflation remains elevated and geopolitical risks abound \u2014 Buffett said he didn\u2019t mind amassing the cash and said it could reach $200 billion by the end of the quarter.\nThe cash hoard also benefited from higher interest rates, earning $1.9 billion of interest income compared to $1.1 billion during the same quarter a year prior.\nBerkshire\u2019s cash pile has grown amid a dearth of sizable deals. Buffett said on Saturday he\u2019s been unable to find recent acquisitions that would \u201cmove the needle\u201d for the firm. Investors took it as a sign of his view on the stock market, too.\n\u201cBuffett is hoarding cash and therefore is bearish on the stock market,\u201d said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management. \u201cHe is unlikely to apply those funds unless he has a chance to buy an entire company or there is a major market sell off of 30% or more.\u201d\nHere are some other key takeaways from Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting and earnings:\nEarnings Gain\nIn a sign the US economy remained robust at the beginning of the year, the conglomerate\u2019s collection of businesses - which include manufacturers, home builders, insurance companies and retailers \u2014 generated $11.2 billion of operating earnings, a 39% jump on the prior year.\nImproved results at its insurance businesses helped the increase, earning $2.6 billion versus $911 million in the same period last year. At its auto-insurer Geico, pre-tax profits more than doubled to $1.93 billion, reflecting higher average policy premiums and lower claims, Berkshire said in its earnings statement. The business swung to profitability last year following several quarters of consecutive losses.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still work to be done, but in the meantime, we are not going to shrink,\u201d Buffett said of Geico.\nBerkshire\u2019s railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3% decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to \u201cunfavorable changes in business mix\u201d as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues.\nClimate, Wildfires\nBerkshire\u2019s PacifiCorp recorded $2.4 billion of estimated pre-tax probable losses from wildfires that spread across Oregon and California. About $1.7 billion of that remains unpaid, Berkshire said in its earnings report.\nPacifiCorp faces liability claims from the blazes, and damages sought by plaintiffs in Oregon and California totaled approximately $7 billion at the end of the first quarter, Berkshire said. At its annual meeting, Greg Abel \u2014 Buffett\u2019s appointed successor and vice chairman of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance operations \u2014 pointed to an additional claim for $30 billion that was filed last week, though he described it as \u201can incremental claim\u201d to an existing lawsuit.\nThe absence of Charlie Munger, Buffett\u2019s long-time business partner who died in November age 99, cast a pall over the meeting, which kicked off with a tribute film featuring a highlight reel of Munger\u2019s famously acerbic one-liners.\nBuffett said the two had a \u201clot of fun doing anything\u201d \u2014 he referenced golf and tennis \u2014 but they had even more fun \u201cwith things that failed, because then we really had to work, and work our way out of them.\u201d\nAt one point, Buffett mistakenly called Abel \u201cCharlie\u201d when he turned to him, and answered a question from a young attendee about what he\u2019d do if he had another day with to spend with Munger. Buffett answered that he would have spent it the same way as other days.\n\u201cHe went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99, but the world was interested in him,\u201d Buffett said of Munger.\nSuccession\nBuffett referenced his own mortality throughout the day, as the question of succession arose repeatedly. The billionaire investor assured Berkshire\u2019s shareholders that the company\u2019s future was in good hands. Abel \u2014 who understands businesses \u201cextremely well\u201d\u2014 should take over Buffett\u2019s capital allocation when he is no longer around, he said.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\u201d Buffett said, referring also to Ajit Jain, Berkshire\u2019s vice chair of insurance operations. \u201cIt has worked out extremely well.\u201d\nBuffett also kept invoking leadership changes at Apple, noting the strong leadership of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who took over for Steve Jobs.\n\u201cBuffett made it very clear that the structure of the firm is in place,\u201d said J. Dennis Jean-Jacques, founder and chief investment officer at Ocean Park Investments who first attended the meeting in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s going to become more important for shareholders to ensure the board of directors and managers keep the structure in tact \u2014 they are smart people and are not afraid to write to the CEO to let them know things are going wayward.\u201d\nParamount Global\nBerkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment. The company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is currently the subject of takeover talks.\n\u201cI did it all by myself, folks,\u201d Buffett said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home\nTesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger\nThe Company Preaching America\u2019s Nuclear Revival\nBoom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That\u2019s a Good Thing\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company\u2019s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro\u2019s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor.\nBut Apple focused most on the M4\u2019s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company\u2019s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today\u2019s AI PCs.\nThat might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we\u2019re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun.\nThe AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, and Google\u2019s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones.\nAI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple\u2019s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel\u2019s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips.\nAll of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It\u2019s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years.\nApple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine\u2019s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics.\nDuring its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks.\nQualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD\u2019s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively.\nYou can\u2019t mention AI performance without talking about Nvidia, but it\u2019s almost unfair to compare its chips to the competition. That\u2019s because Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips are dedicated to graphics processing and can be programmed to run AI apps. But because they\u2019re not multipurpose chips like those from Apple, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, they\u2019re far more capable. In fact, Nvidia claims its laptop chips offer 20x to 60x the performance of competing neural processing units.\nThe point is, there\u2019s a new stat for these tech companies to battle over, and you can be sure they\u2019ll do just that. The fact that Apple had already come out swinging with its own measurement is proof enough of that.\nWhat does that mean for the average consumer? Not all that much just yet. Generative AI apps running on PCs and Macs and iPads are still few and far between. So far, there are programs that help you manipulate photos and videos or track your eye movement in video chat apps.\nBut there\u2019s still no killer app that would get me to go running out the door to pick up an AI PC. That could all change in the coming weeks, though. That\u2019s because Microsoft and Apple are set to kick off their annual developers conferences, where they\u2019re expected to debut a slew of AI apps and services, and at least some of those should run on their respective devices.\nHow much they manage to entice consumers to pony up for AI PCs and the like, however, will depend on whether they\u2019re truly useful or not.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The Justice Department and Google will offer closing arguments in the case Thursday and Friday, with a decision expected later this year.\nGoogle and Apple had hoped to shield the payment amount from public disclosure. At the trial last fall, Apple executives testified that Google paid \u201cbillions,\u201d without specifying a number. A Google witness later accidentally disclosed that Google pays 36% of the revenue it earns from search ads to Apple.\nCourt documents filed late Tuesday ahead of the closing arguments mark the first public confirmation of the figures by Apple\u2019s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue. Such numbers aren\u2019t disclosed by either company in their securities filings. The documents also revealed the importance of the payments to Apple\u2019s bottom line. For instance, in 2020, Google\u2019s payments to Apple constituted 17.5% of the iPhone maker\u2019s operating income.\nThe agreement with Apple is the most important of Google\u2019s default deals, since it sets the search engine for the most used smartphone in the US.\nApple first agreed to use Google in the Safari browser in 2002 for free. But the companies later decided to share revenue made from search advertising. By May 2021, that translated to Google paying Apple more than $1 billion a month for its default status, prosecutors said in the filing.\nMicrosoft Corp., which operates competing search engine Bing, has repeatedly tried to entice Apple away from its relationship with Google. The company offered to share 90% of its advertising revenue with Apple to make Bing the default in Safari, according to the court documents. Those figures also weren\u2019t previously disclosed.\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella testified at the trial last year that the company was willing to make a number of concessions, including hiding the Bing brand, to persuade Apple to make the switch, which he said would be \u201cgame changing.\u201d\n\u201cWhomever they choose, they king-make,\u201d Nadella said of Apple.\n\u2014With assistance from Davey Alba, Mark Gurman and Dina Bass.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\nAI Is Helping Automate One of the World\u2019s Most Gruesome Jobs\nElon Musk vs. Jeff Bezos Is America\u2019s New Moon Race\nChina Launches Rockets From Sea in Bid to Win the Space Race\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online.\nThe ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years \u2014 from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro.\n\u201cThe most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,\u201d a narrator says at the end of the commercial.\nApple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf \u2014 with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution didn't land.\n\u201cI had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,\u201d said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cI understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).\u201d\nThe ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines \u201creplaced\u201d by technological advances \u2014 particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others note.\nSeveral celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple\u2019s \u201cCrush!\u201d commercial on social media this week.\n\u201cThe destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\u201d actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad.\nSome found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today \u2014 particularly concerns about big tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial \u201ccrushes the arts.\"\nExperts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past \u2014 which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches.\n\u201cMy initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,\u201d Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, said.\nGraves pointed to Apple\u2019s famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, \u201cthis (new iPad) commercial says, \u2018No, we\u2019re going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.\u2019\"\nIn a statement shared with Ad Age on Thursday, Apple apologized for the ad. The outlet also reported that Apple no longer plans to run the spot on TV.\n\u201cCreativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it\u2019s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\u201d\nCupertino, California-based Apple unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display.\nApple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17% from last year during the January-March period. After its 2010 debut helped redefine the tablet market, the iPad has become a minor contributor to Apple\u2019s success. It currently accounts for just 6% of the company\u2019s sales.\n"

        "Title": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Before June 10?",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been all the rage since early last year, with many of the biggest companies in technology staking their claim. For example, a number of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been extremely forthcoming about their plans to profit from the windfall resulting from the rapid adoption of AI, and several of these same stocks have generated market-beating returns this year.\nOne member of the collective that's been curiously left out of the conversation is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker has historically kept its plans and product upgrades close to the vest, including its intentions regarding the deployment of generative AI. This, combined with lackluster iPhone sales, has plagued Apple's share price, which is essentially flat in 2024.\nApple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) is scheduled to kick off on June 10, and speculation is rampant that the company will finally lay out its generative AI strategy. That, in turn, could light a fire under Apple's stagnant share price and set the stage for future gains.\nWith the stage set, should investors buy Apple stock before its highly anticipated event? Let's examine the available evidence.\nApple hasn't had much to say about the topic of generative AI, at least until recently. After remaining largely silent on the topic for nearly a year, CEO Tim Cook has finally begun to shed some light on Apple's aspirations. Earlier this year, Cook said of the company's AI plans, \"We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\" When pressed for additional details, Cook responded, \"Our M.O. [modus operandi], if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work.\"\nCook opened up a little more during Apple's second-quarter earnings call. \"We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.\" Cook went on to highlight the company's \"seamless\" integration of hardware, software, services, and processors while never taking its eye off user privacy.\nHistorically speaking, Apple has announced some of its most groundbreaking product releases and updates during WWDC, so it stands to reason the company would reveal its generative AI objectives at the event.\nWall Street is buzzing about Apple's annual conference, which would mark the perfect venue to introduce developers to the company's AI functionality. This would give them time to create signature generative AI-powered apps before the release of the next iPhone.\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan suggests that the release of AI-enabled phones could spark a multiyear upgrade cycle that's a \"once in a decade type of event.\" He goes on to suggest that with more than 2.2 billion active devices, Apple could drive generative AI into the mainstream. These AI-fueled devices could vastly improve photography, health monitoring, security, and even battery life.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives is even more bullish, raising his price target on Apple stock to $275 while maintaining an outperform (buy) rating on the shares. That represents 45% upside compared to Tuesday's closing price. Ives posits that an \"AI-driven iPhone 16 supercycle [is] now on the horizon.\" The analyst goes on to say that generative AI will represent \"ample monetization opportunities\" for Cook and company. Ives also revealed that recent channel checks suggest the beginning of a long-awaited rebound in iPhone sales in China, one of Apple's biggest markets. Tepid sales in the region have weighed on the stock in recent quarters.\nIt's also worth noting that of the 38 analysts who offered an opinion on Apple stock in May, 84% rated it a buy or strong buy, and not a single one recommended selling. Since Wall Street rarely agrees on anything, it's noteworthy when there's such a solid consensus.\nFor day traders looking to make a quick buck, hopping into and out of stocks around major events in order to catch the rally before selling, Apple might not be the stock for you. Truth be told, we don't know exactly what Apple will announce at WWDC. Furthermore, even if the company does jump feet-first into generative AI, that doesn't mean its efforts will yield immediate results.\nHowever, for investors with an outlook of years rather than weeks or months, there's plenty to like about Apple. The company has a long track record of defying detractors while continuing to build an empire. Market historians will note that Apple has rarely been first to market with anything but frequently releases industry-leading products that stand the test of time. At the same time, services is Apple's fastest-growing segment, driven by its 2.2 billion active devices.\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I'm inclined to believe that Apple stock will perform much better in the second half of 2024 than the first half and will be a market-beating investment over the next five years. That said, if the company's WWDC announcement disappoints, it could be a rough ride over the short term.\nFinally, there's the matter of Apple's valuation. At 29 times trailing-12-month earnings, the stock is only slightly more expensive than the multiple of 27 for the S&P 500. Furthermore, over the past five years, Apple stock has soared 327% (as of this writing), more than three times the 88% gains produced by the broad index. This helps illustrate why Apple is deserving of a premium.\nFor investors looking beyond June, I believe Apple's long track record of success speaks volumes about the company and its future prospects. That's why investors should simply buy Apple for the long runway ahead.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The new tablets include more powerful versions of the $999 11-inch and $1,299 13-inch iPad Pro outfitted with Apple's M4 chip and more vibrant OLED displays, and an upgraded iPad Air, which gets a 13-inch screen option to go along with the existing 11-inch version.\nThe company also unveiled the latest version of its Apple Pencil stylus complete with a new haptic feedback feature and an updated Magic Keyboard case for the iPad Pro line.\nThe new iPad Pros come equipped with Apple's new Ultra Retina XDR displays, which use OLED technology to improve overall color quality. Apple says the screens, its most advanced yet, use two OLED panels to form what the company calls its Tandem OLED panel.\nOLED panels are known for their exceptional color quality, but they're also thinner than traditional LCD screens. That, Apple says, makes the 10.9-inch iPad Pro just 5.3mm thick and the 13-inch model just 5.1mm thick, making it the company's thinnest device ever.\nIn addition to their new screens, the iPads come with Apple's new M4 chip. The first device to get Apple's latest silicon, the chip makes the latest iPad Pro 4 times faster than the iPad Pro with Apple's M2 processor and 10 times faster than the original iPad Pro.\nThe M4 runs on Apple's second-generation 3-nanometer technology and features up to four performance cores for heavy-duty processing and six efficiency cores for less resource-intensive applications. The company says the M4 provides up to 50% faster CPU performance than the M2 in the iPad pro. On the graphics side of things, Apple says the M4 has a 10-core GPU and provides four times faster graphics performance than the M2.\nApple also hinted at its AI ambitions, saying that the M4's new 16-core neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any PC today. Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm are all putting neural processing units into their latest processors to power onboard AI applications. Apple, however, was quick to point out that it's been adding neural engines to its processors for years, implying that it has a significant lead in the space.\nThe iPad Air, Apple's mid-range tablet, now comes with a 13-inch screen option to go along with the standard 11-inch model. Apple says roughly half of iPad Pro consumers opt for the larger 13-inch iPad Pro, giving them a reason to go for the larger screen option.\nThe front camera is now in the center of the side bezel, so you can use it in landscape mode while making FaceTime calls, and sports spatial audio. The 13-inch model gets double the base of the 11-inch.\nBoth iPad Airs now come with Apple's M2 chip, making it 50% faster than the prior iPad Air with the M1 chip and 3x faster than the A14-equipped Air. The Air also works with Apple's Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil stylus. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the 13-inch version starts at $799.\nDuring Tuesday's event, Apple also unveiled its Apple Pencil Pro stylus. The accessory, priced at $129, now includes a haptic feedback feature that produces a slight vibration to let you know when you've successfully selected something on the screen. There's also a built-in gyroscope that lets you roll the Apple Pencil Pro to choose specific inputs in drawing and painting apps. Find My compatibility also means you can quickly locate your pencil if you misplace it.\nApple's latest iPads come as the product line is mired in a sales slump. In 2022, the company reported iPad revenue of $29.29 billion, down 8% from the $31.86 billion it brought in in 2021. Declines continued in 2023, though they were less severe, with sales falling 3% on the year.\nSales continued to falter in Q1 and Q2 this year, dropping 22% and 17%, respectively. Apple's latest tablets, however, should give the lineup a much-needed sales boost.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Apple's quarterly iPhone sales plunge 10%, but stock price surges on dividend, stock buyback news",
        "Author": "  MICHAEL LIEDTKE ",
        "Text": "Apple on Thursday disclosed its steepest quarterly decline in iPhone sales since the pandemic\u2019s outset, deepening a slump that\u2019s increasing the pressure on the trendsetting company to spruce up its products with more artificial intelligence.\nThe 10% drop in year-over-year iPhone sales for the January-March period is latest sign of weakness in a product that generates most of Apple\u2019s revenue. It marked the biggest drop in iPhone sales since July-September period in 2020, when production bottlenecks caused by factory closures during the pandemic resulted in a delayed release of that year's model.\nThe current iPhone downturn was the main reason Apple\u2019s revenue for the latest quarter decreased 4% from last year to $90.8 billion. It marked the fifth consecutive quarter that Apple\u2019s revenue dipped from the previous year. Apple\u2019s profit in the past quarter totaled $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, a 2% dip from last year.\nBut both Apple's revenue and earnings per share came in slightly above analysts projections, according to FactSet Research. Apple also predicted its revenue for the April-June quarter will rise modestly from a year ago, which would end the recent streak of erosion.\nPart of the iPhone deterioration during the first three months of the year stemmed from a big boost in sales during the same period last year when Apple said it was filling pent-up demand caused by pandemic-driven shipment delays.\nEven as it stumbles slightly, Apple remains one of the world\u2019s most prosperous companies. The Cupertino, California, company hammered home that point by announcing a 4% increase in its quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share. The company also committed to spending $110 billion buying back its own stock, a move that investors cheered but may fuel criticism that Apple is spending more money catering to Wall Street than creating more innovative products.\nBolstered by the increased dividend and stock repurchase commitment, Apple's shares rose nearly 7% in extended trading after the news came out. The stock price has fallen 10% so far this year, erasing about $300 billion in stockholder wealth.\nAlthough investors have been dismayed by the weakening iPhone sales, they are also concerned Apple may be losing its edge as other tech giants such as Microsoft and Google sprint out to the early lead in artificial intelligence technology that is expected to reshape the industry and technology.\nThe latest quarterly report \u201cleaves no margin for doubt about Apple\u2019s current state of affairs,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro. \u201cMore than ever in the past decade, the company needs new products and solutions.\u201d\nApple is widely expected to unveil more AI services in June during an annual conference showcasing the next version of its software for the iPhone and Mac computers.\n\u201cWe believe in the transformative power and promise of AI and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook assured analysts during a Thursday conference while promising more details will be announced soon.\nWeak sales in China were again a factor in the latest quarter, with revenue in that region falling 8% from last year to $16.37 billion as rival smartphone makers gained ground in one of the company\u2019s largest markets. Even so, analysts had been anticipating an even bigger sales decline in the results, providing investors with a measure of relief.\nApple had a few bright spots in the past quarter too, most notably in its service division, which saw its revenue rise 14% from the year before to $23.87 billion.\nThe division reaps a significant portion of its revenue from a lucrative deal that locks in Google as the search engine that automatically answers queries on the iPhone \u2014 an arrangement that is a focal point of an antitrust trial currently wrapping up with closing arguments in Washington this week.\nCommissions collected on digital transactions within iPhone apps are also a major revenue source within Apple\u2019s services division, an area being targeted in a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit alleging the company is running an illegal monopoly that locks out competition to the detriment of consumers.\nThat case is expected to take several years to resolve, but European regulators already are forcing Apple to allow more alternatives to its proprietary iPhone app store as part of the Digital Markets Act.\n"

        "Author": "  MICHAEL LIEDTKE ",
        "Text": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Longtime Apple executive Phil Schiller on Wednesday acknowledged a court-ordered makeover of the U.S. payment system in its iPhone app store hasn't done much to increase competition \u2014 a shortcoming that could result in a federal judge demanding more changes.\nSchiller, who has been overseeing the iPhone app store since its inception in 2008, made the admission during occasionally sheepish testimony about the new payment options that so far have been shunned by all but a few dozen apps since their introduction in January.\n\u201cWe have worked hard to create this program and I think we need to do a lot more to do to get developers,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cThere is work in front of us to make that happen.\u201d\nSchiller's appearance came two weeks into ongoing hearings being held in Oakland, California, federal court to determine whether Apple is properly adhering to an order issued as part of an antitrust case alleging its iPhone app store had turned into an illegal monopoly.\nAlthough U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected the monopoly claims made by Epic Games, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options.\nThat shake-up threatens to undercut Apple's own lucrative in-house payment system, which generates billions of dollars annually through commissions ranging from 15% to 30% of the purchase amount on digital transactions completed within iPhone apps.\nAfter more than two years of ultimately unsuccessful attempts to overturn the order to allow alternative payment links within apps, Apple in January complied with the requirement. As part of the change, Apple set up an application process to approve links to alternative payment systems and imposed fees of 12% to 27% when users clicked on those options.\nEpic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, asserted Apple's commissions for clicking on external payment links combined with other costs for payment processing effectively make the alternative more expensive than just paying Apple's fees for using its standard system.\nPrompted by Epic's objections, Gonzalez Rogers is now mulling whether to hold Apple in contempt of her order and taking more drastic actions aimed at giving consumers more payment choices in hopes of fostering competition that could lower prices.\nIn the five hearings held on the issue so far, Gonzalez Rogers has repeatedly sounded frustrated with Apple executives while occasionally asking questions suggesting she thinks the iPhone maker is mostly focusing on how to preserve its profit margins and corral most payments to its in-house system.\nAlthough the judge was relatively measured during Schiller's testimony, she was more blunt last week when was of his subordinates, Carson Oliver, was on the witness stand and she asked whether he understood the intent of her order.\n\u201cDid you understand the point was to increase competition?\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said. After Oliver confirmed he did, the judge muttered, \u201cDoesn't seem like it.\u201d\nDuring his Wednesday testimony, Schiller repeatedly defended Apple's response to the judge's order as well-intentioned to allow more competition while protecting the privacy and security of users.\nBut he had trouble explaining why the company is receiving so few applications to allow external payment links.\nIn the first four months, only 38 apps have sought approval for external payment links, and only 17 of those currently engaged in digital transactions, according to evidence submitted in the hearings. That is out of about 136,000 apps in the U.S. that have completed digital transactions in the U.S.\nSchiller said the facts emerging in the hearings \u2014 all of which he has attended \u2014 have prompted him to create \u201can action item\u201d to prod more iPhone apps to take advantage of external payment options.\nThe hearings are scheduled to resume May 31. Schiller will return to the witness stand to continue his testimony.\n"

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with COHU.\nOn May 2, 2024, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) disclosed its financial outcomes for the fiscal second quarter ending March 30, 2024, through an 8-K filing. The tech giant reported a quarterly revenue of $90.8 billion, marking a 4% decrease from the previous year, yet managed to exceed the earnings per share (EPS) expectations with a record $1.53 against analysts' estimates of $1.50.\nApple Inc, a cornerstone of the technology sector, is renowned for its innovative product lines including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, centered around a robust software ecosystem. With significant contributions to both hardware and software markets, Apple continues to expand its technological footprint with services like Apple Music, iCloud, and the newly introduced Apple Vision Pro.\nDespite the slight dip in total revenue, Apple achieved a new all-time high in its Services segment, which climbed to $23.867 billion from $20.907 billion in the previous year. This growth underscores Apple's successful diversification beyond hardware into more stable revenue streams. The quarter also saw the launch of Apple Vision Pro, highlighting Apple's push into spatial computing.\nCEO Tim Cook expressed enthusiasm about the company's trajectory and upcoming initiatives, including a significant product announcement and the Worldwide Developers Conference. CFO Luca Maestri pointed to robust customer loyalty and satisfaction as key drivers of the quarter's success, which also led to a new record in EPS for a March quarter.\nApple's commitment to returning value to shareholders remains steadfast, with the board authorizing an additional $110 billion for stock repurchases and a 4% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. These shareholder-friendly moves reflect confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects.\nThe condensed consolidated statements of operations reveal a mixed financial picture. While product sales saw a decline to $66.886 billion from $73.929 billion year-over-year, the increase in service revenue partially offset this drop. The total operating expenses were $14.371 billion, compared to $13.658 billion in the previous year, indicating increased investment in research and development as well as general administrative costs.\nApple's balance sheet remains robust with total assets of $337.411 billion and a significant liquidity position, evidenced by $32.695 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The firm's strategy of aggressive share repurchases and steady dividend payments also speaks to its strong cash flow management.\nWhile Apple faces challenges like global economic uncertainties and competitive pressures, its strategic focus on expanding its services business and innovation in high-growth areas like spatial computing positions it well for future growth. The company's ability to maintain high levels of profitability and shareholder returns, despite revenue fluctuations, provides a reassuring sign of its operational and financial resilience.\nIn conclusion, Apple's Q2 earnings report paints a picture of a company navigating market challenges with strategic clarity and financial prudence. As Apple continues to innovate and expand its services, it remains a critical watch for investors interested in technology and consumer electronics sectors.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Apple Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock popped in early trading on Friday, helping lift the entire market higher as well. The tech giant accounts for an outsized portion of the broader earnings of the S&P 500, making it among the most closely watched companies when earnings season rolls around. It also helps that the iPhone maker's market capitalization sits near $3 trillion.\nApple didn't disappoint investors with its late-Thursday earnings update. While sales declined, the slump was modest. And CEO Tim Cook and his team had some good news for investors to offset that sales weakness.\nRevenue landed at $91 billion, down from $95 billion a year ago. The iPhone business was the main reason for this drop, as consumers were cautious in their upgrade commitments following the launch of the iPhone 15. Apple collected $46 billion from iPhone sales this quarter, down from $51 billion a year ago.\nThere was plenty of good news for investors, though, both around Apple's finances and in its non-iPhone businesses. The company's cash flow generation remained high at $63 billion over the past six months. Profit margin is rising, too. And the company committed to a much higher level of cash returns. Apple raised its dividend by 4% while describing a massive new stock buyback program that was nearly double its previous target.\nApple's services segment is expanding, too, helping offset much of the weakness in the iPhone unit.\nInvestors won't have to wait long to receive further big updates from the tech stock leader. Apple is planning a new product announcement next week, executives said this week, and will likely detail its services growth plans during next month's developer's conference.\nStill, the short-term outlook is modest for Apple achieving growth this year, as demand is soft for consumer tech products in key markets like the U.S. and China. The company can help offset that weakness with more service sales, but a big growth acceleration will depend on Apple launching new products that resonate with its massive customer base.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

A strike in front of an Apple retail store would upset the finely tuned image of the company. It would also mark the first known walkout by unionized Apple retail workers in the US, but would follow one in France last year.\nThe union told employees it would provide $200 per week to the strikers after a walkout has gone on at least 14 days and that those who protest can\u2019t be fired for picketing over labor practices.\nApple, in a statement, said it \u201cdeeply\u201d values its retail team members \u201cand we\u2019re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits. As always, we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith.\u201d\nThe store and Apple have reached a series of agreements, none of which are considered to veer greatly from Apple\u2019s preexisting policies.

        "Text": "By David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Apple said on Tuesday it plans to ask a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and 15 states in March that alleged the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices.\nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Julien X. Neals in New Jersey, Apple said \"far from being a monopolist, Apple faces fierce competition from well-established rivals, and the complaint fails to allege that Apple has the ability to charge supra-competitive prices or restrict output in the alleged\nsmartphone markets.\"\nIn the letter to the judge, Apple said the DOJ relies on a new \"theory of antitrust liability that no court has recognized.\"\nThe government is expected to respond within seven days to the Apple letter, which the court requires parties to submit, hoping to expedite cases before advancing to a potentially more robust and expensive effort to dismiss a lawsuit.\nThe Justice Department alleges that Apple uses its market power to get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants. The civil lawsuit accuses Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.\nThe Justice Department, which did not immediately comment, has previously said Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and makes a larger profit than any rival. Officials also said Apple imposes hidden charges on various business partners - from software developers to credit card companies and even rivals such as Alphabet's Google, in ways that ultimately raise prices for consumers.\nApple rejected the government's contentions that the iPhone has kept consumers \"locked in\" to the devices. \"Someone unhappy with Apple\u2019s limitations has every incentive to switch to\ncompetitor platforms that ostensibly do not have those limitations,\" the letter said.\n\"Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in March. \"If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.\"\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in WashingtonEditing by Matthew Lewis and David Gregorio)\n"

        "Text": "There was a bit of a stir Saturday, May 4, when people looking at Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly report noted that the value of its Apple stock holdings was down 22%.\nDid that mean Warren Buffett was bailing on its biggest holding?\nNo, Buffett told shareholders attending the annual meeting of\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0 (BRK.A) \u00a0and\u00a0 (BRK.B) \u00a0in Omaha, Neb. on Saturday.\nBut the number is a bit misleading. Berkshire reportedly did sell about 115 million Apple shares, about 13% of its stake. Based on the stock price, Berkshire's Apple stake ended the first quarter with 790 million shares.\nThe transactions were likely spread out over the first quarter. Using Apple's March 31 closing price, Buffett sold about $20 billion worth of Apple shares.\nSo, why sell at all? Basically, for tax reasons, Buffett said.\nApple's shares had risen 48% in 2023.\nApple's shares, however, fell nearly 11% during the first quarter of 2024. They're up 7% since the end of March and 7.7% just since the end of April.\nBerkshire is up 11% this year but down 5% so far in the second quarter.\nRelated: Analysts weigh in on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway\nBerkshire Hathaway has been a shareholder of Apple since 2016 when the late Charlie Munger convinced Buffett it was a great stock to buy. Munger, Berkshire's long-time vice chairman, died in late 2023.\nThe investment has been fantastically successful, and Buffett still believes deeply in Apple.\nHe\u00a0predicted Apple stock will still be Berkshire's biggest holding at the end of the year. And, he noted, Apple CEO Tim Cook was attending the meeting.\nJOHANNES EISELE/Getty Images\nBuffett also suggested that share sales may be tied to his view that tax rates may possibly be going higher to fund a ballooning fiscal deficit in the U.S.\nPaying the taxes on selling Apple didn't bother Buffett \"in the least.\"\nMore Warren Buffett:\nAnalyst revamps Occidental Petroleum stock price target after oil rally\nWhy the S&P 500 is getting 2 new members this week\nMorningstar unveils 10 cheap stocks with wide moats\nAnd he added, \"I would really hope with all that America\u2019s done for all of you, it shouldn\u2019t bother you that we do it \u2014and if I\u2019m doing it at 21% this year and we\u2019re doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\u201d\nApple remains Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holding, representing about 40% of the conglomerate's stock portfolio, which had a total value of about $335.9 billion at the end of the quarter.\nAt the end of 2023, the portfolio was valued at $353.8 billion, with Apple representing about 49% of the portfolio's value.\nApple and stocks of four other companies represented about 75% of the portfolio's value at the end of March.

        "Text": "Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) have been nearly synonymous with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) since taking a position in the stock in 2014. The investment (and all the stock they bought along the way) turned out to be smart and made Berkshire a substantial profit.\nHowever, Berkshire has started to sell Apple stock despite voicing its belief in the business. At one point, Apple made up more than half of Berkshire's investment portfolio; now, it has retreated to less than 40%.\nSo why is Berkshire reducing its stake in one of Buffett's favorite companies? The answer may surprise you.\nBuffett is a value investor, but he's also one to hold on to a stock if it's winning. This is an excellent strategy, and it's one that many should emulate. However, there is one drawback: taxes.\nIf an investor has held a stock for more than a year, any profit they make is taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. For individual investors, this maxes out at 20%, depending on your income. For corporations, it's a flat 21%. This means that for every dollar in profit that Berkshire makes from Apple stock, $0.21 goes to the U.S. government.\nIn Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in 2024, Buffett mentioned that they don't mind paying taxes, but it sees the writing on the wall. Buffett mentioned that the rate was 35% not long ago and as high as 52% earlier in his career. After looking at the current political environment, he doesn't see those taxes decreasing, and most likely they will increase.\nIn the most recent State of the Union Address, President Joe Biden called for raising the corporate income tax rate to 28%, so Buffett's assessment seems valid.\nAs a result, Berkshire is taking action and capturing some of those gains before it's forced to pay higher taxes.\nDuring the meeting, Buffett reiterated a few times that Apple would remain its largest holding even if it continued to sell stock. However, I don't think selling Apple stock is a bad idea, especially after the quarter it just posted.\nApple's business is not what it once was. Consumers aren't upgrading their products as often, and Apple has struggled to launch a new hit product. The Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset, for example, isn't flying off the Apple Store shelves. iPhone sales are sliding, too. As a result, Apple's revenue fell from $94.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 to $90.8 billion (ending March 30) in FY 2024. This decline is just a continuation of a pattern that has been present since the start of 2023.\nDespite that, Apple has managed to improve its gross profit, which trickled down to the bottom line, and has kept earnings per share (EPS) flat compared to last year.\nIt's clear that Apple's core business (besides its services division) is struggling, but Apple's management is a world-class team, so the business' profits don't reflect these struggles.\nDespite that, Apple's stock still trades for a premium valuation: 28 times forward earnings.\nWith the S&P 500 index trading at a much less pricey 21 times forward earnings, it's clear the market still holds Apple in high esteem.\nI'm less convinced, and until Apple's core business starts improving, I don't want to be anywhere near the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The workers were let go for missing work, showing up late and failing to properly mark their attendance, Apple said. But the Communications Workers of America, or CWA, alleged in charges filed with the NLRB last year that the workers were actually fired for their unionization efforts.\nNLRB prosecutors originally dismissed the firing allegations last October, but the union filed an appeal in November. On Thursday, the NLRB rejected the appeal, telling the CWA \u201cthat the evidence was insufficient to show that the employer discharged the employees because of their protected activities rather than the legitimate business reasons relied on by the employer.\u201d\nStill, the general counsel\u2019s office determined that Apple did violate the law in other ways, including by coercing employees to waive their legal rights, threatening them with worse working conditions because they supported a union, and interrogating them about their labor activism, NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado said Friday.\nThe general counsel\u2019s office also found that Apple violated the law by holding mandatory \u201ccaptive audience\u201d anti-union meetings, Blado said in an email. Absent a settlement, the NLRB plans to issue a complaint against the company.\n\u201cWe strongly deny these claims and look forward to providing the full set of facts to the NLRB,\u201d Apple said in an emailed statement. Complaints issued by NLRB prosecutors are considered by agency judges, whose rulings can be appealed to labor board members in Washington and from there to federal appeals court. The agency lacks authority to make companies pay punitive damages for violations or hold executives personally responsible for violations.\nApple has clashed with union groups and the US labor board over the last two years as retail stores in the US push to unionize. So far, only two locations \u2014 Oklahoma City and Towson, Maryland \u2014 have successfully unionized. A store in Short Hills, New Jersey, is voting this weekend to determine if it should take that step.\nAlso this weekend, the Towson location will vote on whether to authorize a strike ahead of new bargaining talks with Apple. The two sides have reached a series of agreements, but none of the terms represent a big change from Apple\u2019s existing policies. The union told employees that there are ongoing negotiations regarding pay, overtime, unpaid leave of absences, time-away benefits and scheduling.\nEarlier this month, the US National Labor Relations Board ruled that Apple illegally interrogated staff at its World Trade Center store in New York City.\n(Updates with additional NLRB allegations fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits\nThe DNA Test Delusion\nUS East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia\u2019s Shifting Exports\nElon Musk\u2019s Big AI Contradiction\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works",
        "Author": "  Mark Hake, CFA ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a popular tech company that makes iPhones and Mac computers. Its growth rate is slowing as the company transitions from its past focus on mobile phones and computer products to online services, including cloud and artificial intelligence products.\nDespite slowing growth, Apple generates massive amounts of free cash flow, most of which is being used to buy back shares. This discussion will focus on why the stock looks cheap, given its use of FCF to make huge share repurchases.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with ITUB.\nI estimate the stock could be worth at least 17% more at over $222 per share based on its powerful free cash flow.\nFirst, let's look at its free cash flow generation, as Apple is a veritable cash cow.\nIn the first quarter, Apple's revenue fell 4.30% and its net income dropped 2.20%. But earnings per share rose 0.30% from $1.52 to $1.53. The reason is because the company reduced its share count by 2.42% on average, which was slightly more than the drop in net income.\nThat is one way Apple's huge buybacks have been helping the stock, despite its negative growth. In fact, on May 2, it announced a new $110 billion share purchase program. It can easily afford this, too. For example, in the trailing 12 months ending March 31, Apple generated $103.90 billion in free cash flow. Further, as will be shown below, the company is forecasted to generate around $111 billion in FCF by the end of the next fiscal year.\nFCF is the amount of cash flow left over after covering all cash expenses and net changes in working capital, as shown in the statement of cash flows (i.e., operating cash flow), less spending on capital expenditures.\nApple spent $81.80 billion on buybacks in the trailing 12-month period to March 31, or 78.70% of its FCF during that period.\nThis shows Apple can afford to do these massive buybacks. Next year, I project the tech giant could buy back $94 billion in shares if it raises its buybacks to 85% of FCF, up from 79% in the last 12 months.\nFor example, in the fourth quarter, Apple spent 112% of its FCF on share repurchases. That means it borrowed money or drew down its huge $67 billion cash and marketable securities balance to cover the excess FCF buyback spending.\nHere is how I came up with this FCF estimate. I took Apple's operating cash flow margin over the trailing 12-month period ending March and applied that margin to analysts' revenue estimates. Then I deducted capital expenditure spending, using its historical capex/revenue ratios.\nThis can be seen in the table below:\nThe table shows that over the trailing 12 months ending March 31, the company had a 29.2% operating cash flow margin.\nUsing analysts' revenue estimates for this year ending September 2024 and 2025 and deducing 2.30% of sales for capital expenditure spending, free cash flow could rise 2.70% to $104 billion this fiscal year and $110.80 billion next year ending September 2025.\nThe bottom line is that even with sales growing just 1% this year and 6.20% next year, Apple could still generate between $104 billion and $111 billion in free cash flow.\nThat will be more than enough to cover the new $110 billion buyback program, even if it takes more than one year to complete.\nBut what is driving this huge share repurchase program? Let's look at the potential effects.\nThe chart below shows Apple has reduced its share count between 2.40% and 3.20% on a rolling annualized basis each quarter for the past two and a half years.\nThe average year-over-year decline has been 2.53% in the trailing 12 months to March 31. The average decline in share count has been 2.75% annually for the past 24 months.\nSo going forward, we can expect its share count could fall at least 2.53% and possibly as much as 2.73% given the larger $110 billion buyback program.\nHere is how that would work out if compounded over five, 10 and 15 years.\nThis shows Apple's share count could fall between 28% and 31% over the next 10 years if the company averages between a 2.53% and 2.75% annual drop in shares due to buybacks.\nIn other words, given this would only happen if the company can generate higher amounts of free cash flow, the stock is likely to rise as a result.\nBased on a 3% FCF yield metric, it is likely that Apple's market value could be worth almost $3.60 trillion based on our FCF estimates. That is 23% higher than its present $2.91 trillion market cap.\nThis implies the stock could be worth 23% more or $233.79 per share.\nThis method assumes the market values its FCF at a yield of 3%. For example, in the last 12 months, the company has spent $81.80 billion on share repurchases and $15.10 billion on dividends, or $97 billion in total shareholder returns. That represents 3.30% of its present $2.90 trillion market capitalization.\nSo, just to be conservative, let's lower the valuation metric to a 3.33% FCF yield.\nThat lowers the price target to just 10.8% higher at $210.43 per share. However, the average of these two methods results in a market cap of $3.40 trillion. That means the average stock price target is 17% higher at $222.11 per share.\nKeep in mind this does not include the effects of the higher $110 billion share buyback program. That would likely boost the target price at least another 2.50% to 5% to potentially a 22% higher stock price. The bottom line is Apple looks undervalued here.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Sold Apple and Paramount. Here's What He's Buying Instead.",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett hasn't found a lot to like in the stock market recently.\nIn each of the last six quarters, Buffett has sold more stocks for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) than he bought. Last quarter, he sold off a big chunk of his Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) position and the entirety of his Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) investment. All told, he sold nearly $20 billion worth of stocks from Berkshire's portfolio, and he bought less than $3 billion.\nBuffett lamented investment opportunities for Berkshire are few and far between as the company grows bigger. With a market cap of about $877 billion, there are only so many investments that can move the needle for the conglomerate. So, when Buffett does add to an existing position or initiate a new one, investors should pay attention, as it could be a big opportunity for anyone following his lead.\nBuffett trimmed about 13% of his Apple position in the first quarter, leaving Berkshire with just under 800 million shares.\nApple remains Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity position by far, representing around 40% of the portfolio. And Buffett said it's \"extremely likely\" Apple will remain the largest holding in the portfolio at the end of the year. That's despite selling off shares in each of the last two quarters.\nSo, why did Buffett sell? In a word: taxes.\nBuffett thinks paying taxes now on the massive capital gain for Berkshire's Apple shares is a smart move.\n\"We are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking on Apple. And that rate was 35% not that long ago, and it's been 52% in the past,\" he told the audience in Omaha at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting. \"I would say with the present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give, and I think that higher taxes are quite likely.\"\nSo, Buffett is taking the tax hit now because he thinks there's a good chance the taxes will be higher in the future. \"If I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it at a higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he added.\nBuffett also sold shares of Apple in 2019 and 2020 for tax purposes. In 2021, he admitted that was probably a mistake. Still, with the massive run in Apple shares since then, Buffett thought it would be worth it to take the tax bill on the gains now. He could always add shares back to the position if the opportunity presents itself.\nWith regard to Paramount, Buffett admitted that he's learned a lot about how people value their leisure time and what a successful entertainment business looks like. Based on his sale of Paramount stock over the last two quarters, taking his stake from over 93 million shares to zero, it's safe to say he no longer thinks Paramount has the assets that make a great entertainment company. \"I think I'm smarter now than I was a couple of years ago,\" he noted. \"But I also think I'm poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the manner that I did.\"\nAs mentioned, there are only a handful of opportunities Buffett sees in the stock market, and his stock purchases reflect that sentiment.\nDuring the quarter, he bought just $2.7 billion worth of stocks.\nAbout $1 billion of that went to purchase shares of the Liberty SiriusXM (NASDAQ: LSXMA) (NASDAQ: LSXMK) tracking stocks. The tracking stocks are designed to reflect Liberty Media's stake in Sirius XM (NASDAQ: SIRI), of which it owns 83%. Buffett and his team have preferred the tracking stock as it offers a discount relative to buying Sirius XM shares directly, and may better reflect the intrinsic value of Sirius XM's business. The two stocks are set to merge in the third quarter of this year.\nBuffett also added a small amount to his stake in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). He praised Occidental's assets and CEO Vicki Hollub at the shareholder meeting and said it's an investment he plans to maintain indefinitely in his 2023 letter to shareholders. After a relatively small purchase in February, Berkshire owns a 28% stake in the business.\nThere were a few other stock purchases as well, but we'll have to wait for Berkshire Hathaway to file its quarterly form 13-F disclosing every position with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe only other stock purchase that's been made known is Buffett's $2.2 billion share repurchase of Berkshire Hathaway. He's bought back shares every quarter since the board approved a new policy enabling him to repurchase Berkshire stock whenever he determines the stock is trading below its intrinsic value. He continues to prefer discretionary share repurchases as a means of returning capital to shareholders instead of dividends.\nBuffett's biggest purchase, by far, was not a stock. It was U.S. Treasuries. Berkshire Hathaway uses short-term Treasury bills as a place to store cash. Buffett has long preferred short-duration bonds over long-duration bonds, as they provide more flexibility and less interest rate risk. And with high short-term rates in the current environment, he's getting a great return to just sit on cash.

        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\nOMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway significantly reduced its enormous stake in Apple in the first quarter, as Warren Buffett's conglomerate let its cash hoard swell to a record $189 billion.\nBuffett's company also posted a record operating profit exceeding $11 billion, as its insurance operations benefited from improved underwriting and higher income from investments as interest rates rose.\nThe value of Berkshire's stake in Apple fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, even though the iPhone maker's share price fell just 11% in the quarter.\nBased on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings, in the quarter, ending with about 790 million.\nA large sale is an about-face for Buffett, who is normally tech-phobic but came to view Apple as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\nSome investors, however, have expressed concern that Apple consumed too much of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\nBut the sales leave Buffett with more than six times the minimum $30 billion cash cushion he has pledged to keep.\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\nHe also said \"I don't mind\" expanding the cash stake, in light of alternatives in the equity markets and conflicts around the world, and said cash could top $200 billion by the end of June.\nThe Apple sales resulted in Berkshire's realizing $11.2 billion of after-tax gains in the quarter from selling investments. Buffett maintained that he doesn't mind paying taxes.\nFirst-quarter operating profit rose 39% to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.\n\"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said in a research note.\nNet income fell 64% to $12.7 billion, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks.\nAn accounting rule requires Berkshire to report those gains with its financial results. Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.\nBerkshire also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, and a small amount in the first three weeks of April.\nThe results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.\nBuffett, 93, has led Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate whose dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Dairy Queen and See's Candies.\nThe diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.\nInsurance profit soared 80% to $5.2 billion. This included a more than doubling of underwriting profit at Geico, which benefited from rate increases and a large decline in the percentage of premiums it used to pay for accident losses.\nProfit fell 8% at the BNSF railroad, in part because of lower fuel surcharges and an \"unfavorable business mix.\"\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy saw profit rise 72%, as improved operating performance from utilities helped offset rising legal costs at the HomeServices of America real estate brokerage related to legal settlements over brokerage commissions.\nThe energy business still faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; editing by Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n"

        "Title": "Apple Just Announced a $110 Billion Stock Buyback. Here's Why I Still Wouldn't Buy the Stock.",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Earnings season is in full swing, and all eyes are on the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) just hit the earnings tape with one major headline: a $110 billion stock buyback authorization. This is a notable announcement, as it marks the largest share buyback in U.S. corporate history.\nLet's break down why stock buybacks are important, and analyze some of the other themes of Apple's earnings. After a thorough review of the report, you may want to think twice before scooping up shares of the iPhone maker.\nThe chart below illustrates Apple's stock buyback history over the last 10 years. Clearly, the company has done a stellar job returning capital to investors through a series of consistent stock buybacks:\nOne of the biggest reasons a company may purchase its own shares is because management views the stock as undervalued.\nA more subtle reason why a company may repurchase stock is to increase earnings per share (EPS). This is where one of my suspicions and concerns comes into play.\nBelow is a summary of Apple's annual revenue growth over the last several quarters:\nQuarter ended Dec. 31, 2022: negative 5%\nQuarter ended April 1, 2023: negative 3%\nQuarter ended July 1, 2023: negative 1%\nQuarter ended Sept. 30, 2023: negative 1%\nQuarter ended Dec. 30, 2023: 2%\nQuarter ended March 30, 2024: negative 4%\nFor more than a year, Apple has consistently experienced a year-over-year revenue drop -- with the lone exception being the holiday season at the end of last year.\nWhile a challenging macroeconomic picture with lingering inflation and rising borrowing costs is playing some role in Apple's struggles, there are deeper issues at hand. Specifically, Apple's business in China -- one of its biggest markets -- is decelerating.\nFor the period ended March 30, Apple's revenue in China dropped 8% year over year to $16.4 billion. Much of this was attributable to a stalling iPhone segment, which dropped 10% year over year to $45.9 billion in all countries.\nConsidering that the iPhone is Apple's biggest source of revenue, and China is one of the company's core markets, the combination of decelerating growth in both areas doesn't exactly spell confidence for investors.\nAs sales continue to fall and as Apple remains silent about its ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI), it will become harder for the company to generate strong earnings power.\nRight now, Apple trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28 -- considerably higher than the S&P 500's forward P/E of 20.\nMany of Apple's megacap peers have made notable strides in AI and are already seeing new waves of growth. Apple's silence on this issue is perplexing, and adds to my suspicion that the company is at a crossroads and can't seem to decide on a direction. Therefore, the stock's valuation premium isn't really warranted, in my opinion.\nThe company has over $160 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. So the latest buyback plan looks like an excuse to deploy some capital to distract investors from a consistently declining revenue base and an unclear AI vision.\nWhile Apple could surprise the market with a turnaround, I'm not overly confident that'll come anytime soon. I'd stay clear of Apple right now. The stock looks pricey, and there are better opportunities for growth investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The number of Asian employees doubled to 30%, while the share of Latino workers increased to 15% from 11%. Globally, women account for 35% of Apple\u2019s workforce, up from 30% in 2014. The company hasn\u2019t published new numbers on its website since 2022.\nAt the same time, the broader push for diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, has faced a backlash in corporate America. The proportion of US companies that fund a DEI function is set to drop to just 20% by the end of this year, compared with 33% in 2022, according to Forrester Research.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t\nThe Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\nWhen Business Is Just a Game\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019\nHow the $17 Desk Salad Won\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is facing something unusual as it gears up to report its second-quarter results after the close: low expectations.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial\nIsrael Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short\nOne Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire\nEinhorn Says Markets Are \u2018Broken.\u2019 Here\u2019s What Data Shows\nIts reputation as a haven that can outperform in all market conditions has been refuted this year, as it sharply lags peers with better growth, a clearer AI narrative, a cheaper price tag \u2014 or all of the above. The upshot is, there may be less room for disappointment with a lowered bar, especially with a massive buyback announcement likely.\n\u201cExpectations aren\u2019t very high this quarter, but if we get a better outlook, coupled with some reasons for excitement over AI, we could see the valuation start to expand quite a bit,\u201d said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. \u201cIt might be tough to count on that, but Apple is a high-quality defensive stock, with a lot of shareholder returns and cash flow. The shareholder returns are the dominant reason to have a position.\u201d\nAnalysts expect Apple to add another $90 billion to its repurchase program, suggesting it will follow Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. among the big-tech names that have announced huge buybacks this year. Apple has already spent more than $650 billion buying back its own stock since 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe buybacks have been a way for Apple to support earnings. Revenue is expected to fall almost 5% this quarter, which would represent its weakest rate in more than a year, as well as Apple\u2019s fifth quarter of the past six with negative growth. Overall tech revenue is expected to rise 8.6% this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nThe growth trends largely reflect the Greater China region, which accounted for nearly 19% of Apple\u2019s 2023 revenue. The company has seen weak China iPhone sales as it loses market share to Huawei Technologies Co.\nThe stock is down 10% this year, compared with a gain of 3.9% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. Relative to the tech-heavy benchmark, Apple\u2019s underperformance in the first quarter of 2024 was its sharpest in more than a decade. The stock rose 1.9% on Thursday.\nAnalysts are largely cautious. The consensus for Apple\u2019s full-year revenue has dropped 2.2% over the past quarter, while the view for its net earnings is down 0.8%. Fewer than 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a ratio well below that of other megacap tech.\nStill, such headwinds could be priced into shares following the year-to-date drop. Bernstein upgraded the stock earlier this week, calling the China weakness \u201cmore cyclical than structural\u201d and urging investors to \u201cbuy the fear.\u201d Similarly, Citi sees a bottom in sentiment.\nRead more: Apple Report to Show How It\u2019s Coping With Slowdown: Preview\nThe stock hardly scans as a bargain, though, trading near 25 times estimated earnings. While this is notably below a 2020 peak, it is still above its long-term average, as well as the market overall. Furthermore, other megacaps have multiples that are comparable or even lower despite their stronger growth trends.\n\u201cIt is harder to find an argument to buy Apple compared with the other megacaps,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. \u201cIt can\u2019t substantiate growth, it doesn\u2019t have a killer AI strategy, and it isn\u2019t even cheap.\u201d\nThe iPhone maker is among the last of the megacaps to report, and the group\u2019s results have been mostly positive. Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. all gained, while Meta Platforms Inc. fell on a mixed revenue forecast and its spending plans. Nvidia Corp, the chipmaker most tied to AI, reports later this month.\nRead more: Apple\u2019s OpenAI Talks Intensify as It Seeks to Add AI Features\nA common theme for megacap upside has been AI-related demand, an area where Apple is relatively absent. However, it is refocusing its Macs on AI, news that spurred the stock\u2019s best day in nearly a year last month, and it has been in talks with both OpenAI and Alphabet about adding some AI features to the iPhone. More details are expected at an event in June.\nIf the results feature any further details on its AI strategy, that could provide additional excitement. Otherwise, an aggressive capital-return strategy could remind investors what they like about Apple amid a backdrop marked by high inflation and uncertainty over Fed policy.\n\u201cI\u2019m a long-term Apple bull, and while I\u2019m turning pessimistic about it in the near term, I\u2019m trying to err on the side of optimism,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cHeadwinds seem pretty priced in and it has a huge cash hoard, so repurchasing shares and increasing its dividend could reinvigorate interest. However, until it finds a way to really reignite growth, I think the stock could be stuck in the mud.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nSK Hynix Inc. revealed that its capacity to make high-bandwidth memory chips is almost fully booked through next year, underscoring the intense demand for semiconductors essential to artificial intelligence development.

        "Text": "Apple just launched another round of discounts in China, an out-of-character move for the company as it tries to maintain its position in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nApple started a new round of discounts on Chinese e-commerce platforms like JD.com and Alibaba's Tmall on Monday, slashing prices of the newest iPhone 15 model by over 20%, according to state-run Global Times. Discounts reached as high as 2,300 yuan ($138) on Tmall, Reuters reports. The promotion runs until May 28.\nIt\u2019s Apple\u2019s second round of discounts this year. In January, Apple offered a 500 yuan ($69) discount on its official website in China over a three-day period just before the Lunar New Year.\u00a0Third-party resellers have also offered discounts on the iPhone 15.\nAnalysts say that Apple's discounts are necessary to preserve the company's market position in the country\n\"Apple's second price cut in China this year is a strategic move to defend its share in the premium segment,\" says Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. He suggests that Apple is trading hardware revenue in the short-term for a long-term increase in \"service-related revenue.\"\nAnd Monday's discount might not be Apple's last in China. \"Apple is riding the value-seeking trend in China,\u201d said Will Wong, senior research manager for the Client Devices Group at IDC Asia-Pacific. \u201cChinese consumers are well-informed about price discounts...so it\u2019ll be hard for Apple not to offer similar incentives in the future.\"\nApple\u2019s China revenue dropped by 8% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024, though CEO Tim Cook claimed on the company\u2019s earnings call that iPhone sales in China grew over that time period, without providing specifics. Cook also said the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro Max were the two bestselling phones in \"urban China\".\nGreater China\u2014a grouping that includes mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan\u2014represented 19% of Apple's total 2023 revenue, making it the third-largest region by sales.\nThat datapoint contrasts with a steady drumbeat of independent analysis showing Apple struggling to hold onto its market share. Apple\u2019s sales declined by 19.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, while Huawei and HONOR\u2019s sales rose by 69.7% and 11.5% respectively, according to data from Counterpoint Research.\nHuawei\u2019s sales have been on the rise since it released the Mate 60 Pro series of phones last August.

Two models of the Pura 70 series sold out on Huawei\u2019s official online store just a minute after their release, according to Reuters.\nWong suggests that, instead of lowering prices, Apple needs to offer more \"wow\" factors for Chinese consumers.

        "Author": "  Sweta Killa ",
        "Text": "All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on May 2. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.Apple shares are down about 7.6% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s decline of 3.9%. The trend is expected to reverse, given that the tech giant has a reasonable chance to beat earnings estimates. It saw positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).This has put investors\u2019 focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and sport a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Apple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal second quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year decline of 0.7% for earnings and 5.1% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.The stock has a top Growth Score of A. It currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations. Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 60.71% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.Based on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $204.88. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00.\nOn the last earnings call, the tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the ongoing quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that iPhone sales in the March quarter would be similar to last year\u2019s $51.33 billion in revenues. This excludes $5 billion in sales attributed to outperformance a year ago as supply recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns and caught up with demand (read: Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings).\nApple stock has been struggling with concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Sales of its flagship product are facing significant headwinds in the crucial Chinese market due to rising competition from domestic smartphone makers as well as national security concerns. Additionally, consumers globally are holding their iPhone devices for longer before upgrading, further weighing on demand and sales growth.According to the preliminary data from research firm IDC, Apple lost its crown to South Korean rival Samsung as the world\u2019s biggest mobile phone seller after its shipments fell about 10% in the quarter ended March. Samsung retook the lead in the global market with a 20.8% share, beating Apple\u2019s 17.3% share, which has been dented by slowing sales in China.IDC revealed that Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones in the quarter ended March, down from the 55.4 million units in the year-ago quarter. It was the biggest drop in iPhone sales since COVID-19 lockdowns caused global supply chain chaos in 2022. A separate new report from market research firm Counterpoint Research shows that Apple\u2019s iPhone sales dropped sharply by 19.1% year over year in the quarter ended March in China amid strong competition from domestic brand Huawei.\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Once Referred to Apple As the Best Business in the World. So Why Did He Just Sell 116 Million Shares?",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett is one of the most closely monitored investors in the world. Whenever the billionaire buys or sells a stock, it makes headlines around the global financial community.\nAccording to Berkshire Hathaway's most recent 13F filing, Buffet sold 116 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the first quarter. Just three years ago, Buffett proclaimed that Apple was \"probably the best business I know in the world\" during an interview on CNBC.\nHas Buffett lost faith in the iPhone maker?\nLet's dig into Buffett's latest move, and assess whether now is a time to follow his lead.\nBuffett has a long history of avoiding the technology sector. For decades, dominant features of Berkshire's portfolio included bank stocks, insurance companies, and consumer packaged goods businesses.\nHowever, one of Buffett's most stringent investment criteria is owning companies that generate steady cash flow. While the technology industry often experiences outsized volatility, Apple was seen as a diamond in the rough. The reason? Despite being a tech business, the company is massively profitable.\nSo, in 2016, Buffett turned heads after revealing he took a sizable position in Apple stock. Over the last eight years, shares in Apple have risen over 600%. I think it's fair to say that Buffett made a wise choice in owning Apple stock.\nGiven the meteoric rise of Apple's stock price in a relatively short timeframe, the company quickly became Buffett's top position -- eclipsing more than 50% of Berkshire's portfolio. Even long-term investors have to make tweaks to portfolio allocations from time to time, and Buffett's trimming of Apple stock is a clear example.\nDuring Berkshire's 2024 shareholder meeting a couple of weeks ago, Buffett addressed the reduction of his Apple position head-on.\nHe made an analogy by explaining that the federal government is technically an owner of U.S. businesses via corporate tax payments. Buffett went on to say that the government can change the corporate tax rate in any given year, and that he thinks \"higher taxes are quite likely.\"\nAlthough there's never really a perfect time to sell a stock, Buffett's insights above are intriguing. Basically, he's alluding that if tax rates indeed rise, then Berkshire would be required to pay higher capital gains on Apple in the future.\nSince Buffett is sitting on a multibagger with Apple, it makes sense that he would liquidate a portion of his position and collect some gains before tax rates potentially change.\nEven though Buffett reduced his Apple holding by about 13%, the iPhone maker still comprises a whopping 41% of Berkshire's portfolio. This handily makes Apple the largest holding for Buffett, with his second biggest position comprising only 12% of his portfolio.\nAs of the time of this article, Apple trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.8 -- well above the S&P 500's forward P/E of 20.8.\nWhen a stock trades at a premium to the broader market, it could be because investors broadly view the growth prospects of the business as superior to what they could find elsewhere. Personally, I don't think this idea holds merit with Apple.\nThe company is very much at a crossroads right now. Apple has remained frustratingly quiet as it relates to its ambitions with artificial intelligence (AI) -- an area where all of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers are investing billions.\nFurthermore, Apple's revenue has declined each quarter except one for over a year now. The primary reasons for the company's deceleration are stalling iPhone sales and waning demand in China.\nI suspect Buffett isn't too worried about Apple's current situation. He generally owns stocks for decades, so a bump in the road is par for the course for him. It's hard to question this strategy, as holding on to high-conviction stocks over a long-term investment horizon is a proven way to build wealth.\nHowever, for investors looking for more growth opportunities, I think it would behoove you to pass on Apple right now. While the company could emerge as a leader in AI and ignite some new enthusiasm from investors, I see the stock as too expensive relative to its current performance and would like to see some growth turnaround before scooping up more shares.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "For years, Apple has positioned itself as a champion of consumer privacy, setting itself apart from its tech industry peers Google and Facebook and their ad-based business models that rely on siphoning up as much user data as possible.\n\u201cPrivacy is a fundamental human right,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said last year, repeating a mantra he has made a central part of Apple\u2019s marketing strategy.\nBut Apple\u2019s privacy reputation is starting to show some major cracks\u2014due to mounting revelations about its lucrative relationship with Google, which has been called \u201cthe pioneer of surveillance capitalism.\u201d\nThe U.S. government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against Google has produced some eye-popping numbers. According to recently unsealed court documents from the trial, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to make Google the default search engine on its Safari web browser. That\u2019s up from a reported $18 billion payment in 2021. A Google witness at the trial testified that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenue it earns from search ads on Safari.\nThe details of these transactions, which both companies had taken pains to keep secret, do much to undermine Apple\u2019s rhetoric about being a defender of user privacy. They lay bare how Apple, a company that calls privacy a \u201ccore value,\u201d has been profiting handsomely from Google, known for its voracious collection of personal data. (Google says it does its best to protect user data.)\nFar from seeking to distance itself from Google in the wake of these revelations, Apple appears to be open to expanding the relationship. According to Bloomberg News, Apple has held negotiations to use Google\u2019s Gemini generative AI tools to power new features on the iPhone. The latest reports indicate Apple may be close to a deal with OpenAI but is still talking with Google. Apple is lagging behind other tech industry players in developing generative AI, and such a deal would be a quick way for the company to leapfrog ahead with the technology.\nHowever, an AI partnership with Google would raise yet more questions about Apple\u2019s commitment to privacy. A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed that Google quietly revised its privacy policy last year in an apparent effort to expand the amount of user data available to train its generative AI models\u2014and released the new language on the July 4 weekend to minimize scrutiny of the changes. By tapping into Google\u2019s Gemini for the iPhone, Apple would be associating itself with these tactics.\nWhomever Apple ends up partnering with on AI, the company must be transparent with its users about where their data will go and how it will be used. Apple forged its privacy reputation in 2016 during its high-profile standoff with the FBI over an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino mass shooters. Apple famously refused the FBI\u2019s request to unlock the device, warning it would create a \u201cmaster key\u201d that would break encryption and put the privacy and security of millions of Americans at risk. Cook called the case a \u201ccivil liberties\u201d issue, putting privacy at the forefront of Apple\u2019s corporate brand.\nIn the years since, Apple has taken important steps to protect privacy, including features that require apps to get explicit permission from users to track their behavior and allow users to turn on end-to-end encryption for their messages and other data stored in Apple\u2019s iCloud. But Apple\u2019s deep entanglement with Google casts a large and growing shadow over the company\u2019s claims to be a privacy savior.\nThe fact that Apple is financially benefitting\u2014to the tune of billions of dollars\u2014from Google\u2019s privacy-invasive search engine makes Apple marketing slogans like \u201cWhat happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone\u201d ring hollow. It also adds a distinct odor of hypocrisy to Cook\u2019s frequent jabs at tech industry rivals over their data-hungry ways. At one 2015 event, where the Apple CEO was feted as a \u201cChampion of Freedom\u201d by a privacy advocacy group, Cook took aim at companies that are \u201cgobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.\u201d\nApple\u2019s defense of the Google search deal basically boils down to: It\u2019s not perfect, but there\u2019s no other option. Testifying at the Google antitrust trial, Apple executive Eddy Cue, who negotiated the latest version of the search deal, said there \u201cwasn\u2019t a valid alternative\u201d to Google. In a 2018 interview, Cook said Google\u2019s search engine is \u201cthe best\u201d and talked up Apple\u2019s privacy settings for web browsing.\nThese comments suggest that Apple had no choice but to partner with Google. However, it is important to note that Apple\u2019s relationship with Google goes beyond the search deal. Tech publication The Information reported in 2021 that Apple was the largest corporate client of Google\u2019s cloud storage service. According to the report, Apple \u201cdramatically increased\u201d the amount of user data it stored in Google\u2019s cloud that year and was poised to boost its spending on the service by 50%. The latest reports about Apple\u2019s negotiations with Google over a potential AI deal suggest that Apple is willing to take the partnership even further. Apple\u2019s customers deserve to know more about how the company\u2019s dealings with Google affect the privacy of their data, particularly in light of Apple\u2019s heavy marketing of itself as a privacy-minded corporation. It is clear that regulators are no longer taking Apple\u2019s privacy promises at face value. The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against Apple, filed in March, observes that Apple \u201cselectively compromises privacy and security interests when doing so is in Apple\u2019s own financial interest,\u201d giving the Apple-Google search deal as a prime example.\nKatie Paul is the director of the Tech Transparency Project.\nFannie Mae CEO: Beyonc\u00e9 is right.

This is the second straight quarter that the Buffett-led company has diluted its Apple stake.\nThe iPhone manufacturer remains Berkshire\u2019s top holding.\nEarlier this month, Buffett \u2014 at the annual Berkshire shareholder meeting \u2014 said the dilution has to do with footing the tax bill and the desire to hold more cash due to economic uncertainties.\nAfter adding 15.9 million Chevron Corp.\u00a0(NYSE:CVX) shares in the fourth quarter, the firm sold 3.1 million shares of the oil giant in the first quarter. The latest 13F showed Berkshire owning 112.98 million shares worth $305.70 million.\nBut Berkshire added 4.32 million shares of \u00a0Occidental Petroleum Corp.\u00a0(NYSE:OXY), with its latest stake amounting to 248.02 million.\nBerkshire maintained its stake in its other three core holdings:\nBank of America, Inc.

        "Text": "Thursday, May 23, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (MA) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN), as well as two micro-cap stocks Utah Medical Products, Inc. (UTMD) and Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. (BAER). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Apple shares have lagged the Zacks Tech sector (+10.2% vs. 42.7%) as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year (+10.2% vs. +29.1%) reflecting a combination of the company's China exposure and perception of insufficiently well placed for AI. The company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2024 results suffered from weak iPhone demand. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth.Apple\u2019s results also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption among enterprises. Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s positive comments on plans to expand the usage of AI in the company\u2019s devices and record $110 billion share repurchase announcement reflects strong prospects.However, Apple has been suffering from stiff competition in the smartphone market and weakness in China. Growing legal complexities, including ongoing EPIC and Masimo lawsuits and the latest case by the U.S. Department of Justice, have been a headwind.(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)Shares of Mastercard have modestly outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+24.6% vs. +21.2%). Numerous acquisitions are helping the company to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for the firm's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.It is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital through share buybacks and dividend payments.However, steep operating expenses might stress its margins. Also, we expect general and administrative costs to jump almost 11% in 2024. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)Amgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+9.0% vs. -3.8%). The company beat first-quarter estimates for earnings and sales. It expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024.The addition of Horizon\u2019s rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)Shares of Utah Medical Products have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+26.9% vs. +4.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $237.5 million have witnessed the loss of a major OEM customer which has significantly impacted revenues, leading to a 9.4% sales decline in Q1 2024. Intense competition from industry giants pressures profitability.Nevertheless, Utah Medical Products is well-positioned in the growing medical device market, driven by rising chronic diseases, aging populations and demand for home healthcare. Its diverse product portfolio in obstetrics, gynecology, electrosurgery and neonatal care targets high-growth segments, ensuring sustained demand.The company\u2019s Q1 2024 revenue distribution shows robust diversification, enhancing stability with 45.4% from international sales. UTMD's strong cost management improved the net income margin to 34.9% in Q1 2024 despite increased litigation costs. The company\u2019s solid balance sheet, with $93.8 million in cash, supports strategic growth and shareholder returns.(You can read the full research report on Utah Medical Products here >>>)Bridger Aerospace\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (-39% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $191.82 million taps into the aerial firefighting market, which is expected to witness a modest growth. Risks include high revenue concentration, seasonal variability, steep operational costs, reliance on government contracts, and expansion challenges.Nevertheless, Bridger\u2019s success hinges on managing these risks while leveraging market growth opportunities. The company saw a revenue jump to $67 million in 2023, up 44.4%, buoyed by significant contracts despite a slow fire season. The firm's global reach expanded, entering markets like Canada and Spain, thereby diversifying its revenue sources.Fleet and tech advancements, including acquiring Super Scoopers and a fire surveillance Software as a service (SaaS) platform, enhanced operational capacity. Financially, despite a 2023 loss, adjusted EBITDA skyrocketed 405.4%, with an expectation of future growth.(You can read the full research report on Bridger Aerospace here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today Cambium Networks Corporation (CMBM), Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST).Director of ResearchSheraz MianNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "Text": "Widely followed Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi put out a new report on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) on Monday. The Bernstein analyst had recommended investors just hold shares in the iPhone maker. Now, ahead of its quarterly earnings report expected later this week, Sacconaghi says it's time to buy Apple stock.\nThe analyst's \"outperform\" rating comes with a price target of $195 for Apple. That's a gain of nearly 15% over the next 12 months from Tuesday's closing price.\nApple hasn't been a standout among technology stocks this year. Shares are down nearly 12% year to date. That has come about as investors fear growth is slowing and interest in its latest iPhone offering has been lackluster.\nBut the Bernstein analyst says that's exactly why investors should now \"buy the fear\" in Apple. Sacconaghi thinks weakness in the large Chinese market is just part of the product cycle and is not structural in nature. And that fear has also led to low expectations from Apple with its fiscal second-quarter results due to be reported on Thursday, May 2.\nBut investors shouldn't worry about whether Apple stock pops or drops when it reports quarterly earnings. The stock should be owned based on its financial and business fundamentals. One reason is that regardless of the short-term stock movement, investors will be rewarded with a dividend payment. Other popular big tech companies Meta Platforms and Alphabet recently initiated dividends. But Apple has been paying shareholders over the past decade. And with more than $170 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet as of Dec. 30, 2023, there's little danger of a cut in the dividend.\nEven if the stock drops after earnings, the long-term picture still looks bright. Apple will inevitably continue to release new products and services. Regarding product offerings, Sacconaghi and his team also noted that \"replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI (artificial intelligence) features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle.\" That'd be more good news for investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

While this is certainly a newsworthy development, I do not believe it is cause for concern.\nIt is difficult to know exactly why Buffett decided to sell Apple shares, but one potential reason is diversification. Simply put, the stock has grown to dominate Berkshire's public investment portfolio, and smart risk management argues for somewhat broader diversification.\nAnother thesis that has been put forward is Berkshire trimmed its stake as it had sold other losers such as HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount (NASDAQ:PARA), which generated losses to offset the realized capital gains related to the Apple sales.\nHowever, during Berkshire's recent annual shareholder meeting, Buffett commented on the Apple sale and tax rates:\nIt doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do itAnd if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\nHe continued:\nAlmost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it's been 52% in the past when I've been operating\nBased on these comments, it appears a major factor behind Buffett's decision to sell is the potential to lock in the 21% capital gains rate as opposed to locking in gains at a higher tax rate in the future.\nIt must also be noted that the guru could be selling due to a potential change in his outlook for the stock. Given Berkshire's large position, it would take time for him to liquidate the entire position and thus, he would not want to let other market participants know that he intends on reducing his stake further. However, I believe this is unlikely as Buffett said he expects Apple will continue to be Berkshire's largest public equity holding at the end of the year. Moreover, he also expressed confidence in Apple CEO Tim Cook.\nWhile Buffett's move to sell Apple shares has generated a lot of headlines, ultimately the most important factor when considering an investment is the growth potential.\nDespite Apple's status as one of the largest companies in the world, it continues to have solid long-term growth prospects. Perhaps the biggest potential growth area is in emerging markets. While the company has a strong presence in key markets such as China and India, its market share remains fairly low. In India, the company currently has roughly 6% market share, which is expected to grow to 8% in 2024 by some analysts. In 2023, Apple surpassed Samsung (XKRX:005930) to become the leading smartphone seller worldwide with an estimated 20.10% global market share, having grown market share by 3.70% on a year-over-year basis. Thus, Apple has significant market share gain opportunities going forward to drive increased earnings growth.\nAnother key potential growth opportunity for Apple is its Mac business. In 2023, the tech giant generated nearly $30 billion of revenue from its Mac business. In the U.S., Apple is estimated to have just 16% of the PC market, up from closer to 12% in 2013. Thus, while Apple's Mac business has been gaining share, the company has substantial growth opportunities from continued market share gains.\nIn addition to revenue growth opportunities, Apple is also poised to benefit from margin expansion as increasing revenue allows shared costs such as research and development to be spread across a larger revenue base. Additionally, the company's service business, which is higher margin than other segments, is likely to account for an increasing percentage of total revenue overtime, resulting in margin expansion for the company. Over the past five years, Apple has grown earnings per share at a compound annual rate of roughly 16%. Net income, which excludes the impact on earnings per share due to share repurchases, has grown by nearly 12% over the same period. However, the company has grown revenue at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 8% during this period.\nA key driver of the difference between net income and revenue growth rates has been margin expansion. Apple recently reported second-quarter 2024 results that included a gross margin of roughly 46.60% and a net margin of roughly 26%. Comparably, during the same period five years ago, Apple reported gross and net margins of roughly 37.60% and 20% respectively. I believe Apple is poised to experience continued margin expansion over the new few years, which is likely to drive higher earnings.\nCurrently, consensus estimates call for Apple to report earnings per share growth of 7.30%, 9.40% and 10.80% for fiscal 2024, 2025 and 2026.\nApple currently trades at roughly 28 times forward earnings per share. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at roughly 21 times forward earnings.\nWhile the company's near-term growth prospects are in line to slightly below the broader market, its medium to longer-term growth prospects are much better given the potential growth opportunity in emerging markets, new product cycles and margin expansion. Over the past 10 years, Apple has grown earnings per share at a compound annual rate of roughly 16%. While it might be difficult for Apple to repeat this level of growth over the next 10 years, I believe the company can grow earnings at double-digit annual rates over the next 10 years. Comparably, the S&P 500 has historically grown earnings at a high single-digit rate, which I expect to continue going forward.\nIn addition to trading at an attractive valuation relative to the broader market, Apple is also trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its own historical norms. Over the past five years, Apple has traded at an average price-earnings ratio of roughly 27, which is roughly in line with current valuation levels.\nAs part of its second-quarter earnings release, Apple announced a new repurchase program of $110 billion, which is in addition to the $30.10 billion remaining under the prior buyback authorization as of March 30. The significant increase in the repurchase program suggests management views shares as reasonably attractive at current levels.\nBuffett has reduced Berkshire's Apple stake over the past two quarters. However, the company remains by far its largest public equity holding. His public comments suggest that tax planning played a key role in the decision.\nDespite being a mature company, Apple has considerable earnings growth opportunities due to its relatively low market share in emerging market countries such as India, new product cycles and margin expansion opportunities.\nApple shares are reasonably valued versus their own historical norms and the recent buyback announcement suggests management views the stock as reasonably attractive at current levels.\nWhile I believe the Apple bull case remains intact and Buffett's decision to sell is not cause for concern, investors should continue to actively monitor regulatory developments as the company is currently facing a lawsuit accusing it of using anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly in the smartphone market. The company has managed through other lawsuits historically and I expect this time around to be no different.\nAnother key risk to monitor is that Apple is falling behind in the artificial intelligence race. Recently, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all have launched their own AI-specific products. Apple has yet to launch a flagship AI product of its own, but is said to be in talks with Alphabet to have Gemini power new iPhone AI features. While Apple has been late to the game with AI, I believe there is plenty of time for the company to catch up. The company is expected to unveil its AI strategy at its worldwide developers conference in June.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Has Trimmed 13% of His Apple Stock. Should You?",
        "Author": "  Brett Schafer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The first weekend in May marked the yearly investing pilgrimage as tens of thousands of value investors congregated in Omaha for the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) annual meeting. They went to ask questions and listen to answers from the legendary investor Warren Buffett while also paying tribute to the passing of his late partner, Charlie Munger. Buffett answered dozens of questions throughout the weekend, but it was perhaps a different news item that got the most headlines: He sold some of his Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) position.\nThe largest holding in his gargantuan stock portfolio, Apple is one of the businesses Buffett has praised for their high quality ever since greatly increasing his position a little over five years ago. Now -- for reasons I will get into -- he decided to lower his exposure to the consumer electronics giant.\nShould you follow Buffett and trim your Apple position as well?\nAccording to regulatory filings, Berkshire sold approximately 1% of its Apple stake in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, this accelerated to a 13% trimming, a sizable sale worth more than $10 billion. To be clear, Buffett didn't sell his entire position and still owns over $100 billion worth of Apple shares, but it was the first large trim of his position since loading up on the stock in the 2016-2018 period.\nDuring the annual meeting, Buffett was asked about his Apple sale. He said the sale was because of tax reasons after seeing large gains in the stock. The corporate tax rate is just 21%, which was lowered in 2017 and helped highly profitable businesses such as Apple. Buffett said he was worried the government would need to raise taxes in order to finance its deficit spending. If the corporate tax rate is hiked to 30% or 40% or even higher, Apple will face a significant earnings headwind.\nBut is this the entire reason why Buffett sold? I don't think so.\nBuffett doesn't like to bash his holdings. A lot of people out there listen intently to what he says, which, in the past, has caused him to avoid giving direct stock advice. However, we can look at his criteria for owning a stock and compare it to Apple today.\nThere are three main criteria Buffett looks for when buying a stock: a wide competitive moat, a cheap earnings multiple, and a good chance earnings grow over the next three to five years. Apple clearly has a strong competitive advantage, with all the consumers around the world locked into the iPhone ecosystem. I don't think Buffett is concerned about a moat erosion with Apple.\nI do think he has some concerns over the stock's valuation, though. Apple trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 28, which is significantly higher than the P/E of 10 he bought it for in 2018. Buffett likes to buy stocks with earnings multiples below 15 (and ideally below 10). Apple today is almost twice as expensive as the typical stock he buys.\nEarnings growth is likely also a concern for Buffett. Apple's revenue hasn't grown much in the last few years after a pandemic boom as the consumer market for smartphones, smartwatches, and laptops has saturated. This comes despite its services revenue growing at a double-digit rate last quarter.\nAdd these two factors together and it isn't surprising to see Buffett raising cash and trimming his Apple position.\nThere were a lot of headlines about Apple's record $110 billion stock repurchasing plan. It is perhaps why its stock was up after posting declining revenue in the first quarter. This is the largest buyback announcement of all time and will help Apple reduce its shares outstanding, which has some investors excited. The issue is that $110 billion is small compared to Apple's market cap of $2.8 trillion. It is only 4% of its market cap, a sizable but not significant amount for the company.\nDon't let the buyback headlines fool you: Buffett is probably smart to trim his Apple position. The stock makes up around 50% of his equity portfolio, and he likely doesn't want that large of a position in a company trading at close to 30 times earnings with declining revenue.\nCongratulations to you if Apple has a huge position in your portfolio. The stock has likely made you a lot of money. However, given the current dynamics with the company, it wouldn't be the worst idea to trim this position along with Buffett in order to diversify.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Liam Mo and Brenda Goh\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Apple's iPhone shipments in China increased by 12% in March after the company and its retailers reduced prices, according to data from a research firm affiliated the Chinese government.\nShipments of foreign-branded phones in China increased by 12% in March to 3.75 million units from 3.35 million a year earlier\uff0cdata from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) published on Wednesday showed.\nAlthough the data did not explicitly mention Apple, the company is the dominant foreign phone maker in China's smartphone-dominated market. This suggests that the increase in foreign-branded phone shipments can be attributed to Apple's performance.\nApple's sales surge in March followed a ramped-up discounting effort led by the company and third-party sellers in the run-up to the month, with some iPhone 15 models offered at discounts of as much as 10%.\nThe price cuts appear to have stimulated demand and contributed to the company's growth in the Chinese market. This represents a significant turnaround from the first two months of 2024, when Apple experienced a 37% slump in sales, according to Reuters calculations based on the CAICT data.\nDuring the first quarter of this year, Apple's smartphone shipments in China tumbled 19%, marking their worst performance since 2020, according to research firm Counterpoint. The primary reason for Apple's sales slump was the launch and successful sales of a high-end smartphone by Huawei in August of the previous year.\nApple's recorded sales of $16.37 billion for the fiscal second quarter that ended March 30 in the Greater China region, down 8.1% but above analyst expectations of $15.59 billion, data from Visible Alpha showed.\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Brenda Goh; editing by Jason Neely)\n"

        "Title": "3 Key Takeaways From Buffett's Sale of Apple Stock",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the most surprising bits of news from this year's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) shareholder's meeting was the reduction in its position in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. The revelation that Berkshire's Apple position is now worth $135.4 billion implies that Warren Buffett's company holds around 790 million, marking a reduction of about 13%.\nDumping more than 100 million shares in a short time frame naturally leads to questions as to why. Buffett implied the sale was for tax reasons, possibly in anticipation of higher tax rates in future years.\nNonetheless, Berkshire's history with Apple offers valuable investment lessons, and investors should know three things about Berkshire's sale of Apple stock.\nMost investors know Buffett tends to seek bargains. When Buffett's investment managers first talked him into buying Apple in 2016, Apple stock rarely exceeded a 20 P/E ratio, trading between 12 and 18 times earnings.\nAdditionally, Berkshire bought most of its shares between the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2018. Its market cap was between $500 billion and $900 billion at that time, compared to $2.8 trillion today. While that investment may have taken some time to bear fruit, Apple has earned considerable returns for Buffett's company.\nToday, Apple's P/E ratio is around 28, and it has often traded at a 30 earnings multiple over the last year, a factor that could have led to the decision to sell some of the shares.\nThe Apple sale increased Berkshire's cash hoard to $189 billion, up from $168 billion in the fourth quarter. This takes its liquidity position to record highs.\nTo put that into perspective, only 50 companies trading on U.S. exchanges have a market cap higher than $189 billion. Apple itself has followed this lead with around $162 billion in fair value liquidity.\nThat may lead to speculation about the market's near-term direction and what Berkshire plans to do with this cash. Even though interest rates have risen, storing this cash in short-term Treasurys is probably not the company's long-term plan.\nAs mentioned before, Buffett likes to buy bargains. The market's Shiller P/E ratio, which is the price divided by the average of 10 years of earnings, is 34, well above the mean of 17 going back to 1871.\nThat multiple indicates the market has become expensive, but whether that implies a near-term market downturn remains to be seen. Timing the market is nearly impossible, even for a seasoned investor like Buffett. Nonetheless, if a sell-off leads to more underpriced stocks, having the cash available to act when stocks are inexpensive can boost overall returns.\nFurthermore, Buffett stated that Apple will likely remain Berkshire's largest position at the end of 2024. In a sense, this doesn't say much about the stocks Warren Buffett owns. Even after recent sales, Apple is around 40% of Berkshire's stock portfolio, well above its second-largest holding, Bank of America, at around 12%. That means Berkshire could sell more Apple stock and argue it is a diversification move.\nHowever, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended the recent Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, implying Cook continues to maintain a strong relationship with Buffett and his company.\nMoreover, Buffett recognizes the appeal of Apple and its products, which likely inspired him to buy Apple stock in the previous decade. Thus, Buffett will likely continue to hold an Apple position, even if a market downturn is coming.\nUltimately, investors should not only hold to the long-term investment case for Apple stock but also learn from the investment lessons offered by Berkshire's history with Apple.\nAs previously mentioned, Berkshire bought most of its Apple shares when the stock sold at low valuations. The lesson of looking for bargains has served Buffett and other investors well. The massive and growing cash position may or may not indicate a downturn is coming soon, but investors should have the cash to act when such bargains come along.\nFinally, quality stocks typically remain excellent investments during both bull and bear markets. Riding out previous bear markets has served Apple investors well, and it is likely they should continue to do so in the future.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is It Time to Stop Valuing Apple as a Growth Stock?",
        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been viewed as one of the largest growth stocks in the world. But the growth is slowing. In fact, it's been virtually nonexistent for a couple of years now.\nWith iPhone sales declining and Apple facing intense competition, it's fair to consider if it is best to stop viewing Apple as a growth stock and reclassify it as a premium dividend-paying, blue-chip company. Let's find out if that reclassification would make Apple overvalued relative to other opportunities.\nGrowth stocks tend to fetch premium valuations relative to the market since they are expected to achieve much higher earnings in the future. Investors are willing to pay up for the stock today in the hopes that the growth narrative will play out.\nVirtually every company was once a growth stock. Take Coca-Cola, for example, which we view today as a stodgy beverage company, although it pioneered the global distribution of soft drinks. Or McDonald's, which started as a fast-service burger stand but is now one of the best examples of the franchise business model at scale.\nToday, these companies mainly reward shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Their earnings grow modestly each year, and there's no reason to think growth will take off anytime soon, given limited market opportunities. In this vein, it makes sense that these companies don't fetch sky-high multiples relative to the market.\nOver the last three years, Apple's trailing 12-month revenue is up just 9.9% and its net income is up 15.7%. This slowing growth period is even more apparent if we look back over the last 15 years.\nApple has seen multiple periods of flattish growth, followed by some sharp upticks. The biggest spike came in 2020 and 2021 as investors flocked to goods purchases when services were unavailable during the pandemic.\nSome investors hope that the lack of growth is simply due to the upgrade cycle. Historically, Apple has made annual upgrades to the iPhone, with a more substantial upgrade every few years. However, as my colleague Rick Munarriz points out, the three-year cycle is broken and Apple hasn't had that much-needed spike in sales to drive earnings growth.\nThis upgrade cycle could be delayed because products are lasting longer, and the last upgrade period was inflated by a surge in demand. But until that happens, it's easy to point to increased competition and a lack of innovation as reasons why Apple no longer deserves to be classified as a growth stock. In short, Apple is in \"prove it\" mode.\nThe good news is that Apple is already priced similarly to many other dividend-paying, blue-chip companies.\nProcter & Gamble and Walmart are two industry-leading, historically low-growth companies with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases -- making them both Dividend Kings. Both companies have an element of recession resilience, given their emphasis on consumer staples products and their ability to achieve good results no matter the economic cycle.\nDespite being \"safe stocks,\" P&G and Walmart don't necessarily have high yields. P&G yields just 2.5%, and Walmart is an even lower 1.4%. Still, both companies have over a 25-forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, whereas Apple has a 27.9 forward P/E.\nThe glass half-empty outlook on Apple is that its growth is slowing, and it doesn't deserve a premium growth stock valuation. But its current multiple suggests it isn't overvalued.\nApple is still a textbook example of vertical integration at its best. The rise of the company's services segment has helped Apple retain high operating margins despite much higher revenue. Services help extract more value from existing customers without requiring product upgrades.\nDespite its slow growth, Apple can still reward shareholders with aggressive buybacks and dividends. It just announced its 12th consecutive dividend increase and a $110 billion stock repurchase program.\nIf Apple were not to do any buybacks and focused its entire capital return program on the dividend, it would yield 3.5% -- which is more than if P&G and Walmart poured their entire capital return programs into the dividend.\nApple is an even better value if we consider the size of its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities position, which reached a whopping $162.3 billion as of the recent quarter.\nApple is already being valued similarly to industry-leading dividend stocks. The market is discounting the potential upside of the next iPhone upgrade cycle, which could be fueled by iPhones with artificial intelligence chips. The Apple Vision Pro or another new product could also catch on.\nIn sum, Apple's risk/potential reward profile seems like a good opportunity right now, especially given that the market is no longer valuing it as a growth stock/. But there's still plenty of potential growth left in the tank.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Medha Singh ",
        "Text": "By Medha Singh\n(Reuters) -Nvidia could soon surpass Apple to become the world's second-most valuable company, as the biggest beneficiary of the surge in adoption of AI applications takes on the iPhone maker that has been the largest Wall Street firm by market value for years.\nThe reliance of virtually all artificial intelligence applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT on Nvidia's high-end chips has helped the stock nearly triple in value over the past year to $2.68 trillion.\nIn contrast, Apple ceded its No. 1 spot to Microsoft earlier this year as the once high-flying company grapples with weak demand for its iPhones and tough competition in China. It was last valued at $2.92 trillion.\n\"It is certainly notable because Apple has been so dominant for so long, especially on the growth and innovation front. Recently though, Apple's innovation curve seems to have flattened, showing slower future growth,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\"On the other hand, Nvidia has been able to catch wave upon wave of growth.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) decided to spend even more money on its development. With its latest earnings report, Meta CEO Mark\u00a0Zuckerberg\u00a0confirmed that it will take years for Meta to start making money from AI. Fortunately, Meta has a good track record when it comes to monetizing its assets.\nBut, Apple is still being mysterious about its plans as generative AI didn\u2019t make a big part of the earnings conversation. Once again, Cook only provided a teaser, perhaps somewhat bolder, saying that Apple has big generative AI plans that will differentiate it from its competitors.

Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller.\nBut the interesting question to answer is: Is Apple really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller?\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller surprised the market when he revealed a new take in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his first quarter holdings data. Duquesne Capital bought a $19.6 million stake in Nvidia in the March quarter. After dumping Apple shares in the early 2011, Stanley Druckenmiller never took interest in the stock which remained one of the favorites of hedge funds throughout these years. But his latest move indicates the value investor is expecting a new bull run in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is struggling to take off with its AI plans. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are down about 1% year to date. All eyes are now on Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference as investors believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will reveal some blockbuster AI plans in the event.\nThe closet Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has come to any meaningful AI offering is its new plan to integrate ChatGPT in its iOS 18. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a notable Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) bull, called the possible deal between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and OpenAI a \"golden goose\" for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tim Cook. Ives reiterated a Buy rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a $250 price target.\nApple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) list of risks is long. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has faced consecutive quarters of revenue declines as its iPhone business, Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) bread and butter so far, continues to face growth challenges amid rising competition in China and customers' lack of enthusiasm to buy new iPhones. Major stakeholders like Warren Buffett are also starting to cut their stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). To turn things around when it comes to the stock price, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a historic a $110 billion stock buyback program. But that didn\u2019t move the needle much for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at around 29 times earnings. Estimates suggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) expects to make $6.53 a share in FY2024 on about $385.8 billion in sales, while EPS in fiscal 2025 is expected to come in at $7.13. When compared to peers like Microsoft, which are growing at a much faster rate and have their AI roadmap all in place, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock looks overvalued according to many analysts.\nUnless Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) pulls a miracle or out-of-this-world innovation, iPhone demand isn\u2019t expected to rebound anytime soon due to a plethora of competitors which are making cheaper but quality smartphones, and rising inflation which is hurting consumer buying power. KeyBanc Capital Markets recently said in a report that iPhone demand in April was also \"soft.\"\nInsider Monkey's database shows that 131 out of 933 elite money managers had stakes in Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), down from 134 funds in the prior quarter.\nThe London Company Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cReduced:\u00a0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Reduction reflects strong performance in 2023 and resulting elevated valuation. We believe the outlook for AAPL remains strong with slow growth in iPhone (now #1 global market share) and faster growth in the higher margin services business. R&D will continue to drive new products and AAPL now has over 2 billion installed devices around the world. While near term earnings expectations appear reasonable, we felt it was prudent to reduce the position size based on risks to valuation.\u201d\nApple is not the best AI stock pick of billionaire Druckenmiller.\nApple ranked 4th in our list of Stanley Druckenmiller's 10 Best AI Stock Picks.

        "Author": "  Sonia Rolley ",
        "Text": "By Sonia Rolley\nPARIS (Reuters) -International lawyers representing the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo said on Wednesday they had new evidence gathered from whistleblowers, which deepened concerns that Apple could be sourcing minerals from conflict areas in eastern Congo.\nIn a statement, the lawyers urged Apple to answer questions about its supply chain in the country, and said they were evaluating legal options. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nCongo has been ravaged by violence since the 1990s, particularly in the restive east, where a myriad of armed groups, some of them backed by neighbouring Rwanda, fight over national identity, ethnicity, and resources.\nCongo's lawyers notified Apple CEO Tim Cook on April 22 of a series of concerns about its supply chain, and also wrote to Apple subsidiaries in France, demanding answers within three weeks. The Amsterdam & Partners LLP law firm has been investigating allegations that minerals mined in Congo by several companies and armed groups are being smuggled out through Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.\nThe firm said in a statement on Wednesday that, four weeks later, \"the tech giant has remained silent and neither answered nor even acknowledged receipt of the questions.\"\nOne of the lawyers, Robert Amsterdam, said the firm has since received new evidence from whistleblowers.\n\"It is more urgent than ever that Apple provide real answers to the very serious questions we have raised,\" he said in the statement.\nApple has said in the past that it does not directly buy, procure or source primary minerals, and it has been auditing its suppliers for several years and publishing its findings.\nIn a report last year, it said that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in the supply chain for all applicable Apple products manufactured in 2023 had participated in an independent third-party conflict minerals audit for tin, tantalum, and tungsten, known as 3T minerals, and gold (3TG).\n\"We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,\" the Apple report said.\nAnother lawyer from Amsterdam & Partners LLP, Peter Sahlas, told Reuters that people who worked on Apple's supply chain verification in Congo had come forward to say that their contracts were terminated after they flagged concerns that \"blood minerals\" were in Apple's supply chain.\n\"We are engaging with these individuals and evaluating their evidence and will have more to say once we have completed robust verifications,\" Sahlas said, without giving further details.\nSince the letter issued by Congo lawyers in April, clashes have intensified in eastern Congo where Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have seized control of Rubaya, a key mining town for coltan used in smartphones and other appliances.\n(Reporting by Sonia Rolley Writing by Bate Felix, Editing by Silvia Aloisi and Tomasz Janowski)\n"

        "Title": "Could Investing $1,000 in Apple Make You a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Some businesses have been so successful over such long periods of time that they have made their earliest investors extremely wealthy. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), whose shares are up 38,000% in the past two decades, is certainly one company that falls on this list.\nBut investors who missed the boat on this dominant consumer tech titan might be wondering what the future holds. That seems to be the right question to ponder, given that the business carries a monster market cap of $2.9 trillion today.\nCould investing $1,000 in Apple right now eventually make you a millionaire?\nGoing from an initial $1,000 capital outlay to a $1 million balance means the investment expanded by 1,000-fold. That would be a remarkable gain any way you look at it.\nHowever, we must also consider the time it would take to achieve this. If it happens in 50 years, the annualized return would be 14.8%. If it happens in 20 years, the annualized return would come out to 41.3%.\nIn the past 20 years, Apple shares have climbed at a compound annual rate of 34.6%. The adage of \"past returns don't guarantee future results\" rings true in this scenario. I'm extremely confident that this historical gain is not going to repeat itself going forward.\nIt hasn't been happy days for Apple over the past few quarters. After reporting a 3% sales decline in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple once again saw its revenue dip, this time by 4%, in the first three months of calendar 2024. But the top-line figure came in ahead of Wall Street estimates.\nDespite all of its various product introductions over the years, Apple can still be characterized as a smartphone enterprise. Sales from the iPhone were down 10% year over year. Because this single product represented about half of overall company revenue in Q2, it dragged down Apple's results. It has become clear that consumers don't really feel the need to constantly upgrade to the newest model, especially when updates are not as game-changing as they were in the earlier days.\nApple is also experiencing soft demand in China. Sales in the world's second-biggest economy fell 8%. The smartphone market in this country is becoming increasingly competitive, with domestic businesses giving Apple a run for its money.\nThe bright spot, as has typically been the case recently, is the growth of Apple's services division, which posted a revenue gain of 14%. Boasting a gross margin of 74%, this segment is still a very small part of the overall company. And it depends on Apple selling more hardware devices.\nThe outlook doesn't give shareholders much reason to get excited. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Apple is projected to increase its revenue at a compound annual rate of just under 5% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026.\nNo one will argue against the belief that Apple is one of the world's elite companies. But that doesn't mean it makes for a smart investment.

Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (NFLX), and Apple TV+ (AAPL).\nThe new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast\u2019s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference.\n\"Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,\" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date.\n\"We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,\" he added. \"This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package.\"\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\nOn average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time.\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years.

        "Text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter profits plummeted along with the paper value of its investments, but the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright performed well.\nThe company reported reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That\u2019s roughly one-third of last year's $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share.\nThe figures were heavily influenced by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire\u2019s investments. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate\u2019s operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year\u2019s $8.065 billion as its insurance companies showed strong results.\nOn a per share basis, this year's first quarter operating figure amounts to $7,796.47 per Class A share, beating three analysts' estimates by FactSet Research, who predicted $6,701.87 per Class A share.\nBuffett was a net seller of $17 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire\u2019s massive Apple stake. At $135.4 billion, the iPhone maker still accounts for the biggest share of Berkshire's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects it to remain so even up to when his successor Greg Abel takes over.\nThe estimated value of Berkshire\u2019s Apple stake suggests Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. In the past, Buffett has said he invested in Apple\u2019s stock because of how devoted consumers are to the company's products, similar to consumer brands he loves like Berkshire's own See's Candy.\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago, as Geico in particular continued to improve its results. However, BNSF railroad\u2019s profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion.\nMost of Berkshire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit, adding $717 million to Berkshire\u2019s total.\nRevenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion.\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire\u2019s cash pile climbed to a record $188.993 billion even after it spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year. Holdings including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to spend it but we won\u2019t spend it unless we\u2019re doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\u201d Buffett said.\n"

On the call, he fielded questions on China from at least three analysts seeking clarification.\n\u201cWhat are we missing,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers asked, \u201cgiven the data points that were reported throughout the course of the last quarter?\u201d\nGovernment data of new device registrations showed the iPhone down heavily in the first two months of the year, while analysts at Counterpoint Research saw a 19% decline in March-quarter sales in China. IDC, generally considered the benchmark for tracking the mobile industry, estimated global iPhone shipments slid 10% in the period. The discrepancy may arise from differences in the way analysts and Apple account for revenue.\n\u201cWe tracked a year-on-year decline in total value generated by iPhones in China in 1Q24,\u201d IDC analyst Will Wong said after Apple\u2019s results. \u201cThe average selling price played a key part in explaining why there\u2019s a difference. IDC counted the street prices (i.e. the prices that consumers paid), while Apple is likely using another price level, such as factory price, in its financial report.\u201d\nApple\u2019s shares gained as much as 7.9% in extended trading Thursday, after it announced a $110 billion buyback and a smaller-than-expected decline in global sales. Suppliers in Asia, from Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to LG Innotek Co., surged on Friday after the report.\nApple doesn\u2019t dive deep into geographical data nor reveal iPhone shipments in general, leaving third-party analysts to parse available information. This year\u2019s iPhone sales in China were more heavily skewed toward newer models, Counterpoint analyst Charles Moon said, nudging up the average selling price per unit. That may help explain how the company\u2019s unit sales could be down while revenue was up.\n\u201cMostly it\u2019s the shift in product mix that\u2019s supporting the revenue number,\u201d Moon said. Counterpoint estimates Apple\u2019s global ASP for the March quarter was $900, a new high for the period. \u201cNew models accounted for around 80% share in Q1 2024 versus only two-thirds in Q1 2023, pushing ASPs higher.\u201d\nThe resurgence of Huawei Technologies Co. has transformed China\u2019s smartphone market since the summer. The Shenzhen-based firm, Apple\u2019s strongest rival in the premium segment, reported a six-fold profit surge during the March quarter and was top of Canalys\u2019 rankings for shipments in the country. Like the other researchers, Canalys found iPhone shipments in China down significantly.\nOn Thursday\u2019s call, Cook urged analysts to take the longer view and \u201cstep back from the 90-day cycle.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class\u201d in China, he said. \u201cWe clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world.\u201d\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home\nTesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger\nBoom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That\u2019s a Good Thing\nChris Dixon\u2019s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto\u2019s Grifty Reputation\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Any investment firm with greater than $100 million in investments must disclose its trading activity 45 days after the quarter in which it performed those trades. Then, this information is released to the public, which allows investors to track what greats like Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) have been doing.\nBerkshire Hathaway bought its first Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in 2016, but it has been selling the stock lately. In the first quarter, Berkshire dumped over 116 million shares of Apple, with an estimated value of over $21 billion using the average price of Apple's stock in Q1.\nThis is a huge move considering that Apple used to make up over 50% of Berkshire's portfolio and is now down to 40%. So why is Berkshire selling?\nIt's all about realizing profits -- and taking advantage of an unusually low tax rate on corporate profits.\nWhen Berkshire started buying Apple in 2016, it was a completely different stock. Apple was drastically undervalued despite growing at a rapid pace. While neither of these facts is true anymore, Apple's growth over the past decade has been impressive, and anyone who bought shares when Buffett did and held them along the way has done well.\nOf the shares Berkshire sold, the average estimated purchase price was $39.62 per share. With the average price of Apple's stock being $182 in Q1, Buffett had a paper profit of 359%. That's a fantastic return for only eight years of investing, and anyone would be thrilled with that gain.\nBut with profits come taxes, which is why Berkshire has been selling.\nThe current corporate tax rate is a flat 21%, which means that of its $142.38 per-share estimated profit, Berkshire will have to pay the U.S. government $29.90. In Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett called out that this rate is historically low. Buffett also recalled times when it was 35% or even 52% not long ago.\nAs a result, the company is prudently taking gains now, as higher taxes could be around the corner. The Biden administration has already proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, which potentially puts Berkshire on the clock to realize gains. Whether this occurs is not a debate Buffett seems willing to engage in. He is just aware that the current rate is the lowest it has been, and he wants to use it while it's available.\nIn Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett also clarified that Apple would remain its largest investment unless something unforeseen happened.\nHowever, I think there are other reasons Buffett and other shareholders should continue selling off their Apple stake.\nAs alluded to above, Apple is no longer growing or cheap. In mid-2022, Apple's revenue peaked and began to fall.\nThis isn't a trend investors want to see, yet Apple has maintained an ultra-premium valuation despite this concerning shift. At nearly 30 times forward earnings, Apple is valued higher than companies like Meta Platforms (23 times forward earnings) and Alphabet (24 times forward earnings), big tech companies with meaningful growth and strong offerings in growing industries like artificial intelligence (AI).\nApple has yet to reveal an AI strategy and hasn't launched an impactful product recently.\nWhile Apple remains a well-managed company that will not lose investors' money, it doesn't appear to be innovating like it used to. As a result, I think there are far better tech stocks than Apple to invest in right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has a century-long track record of producing the world's most valuable companies:\nUnited States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company in 1901.\nBy 1955, General Motors became the first $10 billion company.\nIndustrial giant General Electric rode its portfolio of businesses -- from aerospace to financial services -- to a $100 billion valuation in 1995.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) crossed the next big threshold in 2018 when it became the first publicly traded company to amass a $1 trillion market capitalization.\nToday, Apple is joined by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia in the trillion-dollar club. But I think one more company is on the cusp of earning membership.\nWarren Buffett has led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) to a whopping 4,384,748% return since 1965, giving it a valuation of nearly $900 billion. The conglomerate owns substantial positions in private and public success stories like GEICO, Coca-Cola, and even Apple.\nHere's why Berkshire could become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club within the next 12 months.\nBuffett is a quintessential value investor. He likes to buy good businesses at a cheap price, and sometimes great businesses at a fair price, with the intention of holding on to them for decades. He looks for companies with steady growth, consistent profitability, and strong management teams. He especially likes businesses that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\nHere's an example that perfectly displays the effects of compounding that helped Buffett build his empire. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of American Express (NYSE: AXP) between 1991 and 1995. That holding has grown in value to a staggering $36.8 billion today. Even better, Amex stock makes Berkshire money just for owning it, paying Berkshire $364 million in dividends in 2023 alone. That dividend means Berkshire recoups its entire initial investment in Amex every four years just from the dividends. That's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories.\nBerkshire was originally a textiles business, and it was on the verge of failure when Buffett stepped in to buy it in 1965. When he realized he couldn't turn it around, he transformed it into a holding company for various investments.\nSince then, Berkshire has purchased many companies outright, including GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen. But it also owns a portfolio of 47 publicly traded stocks and securities worth $377.9 billion. This portfolio includes its shares of Amex, Coca-Cola, and Apple.\nApple is Berkshire's single largest holding, with a value of $149.9 billion accounting for 39.7% of its stock portfolio. It would be even larger, but the conglomerate recently sold 13% of its position (reportedly for tax reasons). Considering Berkshire only spent around $38 billion accumulating Apple shares since 2016, this investment has seriously paid off.\nI want to take a moment to highlight the Coca-Cola stake, too. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion buying shares of the beverage giant between 1988 and 1994, and it has never sold any of them. Today, that position is worth $25.2 billion, and it paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023 alone.\nYou might notice the Coca-Cola story sounds very similar to the Amex story, and its is. What it points out is that Buffett didn't catch lightning in a bottle, nor is his strategy exceptional. In fact, Berkshire's long-term positions in Bank of America, Visa, and Moody's followed a similar trajectory, thanks to Buffett's simple formula centered around patient investing.\nIf investors are willing to maintain a long-term view, they can also reap the benefits of compounding in the same way.\nBerkshire Class A shares soared in value by 4,384,748% between 1965 and 2023. That translates into a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is nearly twice the 10.2% average annual return in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\nThe outperformance is mind-boggling in dollar terms. An investment of $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth $43.8 million at the end of 2023! The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $312,230.\nBerkshire has the financial results to support its incredible returns. The business generated $49.3 million in revenue during 1965, a figure which grew to $364.4 billion last year. Berkshire's diverse portfolio of businesses contributed to the latter number: $83.4 billion came from insurance premiums; $101.4 billion came from its railroad, utilities, and energy businesses; and $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various entities under Berkshire's umbrella.\nBerkshire also grew its net earnings from just $2.3 million in 1965 to a whopping $96.2 billion in 2023.\nConsidering Berkshire has a market capitalization of nearly $900 billion as of this writing, its stock only needs to gain 11% from here to catapult the company into the $1 trillion club. Its 58-year-long track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns (on average) suggests it's a shoo-in to get there within the next 12 months.\nA few things will work in Berkshire's favor going forward. For starters, Apple just announced a $100 billion stock buyback, which is the largest in the history of corporate America. That will organically increase the conglomerate's equity stake in the iPhone maker. Plus, top holdings like Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola continue to raise their dividends, so Berkshire will likely earn a record payout this year.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is also likely to cut interest rates in the second half of 2024. That could spark an increase in economic activity which should boost many of the businesses in Berkshire's portfolio, especially those serving consumers and those in the transport and logistics industries.\nFinally, Buffett continues to be a big believer in the company's future. He authorized the repurchase of $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023 and a further $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Buffett has now overseen $71.4 billion worth of share repurchases since 2020 alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock.\nAbsent any external economic shocks, Berkshire appears almost certain to be the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club in the coming year.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for June. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks higher in the list, the stock deserves a deeper look. But first, let's see what Cramer was talking about during his programs earlier this week.\nJim Cramer in a latest program lamented over Salesforce's latest declines following the company's weak Q1 results and guidance cut. Cramer said he's been \"championing\" Salesforce ever since the company went public since he's used the Cloud software company's product when he started Street.com. Cramer said Salesforce has been one of the most \"distinguished\" members of the enterprise software industry. Cramer identified competition as one of the biggest threats to Salesforce, since he believes every other \"young person\" coming out of the school majoring in computer science knows if you want to make money you should make or sell software for the enterprise world.\nThe generative artificial intelligence revolution is jolting the SaaS world to its core, according to Cramer, as companies begin to explore the power of AI and question whether they should keep paying for SaaS subscriptions or hire more people when AI-based tools can do similar jobs in a more efficient way.\nCramer's NVDA Thesis Still Holds?\nJim Cramer, however, said that companies that are making AI transition easier for companies are in \"ascendancy.\" He thinks a personal computer equipped with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell Platform could make \"vast swaths of workforce obsolete.\" Cramer has been recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past several months, and in his latest programs he yet again urged investors to buy and hold the stock. However, valuations concerns around NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are increasing. NVDA bears believe the Wall Street's EPS estimate for NVDA for two years from now, which is close to $40 (latest quarterly EPS was $5.98), would only hold if Cloud and software companies continue to buy Nvidia chips at a rate that we are seeing today. Since major Cloud companies are \"front-loading\" chips amid competition and data center boom, it's highly unlikely Nvidia continues to see this high sales and income growth in the long term.\nOur latest research unlocked many AI-related stocks trading at attractive valuations. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nMethodology\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired over the past two weeks and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors having stakes in the company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nA caller highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest show that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock recently shot up after latest data from China showed a rebound in iPhone sales. Data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) shows that iPhone shipments in April surged 52% to 3.489 million units, driven by discounts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is offering to lure back customers. Cramer said the stock jumped on the news but pared back gains. Cramer thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"is a buy here\" and reiterated his age-old mantra:\n\"I want you to own it, not trade it.\"\nInvestors are also looking over their shoulders for any major AI announcement by Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), especially during the upcoming Developers Conference. Bank of America recently reiterated an Outperform rating on Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL).

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air, aiming to reinvigorate a tablet lineup that has languished over the past two years.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMicrosoft\u2019s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings\n\u2018Seriously Underwater\u2019 Home Mortgages Tick Up Across the US\nAmericans Are Racking Up \u2018Phantom Debt\u2019 That Wall Street Can\u2019t Track\nMarjorie Taylor Greene Finally Got What She Deserved: Defeat\nAt an online launch event Tuesday dubbed \u201cLet Loose,\u201d the company introduced the first redesigned version of the iPad Pro since 2018. The new model is thinner, includes a crisper Ultra Retina XDR screen with OLED technology, and has a faster M4 chip that can handle AI tasks. The new iPad Air looks like the prior version, but with a larger screen-size option and the M2 processor.\nThe new 13-inch iPad Pro has a depth of 5.1 millimeters, which the company said makes it the thinnest Apple product ever. The bigger version is a quarter-pound lighter than its predecessor, while the 11-inch model weighs under one pound.\nThe unveiling ends Apple\u2019s longest drought in new iPad releases since co-founder Steve Jobs first introduced the device in 2010. The lineup was previously updated October 2022, when Apple added a faster chip to the iPad Pro and rolled out a redesigned low-end model.\nApple is looking to pull the iPad out of a severe slump. The device\u2019s sales were particularly weak last quarter, when they plunged 17% and missed analysts\u2019 estimates, but Apple predicted that iPad revenue would rebound in the current period.\nTuesday\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t do much to excite investors. That\u2019s often the case with Apple events, since most of the key details get reported ahead of time. The shares were little changed at $181.90 as of 12:06 p.m. in New York, leaving them down about 6% for the year.\nThe M4 chip, which replaces the M2 in the iPad Pro, is the latest installment in Apple\u2019s homegrown processor line. The central processing unit is 50% faster than the one in the current iPad Pro, and the graphics engine is four times faster. The chip is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology, Apple said.\nThe main improvement is the so-called neural engine, which the company says is 60 times faster than its original neural engine from 2017. That will help the iPad Pro handle AI tasks on the device itself. Apple plans to further discuss its artificial intelligence plans on June 10 as part of its Worldwide Developers Conference.\nThe iPad Pro\u2019s OLED screen \u2014 short for organic light-emitting diode \u2014 means that colors are reproduced more accurately and appear more crisp. It\u2019s the same underlying screen technology used in the iPhone and Apple Watch, but on a larger scale. Apple demonstrated how the screen can be far brighter than prior iPad displays and improves content that has a high dynamic range. For the first time, Apple is also offering a matte texture screen option for Pro users.\nPrior iPad Pros used Mini LED screens, a technology that created a blooming effect \u2014 light bleeding through in a way that can muddle an image. The new models come in space black and silver colors, the company said.\nEven with sales declining the past two years, the iPad has remained the top-selling tablet globally. Nearly 10 million iPads were sold during the first quarter, according to research firm IDC, giving Apple a market share of 32%. Still, unit sales fell 9% since last year, IDC said. Samsung Electronics Co. came in second, with 22% of the market. Huawei Technologies Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Xiaomi Corp. made up the rest of the top five.\nAlongside the new hardware, Apple updated Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for the iPad. It also launched a new app called Final Cut Camera to enable iPhones and iPads to provide additional camera angles during video shoots.\nBoth the new iPad Pro and iPad Air move the camera to the landscape side, responding to a frequent request from users.\nApple is attempting to squeeze more revenue out of the iPad line with the introduction of a pair of premium accessories. The new $299 and $349 Magic Keyboard \u2014 an iPad case with a built-in trackpad and keyboard \u2014 is now manufactured with a more durable aluminum material and makes the iPad look more laptop-like. A new $129 Apple Pencil Pro includes new gestures for artists.\nThe company didn\u2019t update iPad mini on Tuesday, but it does plan to make changes to that product as early as the end of this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\nAlong with the improved specifications, the iPad has a heftier price tag. The 11-inch model now starts at $999, up from the prior model\u2019s $799. The 13-inch model is $1,299 and up, an increase from a $1,099 starting price. That makes it Apple\u2019s most expensive tablet yet.\nAll of the new iPads go on sale next week and are available to order Tuesday. The company also cut the price of the 10th-generation iPad to $349 and is discontinuing the $329 ninth-generation model.\nThe M2 chip in the updated iPad Air is coming to both the 11-inch model and new 13-inch version. That\u2019s an upgrade in the M1 chip from 2022 and makes the tablet 50% faster, according to Apple. The 11-inch version continues to start at $599, while the 13-inch model is $799 \u2014 making it Apple\u2019s cheapest tablet with a near laptop-sized screen.\nApple said it made the move to launch a bigger iPad Air after finding that about half of iPad Pro buyers chose the larger version of that model.\nThe new iPad Air comes in blue, starlight, silver and space gray, the company said. The iPad Air includes double the storage, starting at 128 gigabytes. It goes up to 1 terabyte. The iPad Pro starts with 256 gigabytes of storage, going up to 2 terabytes.\n(Updates with the shares in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags\nTim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +9.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 12.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 points to a change of +7.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.21 indicates a change of +9.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $83.07 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $384.68 billion and $405.81 billion estimates indicate +0.4% and +5.5% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nApple reported revenues of $90.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.85%. The EPS surprise was +1.32%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "Apple faces increasing scrutiny over its App Store fees as a U.S. District Judge raises concerns about its practices.\nCarson Oliver, Senior Director for Business Management for the App Store, testified before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, defending the company\u2019s 27% commission on certain in-app purchases. However, Judge Rogers questioned the justification for this rate, citing a study commissioned by Apple that suggested a rate half of that would be more appropriate.\nThe court order, issued by the judge three years ago and now under scrutiny, carries significant weight for Apple\u2019s compliance and the future landscape of online payment options. This development could potentially reshape the tech industry.\nDon't Miss:\nA startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban and opens a round for regular investors at $250.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nThe judge\u2019s skepticism extended to Apple Fellow Phil Schiller, who admitted that a court-ordered change to allow alternative payment systems in the App Store had not been as effective as hoped.\nSince January, only a tiny fraction of apps have implemented these alternative payment options. This has led Judge Rogers to openly question whether Apple is truly committed to increasing competition, as the court intended.\n\u201cDid you understand the point was to increase competition?\u201d the judge asked Oliver.\nThe heart of the issue lies in Apple\u2019s decision to charge a 27% fee on sales through links clicked within apps. The fee applies even when the purchase is completed on an external website as long as it occurs within seven days of clicking the link. Developers argue that this high fee discourages them from using external payment systems, as it offers little financial incentive compared to Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system.\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\nApple\u2019s App Store policies have been the subject of ongoing legal battles in the U.S. and abroad. The company was recently fined $1.9 billion by the European Commission for antitrust violations related to its music streaming service, and it faces a $1 billion lawsuit in the UK from app developers alleging unfair App Store charges.\nThese legal challenges highlight the growing pressure on Apple to address concerns about its business practices and their impact on competition in the tech industry. How the company responds to these challenges will likely shape the future of the App Store and the broader landscape of digital commerce.\nKeep Reading:\nInvest like a millionaire with an exclusive opportunity to invest in Epic Games $17 billion gaming empire.\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Apple's Defense Of App Store Fees Backfires As U.S. District Judge Calls Out Executives originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Title": "Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 6, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA.\nWith Q1 results from Apple and Amazon now out, we only have Nvidia\u2019s results still awaited at this stage of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of companies. The sub-par growth numbers from Tesla and Apple notwithstanding, the Mag 7 group as a whole showed impressive top- and bottom-line growth numbers.\nIn fact, had it not been for the substantial earnings contribution from the Mag 7, Q1 earnings growth for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.\nIt is interesting to note here that the market reaction to the Tesla and Apple releases has thus far been the best of the group. This may look odd since Tesla\u2019s Q1 earnings were down -53.4% from the year-earlier level on -8.7% lower revenues, and Apple\u2019s earnings and revenue growth rates were -2.2% and -4.3%, respectively. But it isn\u2019t surprising as both companies\u2019 results proved better than what market participants had feared. We also need to keep in mind the impact of Apple\u2019s blockbuster buyback announcement, the largest ever in history.\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its March-quarter results on May 22nd, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +49% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.9% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 21.2% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2024 Q1, the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 22.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +28.2% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues.\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 1200 companies reporting results, including 54 S&P 500 members. This week\u2019s notable reports include Disney, Uber, Lyft, Shopify, and others.\nThrough Friday, May 3rd, we have seen Q1 results from 400 S&P 500 index members, or 80% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 400 index members are up +4.4% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.3% beating EPS estimates and 61% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -2.2%, while the growth pace improves to +8.3% on an ex-energy basis.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.7% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> A Positive Earnings Picture Remains \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Carolina Mandl ",
        "Text": "By Carolina Mandl\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Coatue Management dissolved its stake in Apple Inc in the first quarter while Viking Global Investors built a sizeable new position, securities filings showed on Wednesday. Coatue, founded by Philippe Laffont, had 2.4 million shares of Apple in December, worth $470.6 million. Regulatory filings showed it had dissolved that stake entirely by the end of March.\nApple's shares plunged almost 11% in the first quarter as the company faced fiercer competition in China and falling revenues. Shares in the iPhone maker have pared losses in the second quarter and are now down 1.5% year to date. Other big investors have cut their stakes in Apple. Earlier this month, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had trimmed its position by 13%. Still, Buffett praised the company during Berkshire's annual meeting, saying the iPhone was \"one of the greatest products.\" Coatue's filing also showed it reduced its stake in chipmaking giant Nvidia by roughly 68% to 1.4 million shares, or $1.2 billion. Year to date, shares in Nvidia are up 91%.\nCoatue also trimmed its position in electric vehicle maker Tesla by 37% to 2.6 million shares. The company's shares are down almost 30% this year amid fierce competition and slowing sales. Coatue, however, more than doubled its holdings in Google-parent Alphabet, to 5.7 million shares. Conversely, Viking showed in the filing a new $663.8 million stake in Apple and a similar position in Microsoft.\nThe funds' positions were revealed in quarterly securities fillings known as 13Fs. While backward looking, these snapshots show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one of the few ways hedge funds and other institutional investors have to declare their positions. The filings do not indicate exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current holdings.\nBoth Coatue and Viking are so-called Tiger cubs, hedge funds seeded by veteran investor Julian Robertson, founder of Tiger Management.\n(Reporting by Carolina Mandl, in New York; Editing by Chris Reese)\n"

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Marketing Dive newsletter.\nUPDATE: May 17, 2024: Following this story\u2019s publication, a spokesperson for BBH USA confirmed Samsung\u2019s \u201cCreativity Cannot be Crushed\u201d ad is running on social channels and does not have paid media support.\nSamsung\u2019s mobile division has responded to a poorly received Apple ad that critics called hostile to creativity with a spot of its own, per details shared with Marketing Dive.\nIn Apple\u2019s \u201cCrush!,\u201d a giant press crushes art supplies and instruments to forge the latest iPad Pro. Samsung\u2019s video, \u201cCreativity Cannot be Crushed,\u201d shows a person wandering through the wreckage of what appears to be the aftermath of the Apple ad before picking up a battered guitar and beginning to play with help from a Samsung tablet.\nAgency BBH USA and filmmaker Zen Pace moved quickly to pull the spot together following Apple\u2019s stumble last week. Apple issued an apology for \u201cCrush!,\u201d which set off a social media firestorm, and scrapped plans to run the creative on TV.\nSamsung is taking a shot across the bow at Apple as its competitor tries to recover from a widely panned commercial that rubbed creatives \u2014 a big audience for tablets \u2014 the wrong way.\u00a0\u201cCreativity Cannot be Crushed\u201d was executed in a matter of days, underscoring the tight timelines marketers and agencies must adhere to to stay on the ball with fast-moving social media conversations.\nApple has already apologized for \u201cCrush!\u201d and pumped the brakes on some of the media plans behind the creative, which supports its biggest iPad launch in two years. The latest iPad Pro is the thinnest device yet from the iPhone maker, a quality the ad illustrates by depicting a massive metal press smushing an array of objects, including a piano and sculpture, into one compact tablet.\n\u201cCrush!\u201d could be interpreted in several ways, suggesting the iPad Pro contains a world of media capabilities in one place and also potentially referencing the popularity of hydraulic press videos on platforms like TikTok that show industrial machines obliterating everything from candy to spools of yarn.\nBut many viewers perceived the spot, which was produced in-house, as an attack on creativity. Sensitivity around art crafted by humans is higher amid the rise of generative artificial intelligence. Apple promotes the iPad Pro as well-equipped for handling AI (as does Samsung for its tablets).\nSamsung is using the rare marketing miss from Apple as an opportunity to push its Galaxy Tab S9 series, and positioned its commercial as more than just a dig. The spot follows a musician picking up a beaten guitar from a pile of debris and sitting down near a metal platform that appears similar to the press seen in Apple\u2019s \u201cCrush!\u201d The musician begins to strum a song with help from sheet music displayed on a Galaxy Tab S9. A closing text reads, \u201cCreativity cannot be crushed\u201d and then displays the Galaxy Tab S9 Series branding paired with a plug for Galaxy AI.\n\u201cMore than a response, this is a celebration of all creative souls. True artists, makers and creators know that creativity always finds a way,\u201d said Estefanio Holtz, executive creative director BBH USA, in an emailed statement.\n\u201cCreativity Cannot be Crushed\u201d currently appears on YouTube and X, formerly Twitter, with captions reading, \u201cWe would never crush creativity. #UnCrush.\u201d Marketing Dive has inquired about the media plan behind the spot and will update this story pending a response.\n"

        "Title": "Berkshire Hathaway Trims Its Apple Investment and Has $189 Billion in Cash",
        "Author": "  Matt Frankel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) reported first-quarter results on Saturday, and there's quite a bit to unpack. In addition to the headline revenue and earnings numbers, investors always watch Berkshire's cash stockpile, buyback activity, and the operating income from its subsidiary businesses.\nWith that in mind, here's a rundown of the key numbers, a major investment move that was revealed, and the important information we don't know yet.\nWarren Buffett himself has cautioned investors not to pay too much attention to the company's net income (earnings per share, or EPS), as it includes unrealized investment gains and losses from Berkshire's massive stock portfolio. That's especially true for the first quarter, as an excellent first quarter of 2023 resulted in an EPS decline of 64% -- even though Berkshire's business performed quite well, as we'll see in the next section.\nBerkshire's revenue grew by 5%, and it's worth noting that both the top and bottom-line numbers came in significantly higher than analysts had been expecting.\nBerkshire's operating earnings tell us how the company's subsidiary businesses are performing, and these look great. Overall, Berkshire's operating earnings grew by 39% year over year.\nMuch of this strong performance was due to the insurance business. Underwriting income nearly tripled year over year, and investment income grew by 32%, mainly due to the rising interest rate environment over the past year. Berkshire Hathaway Energy operating earnings rose by 72% year over year. The only significant decline was an 8% year-over-year drop in BNSF Railroad's operating earnings, but the rest of Berkshire's business more than made up for it.\nOne of the most important things investors should know about Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly reports is what isn't revealed.\nSpecifically, while Berkshire reports the cost basis of its massive stock portfolio from quarter to quarter, we generally don't know what stocks Berkshire bought or sold (with few exceptions) until its 13-F is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This quarter's filing is due on May 15, so we'll get an updated snapshot of Berkshire's portfolio as it stood on March 31.\nHowever, Berkshire reports the market value of its largest stock positions as of the end of the quarter. Judging by these, it appears that Berkshire unloaded about 13% of its massive Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investment during the first quarter. This would certainly explain the rapid growth in the cash stockpile, as well as the realized investment gains of $11.2 billion Berkshire mentioned in its earnings release.\nBerkshire's buyback activity is always of interest to shareholders, as it provides insight into whether Buffett thinks the company's stock is attractive. While a price below intrinsic value is a requirement for buybacks to take place at all, the pace of buybacks has varied widely over the past few years.\nThe first-quarter earnings report shows that Berkshire spent $2.6 billion on buybacks, including both Class A and Class B shares.\nFor context, Berkshire repurchased $2.2 billion of its shares in the fourth quarter of 2023 and spent $9.2 billion throughout the entirety of last year. So, the first quarter represents a bit of an acceleration.\nAt the end of 2023, Berkshire's cash stockpile soared to an all-time high of $167.6 billion. Simply put, Buffett has found it difficult to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in recent years, and with short-term Treasuries yielding about 5% on Berkshire's idle cash, Buffett is in no rush to pull the trigger.\nTo say that Berkshire's cash hoard grew in the first quarter would be an understatement. Including cash, equivalents, and short-term Treasury Bills, Berkshire now has a staggering $189 billion on its balance sheet.\nFinally, the earnings report was released on the morning of Berkshire's widely followed annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The meeting includes hours of Q&A with Warren Buffett and the heads of Berkshire's insurance and non-insurance operations, so there's likely to be some new information (and investment wisdom) shared throughout the day. We may even find out why Buffett sold a significant amount of Apple. We'll be sure to keep you informed!\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) unveiled a new lineup of artificial intelligence (AI) powered personal computers (PCs) it is calling Copilot Plus PCs. It is teaming up with a number of manufacturing partners, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung and is looking to sell 50 million AI PCs this year.\nIt will also be launching new AI-powered Surface models, which is its own brand of laptops, called the Copilot Plus Surface Laptop and Copilot Plus Surface Pro, which is a flexible business tablet.\nThe devices will come with a redesigned Windows 11 operating system that will have more Copilot integrations. Copilot is Microsoft's AI assistant, and it too will be getting an upgrade based on OpenAI's new GPT-40 model.\nOne of the big AI features that Microsoft demonstrated is called Recall. The tool will internally track a user's actions across both the web and device and allow them to search for and retrieve these actions, whether a PowerPoint presentation, a chat conversation in a third-party app, or the name of a restaurant the user was looking at on a website. The information, meanwhile, will remain secure on the device.\nThe new AI PCs are expected to begin to ship in June with prices starting just under $1,000.\nWith its new lineup of computers, Microsoft is taking direct aim at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). At the event, the company specifically called out that Copilot Plus PCs are 58% faster than Apple's M3 MacBook Air. It also talked up how light and thin the devices are, something Apple always prides itself on.\nMicrosoft has clearly taken the early lead over Apple in the AI race. However, Apple is not standing by idly. In fact, there have been reports that a top Apple executive was just in Taiwan to meet with executives at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) looking to secure all their new 2-nanometer chip-making capacity to build its own AI chips.\nApple is TSMC's largest customer by far, so it has some pull, and it is believed that Apple made the same move when TSMC moved to 3-nanometer technology. However, given the current demand for AI chips, the stakes are higher, and Apple could ice out some of its competition.\nMicrosoft has been at the forefront of AI through its partnership and large investment in OpenAI. Azure, its cloud-computing offering, has been the biggest beneficiary so far, but the company has seen AI help drive growth throughout its various business segments.\nApple, meanwhile, has thus far been an AI laggard, while at the same time it has had to deal with falling iPhone demand in China. Its app-store commissions have also been reduced in Europe, and the company is being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice for \"monopolizing smartphone markets.\"\nThis has led to a revenue-growth divergence between the two companies, with Microsoft growing its most-recent quarterly revenues by 17%, while Apple saw its revenue fall 4%.\nMSFT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\nMicrosoft currently has a higher forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple than Apple, trading at 37 times versus 29 times for Apple. However, given its much higher revenue growth, this is more than justified.\nAt this point in time, Microsoft has surpassed Apple as an innovation leader and is the better stock to buy. I wouldn't count Apple out, but it has relied too heavily on its brand power and needs to return to its innovative roots.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Myles Udland    \u00b7 Head of News",
        "Text": "The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) annual shareholders meeting on Saturday was the first in a new era for the conglomerate.\nSaturday's meeting marked the first time CEO Warren Buffett took questions from shareholders following the death of Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger late last year at the age of 99.\nIn his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett called Munger the \"architect\" of the modern Berkshire Hathaway, which takes its name from a now-defunct textile company in New England and has grown to be the largest conglomerate in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\nFor the first time, non-shareholders were also able to watch the annual shareholders' movie, which featured a montage of some of Munger's best punchy quotes through the years, as well as some of the celebrity cameos that have been featured in these movies.\nBuffett, along with Berkshire vice chairs Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, took several hours of questions from shareholders.\nIn the early going of the Q&A, Buffett discussed the company's decision to pare its holdings of Apple (AAPL) during the first quarter, saying that while the company did sell shares, it is, in his view, \"extremely likely\" that the company will remain its largest equity investment at the end of the year.\nAs expected, Buffett fielded several questions about artificial intelligence and the impact it could have on Berkshire's portfolio or other considerations for investors. Buffett said time and again he is no AI expert, at one point characterizing himself as someone who \"doesn't understand a damn thing about it.\"\nStill, Buffett analogized the advent of the AI boom to the discovery of the nuclear bomb on more than one occasion, saying these two technologies are proverbial genies that cannot be put back in the bottle.\nAs for the company's growing pile of cash and Treasury holdings, Buffett said it is likely the value of these holdings will exceed $200 billion during the current quarter, noting he's \"quite satisfied\" with the position.\nAsked about Berkshire's appetite for increasing investments overseas, and in China specifically, Buffett said, \"Our primary investments will always be in the United States.\"\nOn succession, Buffett said Abel should be in charge of directing Berkshire's investments after his passing. Abel is set to take over as Berkshire CEO after Buffett; investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler joined the company over a decade ago and have contributed to many changes within Berkshire's equity portfolio over those years.\nToward the end of the proceedings, Buffett spoke about Federal Reserve policy for the first time, suggesting to shareholders that the US government's accumulated deficit garners more of his attention than Fed policy.\nAt the conclusion of the Q&A session, Buffett left the audience with a last bit of wit \u2014 \"I not only hope that you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\"\nWarren Buffett loves index funds.\nIn his 2016 letter to shareholders, he wrote: \"If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be [Vanguard founder] Jack Bogle.\"\nAccordingly, Buffett has recommended most investors put most of their money in index funds that track the broader market. And that includes family.\nOn Saturday, Buffett was asked by a shareholder who submitted a question to CNBC's Becky Quick about his prior comments that he has 90% of his wife's inheritance in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund.\nThe shareholder, specifically, wanted to know whether the current weighting of tech companies within the index would move Buffett to consider shifting this allocation to something like an equal-weighted index fund, which is what the name implies: a fund that holds all members in the S&P 500 in an equal proportion, rather than proportionally by size, the way the index is constituted.\nLast fall, as the S&P 500 stumbled and Wall Street strategists offered views on what was next for the market, strategists were arguing for the merits of a position in the equal-weighted index given the run the \"Magnificent Seven\" had had to that point.\nFast forward six months, and the market is in much the same place.\nIn response to the question on Saturday, Buffett simply said: \"That's an interesting question.\"\nOf course, Buffett's responses are never (quite) that brief. And, in the end, Buffett noted he's made no recommended investment changes amid regular revisions of his will.\nBuffett added that given how much money his wife is set to inherit, it doesn't matter whether she outperforms the S&P 500 or not. \"The main thing is that she feels she's in a financial position ...that she doesn't even need to think about it,\" Buffett said.\nParamount (PARA) was a bad investment for Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A BRK.B), one made fully by Warren Buffett.\n\"It was 100% my decision,\" Buffett acknowledged. He noted Berkshire has sold out of Paramount.\n\"I lost money, and I did it all by myself,\" Buffett added.\nParamount shares are down 44% in the past year.\nThe company is now locked in a takeover battle that could be coming to an end soon.\nParamount shareholder and Ariel Investments founder John Rogers told Yahoo Finance (video below) this week that he fully supports the $26 billion offer reportedly put forth by Apollo (APO) and Sony (SONY). The other bidder includes studio outfit Skydance.\n(Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nIn the closest thing we've gotten today to a macro comment on the market from Warren Buffett, the Berkshire CEO said when asked about why the company has been so cautious around new opportunities: \"We just haven't seen anything that makes sense.\"\nSome of the main themes to emerge from Saturday's meeting \u2014 in addition to the absence of Charlie Munger \u2014 were Berkshire's decision to pare its holdings in Apple (AAPL) during the first quarter and Buffett's lack of enthusiasm for new opportunities.\nHaving gone many years without a splashy acquisition to add to the Berkshire portfolio, Buffett said this has not been a time when the phone has been ringing off the hook.\nBack in his 2014 annual letter to Berkshire shareholders \u2014 which followed a particularly acquisitive run for Berkshire, after which Buffett said the firm owned nine-and-a-half of the firms that would be listed in the Fortune 500 \u2014 Buffett wrote: \"Our lines are out.\"\nThe next year, Berkshire bought Precision Castparts for $37 billion. The company has not made a sizable acquisition since.\nMoreover, the company's biggest outlay of capital toward any idea in the nearly decade since the Precision deal has been its purchases of Apple stock.\nA big vote of confidence for Buffett's successor, Greg Abel.\nIn response to a question, Buffett said Abel will have the final say over Berkshire's (BRK.A BRK.B) stock portfolio.\n\"He understands businesses,\" Buffett said of Abel. \"The responsibilities should entirely be with Greg.\"\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk hasn't hidden his desire to be a big player in the auto insurance industry.\nHowever, Warren Buffett, CEO of GEICO owner Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A BRK.B), offered up this dose of wisdom at the annual shareholder meeting when asked about Tesla and insurance:\n\"Insurance always looks easier than it is. It's so much fun because you get the money at the start, you know, and then you find out that you've done something stupid later on. But it's a very tempting business when somebody hands you money, and you hand them a little piece of paper.\"\nAdded Berkshire's insurance chief Ajit Jain: \"Tesla has been toying with the idea of writing insurance directly \u2014 it hasn't been much of a success.\"\nThis year's Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting has so far featured a very reflective Warren Buffett.\nWith Saturday marking the first Berkshire annual meeting since Charlie Munger's passing in November, the absence of Buffett's longtime right-hand man has, as one would expect, influenced the proceedings.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith reported from inside the building in Omaha, Neb., Saturday is a \"tough day\" for Berkshire shareholders.\nBut Munger's absence has been felt in more ways than one.\nBuffett, at one point, turned to Charlie for his input on an answer, only to catch himself and earn a cheer from the audience\nBuffett also regaled the audience with a tale of the two stocks former vice chair Charlie Munger argued most forcefully Berkshire needed to buy \u2014 BYD (BYDDY) and Costco (COST) \u2014 and conceded he didn't listen enough on the latter.\nLongtime shareholders can likely insert their own imagined Munger one-liner in response. Without Munger's presence, Buffett's reflection more clearly lingered over the proceedings.\nAnd while it is not breaking news that an executive approaching his mid-90s might be reflecting more than forecasting, Buffett's overall tone Saturday is one that has been far more explicit about both his limitations today and his future inability to remake Berkshire Hathaway.\nBuffett noted that, at the age of 93, he doesn't operate \"at the same level of efficiency\" as he did a few decades ago. The Oracle of Omaha quipped he likely won't be signing any four-year employment agreements.\nOn artificial intelligence, Buffett offered a view that some of his experiences with the technology have made him nervous.\nBut he said, in the end, \"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and an enormous potential for harm.\"\nWhen asked by shareholders about future investments in China, Canada, and India, Buffett offered similar versions of a perspective that he held a limited view of what could one day be possible.\nBuffett noted that American companies would likely always be the most prominent part of Berkshire's portfolio. How the percentages may change will, Buffett knows, not be his call in the decades ahead.\nInsurance rates nationwide, across policy types, have soared in recent years.\nAnd no state has seen more turmoil than Florida.\nAsked Saturday about the condition of the Florida insurance market, Berkshire Hathaway vice chair Ajit Jain, who runs the conglomerate's sprawling insurance operations, said the state's insurance markets have had \"a few tough years.\"\nCiting challenges with the state's legal system and storms that have caused considerable damage in the state in recent years, Jain said the state has been one where it has been \"very difficult for a risk-bearer to make money.\"\nIn March, auto insurance rates in the US rose 22.4% over the prior year, the most in 47 years. The average auto insurance premium in Florida now stands north of $2,900 a year, the third-most expensive in the country.\nJain also noted that Florida is a market currently subsidized by the rest of the country \u2014 meaning that, on balance, as a state with a higher rate of more expensive claims, insurance operators in Florida make up these costs by collecting premiums in less volatile markets \u2014 but said this dynamic won't \"stand the test of time.\"\nIn the longer term, though, Jain appeared optimistic about the market, saying: \"I hope Florida will be a fairly buoyant insurance market. Because at the end of the day, they do believe in the free market more than some of the other states that have [an] insurance crisis, like California and New York.\"\nWith Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates in the room, Warren Buffett struck a cautious tone on artificial intelligence.\nHe said he had an experience with AI that made him very \"nervous.\"\nHe saw an image of himself \"in front of his eyes\" that had his voice, was wearing his clothes, and delivered a message that was in \"no way from him.\"\n\"If I was interested in investing in scamming, [AI] is going to be the growth industry of all time. ... Obviously, AI has potential for good things too. ... As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and an enormous potential for harm,\" Buffett said.\nBYD (BYDDY) and Costco (COST).\nThose are the two stocks Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday that Charlie Munger argued hardest for in their years together.\n\"Charlie twice pounded the table with me and said, 'Buy, buy, buy.' BYD was one of them, and Costco was the other,\" Buffett told shareholders. \"I should've been more aggressive in Costco.\"\n\"It wasn't fatal that we weren't,\" Buffett added. \"But [Charlie] was right, big time, in both companies.\"\nBuffett's answer came in response to a question from a shareholder about what it would take for the company to increase its investments in China. Currently, EV maker BYD is the company's only investment in the country.\nBuffett said: \"Our primary investments will always be in the United States.\"\nWarren Buffett is sitting on gobs of cash at Berkshire (BRK.A BRK.B), but don't expect any large deal to come from overseas.\nBuffett reiterated his love for investing in America:\n\"You won't find us making a lot of investments outside of the United States, though we're participating through these companies in the world economy. I understand the United States rules, weaknesses, [and] strengths. ... I don't have the same feeling generally around the world. And the lucky thing this is that I don't have to.\"\nBuffett did reaffirm his commitment to investing in Japan, however.\nAs Myles Udland pointed out, Berkshire (BRK.A BRK.B) sold some Apple (AAPL) shares in the first quarter.\nBuffett moved quickly to quiet concerns about the tech giant, saying this about whether his views on Apple have changed:\n\"No, but we have sold shares. ... At the end of the year, I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have now. ... Charlie and I looked at common stocks ... as being businesses, so when we own a Dairy Queen or whatever it may be, we look at that as a business. ... We always look at every stock as a business.\"\nBuffett later compared Apple to longtime holdings American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO), noting that Apple will be a holding when Greg Abel takes over.\nYahoo Finance's Michael Kelley contributed to this post.\n... It doesn't show on Berkshire's (BRK.A BRK.B) cash and Treasury bill line on the balance sheet.\nBerkshire disclosed it held cash and T-bills of $182 billion at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders the number could reach $200 billion at the end of the second quarter.\nConcerns about the country's debt have started to pick up on Wall Street.\nBelow is what Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan told Yahoo Finance about our country's debt.\nIn case you ever need this fodder at a cocktail party...\nA major driver of Berkshire's $11.22 billion in operating profit in the first quarter came from the company's insurance operations, which totaled $5.2 billion in the first quarter.\nIn a discussion of the company's first quarter results, Buffett said Ajit Jain, who leads Berkshire's insurance operations, \"wants me to point out to everyone that you cannot take the insurance earnings of the first quarter and multiply by four. It just doesn't work that way in insurance.\"\nThe company's insurance risks are spread across geographies and disaster types, but Buffett noted that a major storm along the East Coast of the US would probably be the biggest risk for the firm. Hurricane season in the Atlantic runs from June through November.\nFor the first time, Berkshire Hathaway made its annual shareholder video public on Saturday. The video \u2014 which precedes the Q&A session at the annual meeting \u2014 featured a compilation of Charlie Munger and some of his best one-liners, a fixture at annual meetings and in other public appearances.\nMunger died in November 2023 at the age of 99.\nOne of the Mungerisms featured in the movie included Munger telling an earlier shareholder meeting: \"If I can be optimistic when I'm nearly dead, surely the rest of you can handle a little inflation.\"\nElsewhere, Munger added: \"The right way to make decisions in practical life is based on your opportunity costs. When you get married, you have to choose the best that will have you. And the rest of your life is the same damn way.\"\nAhead of Saturday's annual shareholder meeting, Berkshire Hathaway reported first quarter earnings that showed a record operating profit of $11.22 billion.\nIn the first quarter of last year, operating profits at Berkshire tallied $8.1 billion.\nThe company's investment gains, however, were down sharply from the prior year period, tallying just $1.48 billion against some $24.75 billion last year.\nApple's (AAPL) roughly 10% decline in the first quarter weighed on results here, with the tech giant accounting for around 40% of Berkshire equity holdings.\nIn its first quarter report, Berkshire also disclosed it lightened up its Apple holdings during the first quarter. At the end of 2023, the value of Berkshire's Apple position stood at $174.3 billion; at the end of Q1, this position's value stood at $135.4 billion.\nAt last year's annual meeting, Buffett took time, however, to emphasize to investors that this stock does not actually comprise this percentage of Berkshire's overall portfolio, which includes its other fully-owned subsidiaries.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Apple has launched a legal challenge against the 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) fine assessed by the European Commission for breaking competition laws and unfairly favoring its own music streaming service over rivals including Spotify.\nAccording to court records, the U.S. tech giant filed an appeal with the EU\u2019s Luxembourg-based General Court earlier this month.\nMore from Billboard\nApple Fined Nearly $2B European Union Over Music Streaming\u00a0Competition\nAfter Claiming ILLIT's Label Plagiarized NewJeans, ADOR CEO Sued for Defamation by HYBE Imprint\nRose Villain's Gentle Revolution: Meet Italy's Chart-Topping Artist With a Vision for the Future\nDetails of what is contained in the legal action, listed as: \u201cApple and Apple Distribution International v Commission,\u201d are not yet publicly available. Representatives of\u00a0Apple and the\u00a0European Commission\u00a0did not respond to requests to comment.\nApple had previously said it would appeal the EU\u2019s fine, which was handed down in March following a long-running investigation triggered by complaints from Swedish streaming service Spotify.\nAt the time of the ruling, the European Commission\u2019s Margrethe Vestager said Apple had \u201cabused its dominant position\u201d for almost a decade by restricting rival music streaming apps from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the App Store.\nAs a result, many users paid \u201csignificantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions\u201d because of the high fee imposed by Apple on developers, which was then passed on to users, the commission said.\nApple has always strongly denied those claims, arguing that EU investigators had failed \u201cto uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm.\u201d The commission\u2019s decision \u201cignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,\u201d the tech company said in a statement two months ago.\nThe nearly $2 billion fine was issued as part of an ongoing EU-wide effort to rein in the global dominance of big tech companies through large financial penalties and regulatory measures.\nIn March, just a few days after Apple received its penalty notice, new EU rules came into force governing how the largest online platforms operate in Europe as part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA).\nThe DMA requires the six tech giants designated as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d by the European Commission \u2014 Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, TikTok-owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft \u2014 to comply with a raft of provisions, including not favoring in-house services at the expense of third-party providers.\nThe laws are enforceable by fines of up to 20% of total worldwide turnover (a.k.a. gross revenue) or, in extreme cases, the \u201clast resort option\u201d of forced divestments and the break-up of businesses.\nIn response, companies like Apple have been overhauling how they operate in the 27-member EU bloc, allowing European users to download rival app stores and lowering the fees charged to developers for purchases made through the App Store.\nHowever, Apple\u2019s plans to charge \u201chigh volume\u201d services with over 1 million users a \u20ac0.50 ($0.54) \u201ccore technology fee\u201d per download, per year, for using alternatives to the App Store has been heavily criticized by a number of European businesses, including Spotify and Deezer.\nOn March 25, the EU announced that it was investigating Apple, along with Meta and Alphabet, for potential breaches and non-compliance with the DMA\u2019s terms.\nApple\u2019s legal challenge against the commission\u2019s $1.95 billion fine opens yet another battlefront with EU regulators. The tech company has previously had some success in the General Court \u2014 the European Union\u2019s second-highest court, which hears cases brought by companies against the commission.\nIn 2020, EU judges overturned a previous ruling by the commission that Apple had underpaid 13 billion euros in taxes to the Irish government. That case subsequently went to the European Court of Justice and is still slowly making its way through the legal process.\nApple\u2019s latest court fight could be just as longwinded and take several years before any ruling is made by the General Court, which would also be open to appeal. \nBest of Billboard\nFour Decades of 'Madonna': A Look Back at the Queen of Pop's Debut Album on the Charts\nChart Rewind: In 1990, Madonna Was in 'Vogue' Atop the Hot 100\nConcerts' Comeback Brought a Record Year for Latin Tours\n"

        "Title": "Exclusive-Apple supplier Foxconn among firms asked to cut power use in Vietnam, sources say",
        "Author": "  Francesco Guarascio and Ben Blanchard ",
        "Text": "By Francesco Guarascio and Ben Blanchard\nHANOI/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Vietnamese officials have called on Apple supplier Foxconn to voluntarily reduce power use by 30% at its assembly plants in the north of the country where there were electricity outages last year, two people familiar with the matter said.\nThe request for energy-saving measures, which two other industry sources said was sent to multiple manufacturers, is precautionary and aimed at averting a repeat of last summer when power shortage led to over a billion dollars in lost output.\nThe request to Foxconn was \"an encouragement\", not a requirement and has not had any impact on production, one of the people said.\nVietnam is increasingly welcoming multinational companies, some spreading their risk from traditional manufacturing base China amid rising trade tension with the U.S. Last month, Apple promised further spending in the country where over the past year it has raised its number of suppliers to 35 from 25.\nThe southeast Asian nation relies on foreign investment for economic growth and has been trying to attract energy-intensive industries, such as semiconductor manufacturing.\nHowever, a heat wave last May and June triggered a power shortage that interrupted business in the north, causing $1.4 billion worth of loss, or 0.3% of gross domestic product, World Bank preliminary estimates showed.\nIn March, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh pledged to foreign investors that power shortages would not happen again.\nThe government has asked coal-fired power plants to delay maintenance to meet higher electricity demand in the hottest months, one of the people said.\nThe people did not specify who sent the requests, when the request to Foxconn was sent or for how long the voluntary cut in electricity use would be needed. One person said the request was open-ended.\nAll sources asked to remain anonymous because the matter was not public. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\nCOORDINATION\nFoxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry, is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer. It has half a dozen plants in northern Vietnam including in Bac Giang province where local authorities said it assembles Apple MacBooks and iPads.\nState-owned provincial power distributor Bac Giang Power Company (BG PC) said in March it had asked industrial parks and authorities \"to coordinate in implementing electricity savings,\" showed a statement on the website of power regulator ERAV.\nBG PC Deputy Director Do Binh Duong, in a separate statement, said \"adjustment of power loads, adjustment of production plans and electricity saving implementation of enterprises will have a great impact on the power system\".\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade and state-owned power provider Vietnam Electricity (EVN), of which BG PC is a unit, did not respond to requests for comment.\nEnergy-saving measures appear to differ nationwide. An official at an industrial park in another northern province said manufacturers have been asked to reduce power consumption on some days this month.\nWeather conditions are less challenging than in 2023 but authorities have boosted imports of coal and encouraged energy-saving to avoid shortages.\nIn March, foreign chambers of commerce urged the government to guarantee power supply, with South Korean's KoCham saying semiconductor companies had delayed investment decisions because of power supply risk.\n(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio in Hanoi and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Additional reporting by Khanh Vu and Phuong Nguyen; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n"

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "Apple is offering a new range of steep discounts for iPhone 15 models to consumers in mainland China, with online retail platforms bringing prices to a new low amid the US tech giant's efforts to boost sluggish sales in the world's biggest smartphone market.\nThe top-of-the-line 256-gigabyte iPhone 15 Pro Max model, for example, on Monday started selling for 7,949 yuan (US$1,100) on Apple's official online stores on JD.com and Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall platform - down 2,050 yuan, or 20 per cent off, from its 9,999-yuan price tag when the new series was released last September. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nThe basic 128GB iPhone 15 model, meanwhile, now costs 23 per cent less at 4,599 yuan, down from its previous price of 5,999 yuan, on both JD.com and Tmall. The sale runs from May 20 to 28, according to the two platforms.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nApple's mainland online Apple Store, however, kept the recent prices of iPhone 15 models unchanged.

Apple was overtaken by Vivo's 17.4 per cent share and Honor's 16.1 per cent.\nHuawei Technologies, which had been riding its successful 5G handset comeback with the Mate 60 Pro, was ranked fourth with a 15.5 per cent market share in the same period.\nStill, the recent iPhone discount drives appear to have helped Apple. Shipments of foreign-branded smartphones in March grew 12 per cent from the same period last year, according to data published earlier this month by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology earlier this month. The state-run academy did not identify the brand, but the bulk of foreign handsets sold on the mainland are from Apple.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since early last year, it's become crystal clear that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are causing a paradigm shift in technology. Nowhere is that more evident than in the list of companies that are among the world's most valuable, measured in terms of market cap.\nMicrosoft made headlines over the past year or so with its definitive moves in generative AI and is currently the only company with a market cap above $3 trillion. Apple has been toying with AI for years, and while it ceded its market cap crown to Microsoft, it continues to cling stubbornly to second place, worth $2.9 trillion. Nvidia has moved up the ranks quickly thanks to its industry-leading AI-centric computer chips, currently worth $2.3 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms round out the other top 10 AI players, with market caps of between $2.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion.\nWith a market cap of roughly $789 billion (as of this writing), it seems clear that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is bucking for membership in this elite fraternity. Given the accelerating demand for the semiconductors needed for AI, TSMC's admittance might come sooner than later.\nAs the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC is in an enviable position in the industry. The company doesn't make semiconductors for its own use, but rather is contracted to make them for big tech companies, including Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others.\nOnce upon a time, the bulk of TSMC's revenue came from processors used in smartphones, but high-performance computing (HPC), which includes chips used for AI, has taken the top spot, recently accounting for 46% of revenue.\nBusiness is picking up. In the first quarter, revenue climbed 16.5% to $18.9 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 edged 5% higher. Management is expecting its accelerating growth to continue, forecasting second-quarter revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 28%.\nTSMC is in an enviable position in the AI revolution. It's a foundry partner to the AI stars, and since it makes chips for all comers, it's not a part of the fierce competition for AI chip supremacy. Given its position in the space and its current size, I don't think it will take very long to join the society of trillionaires.\nAccording to Wall Street, TSMC is poised to generate revenue of $84.8 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 9.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSM would have to grow its revenue to roughly $107 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nInterestingly, Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 22% in both 2024 and 2025. If the company achieves those fairly reasonable benchmarks, it could easily achieve a $1 trillion market cap by 2026.\nThere could be much more to come. TSM's management expects the company's AI-related revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the coming five years and account for 20% of TSM's total revenue by 2028.\nThat's not surprising, considering the magnitude of the opportunity. Generative AI is expected to generate economic value of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. However, estimates continue to ratchet higher as more applications for AI join the mix.\nFinally, at just 24 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors an inexpensive way to profit from the AI revolution.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is indeed Warren Buffett's favorite Dow stock as his firm, Berkshire Hathaway owns 789,368 million of the company shares worth $135.361 billion as of the first quarter of 2024. However, we recently identified the best Dow stocks according to hedge funds, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) takes the 5th spot on our list of Best Dow Stocks. To view the number 1 Dow stock to buy now, go to 8 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOn May 17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed out at record highs, crossing the 40,000 milestone for the first time ever. However, this was a little shortlived as the index is down nearly 2.35% since that day, as of May 23. While the index seems to be underperforming the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, it doesn\u2019t fully cover the market conditions like the latter two. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ\u2019s performance is mostly dominated by mega-cap tech stocks, especially NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which isn\u2019t a part of the Dow Jones index.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported its first-quarter 2025 earnings on May 22. Despite record numbers, the market failed to rally along with the company. This includes the Dow Jones index as all 30 of its components ended the day in red on May 23, including some of the best Dow stocks that are direct AI beneficiaries such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nIn its Q1 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) generated a revenue of $26.04 billion, which was up over 262% year-over-year and surprised the consensus estimates by $1.45 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12, an over 460% increase year-over-year. Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10 for 1 split, which will take effect on June 7. For the second quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects a revenue of $28.0 billion. The company predicts that the automotive sector will emerge as the leading enterprise vertical within its Data Center division in the current year. At its Q1 2025 earnings call, the company\u2019s CFO, Colette Kress said:\n\u201cLeading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla\u2019s expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.\u201d\nAfter reporting stellar earnings, NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price crossed the $1000 mark for the first time and was 9.3% higher in a day, at the May 3 market close. Nevertheless, the company failed to rally the market with it as the S&P 500 was down almost 0.75% during the same period, the NASDAQ-composite recorded a decline of 0.4% and the Dow Jones index experienced its worst day in almost 14 months declining by over 1.5%.\nEven though the Dow Jones index is underperforming other indices in 2024, CNBC Mad Money host, Jim Cramer still believes in celebrating its 40,000 points milestone. On May 20, he urged the investors to appreciate the market's progress despite past downturns. Cramer emphasized that while the Dow does not fully represent the market like the S&P 500, it reflects a team effort across various sectors, which should have been demolished by the challenges they faced, such as the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes, inflation, and supply chain issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet they thrived. He acknowledged the potential for market declines but stressed the importance of recognizing the achievements of these stocks and companies over the years.\nCramer mentioned that he started as a summer associate in 1983 at Goldman Sachs when the Dow was just over 1000 points, the market was full of bears in multiple sectors but the stock market \u201cleft them behind.\u201d He added that the index going from 1000 to 40,000 shows the strength of these companies and that they \u201cwill make you money.\u201d\nIn light of these comments, some of the best Dow stocks include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). You can also take a look at the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a known developer and manufacturer of smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories.\nOn May 2, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced second-quarter earnings. The GAAP EPS was $1.53, which beat the market consensus by $0.03. The revenue topped the estimates by $190 million at $90.8 billion. Furthermore, the company announced an additional $110 billion program to repurchase its common stock.\nAt a stake value of $161.38 billion, 150 hedge funds held positions in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the first quarter. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is the top investor in the company and has a position worth $135.361 billion as of Q1.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has caught the attention of institutional investors as one of the best down stocks to buy. Other such stocks include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).\nThe London Company stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cReduced: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 Reduction reflects strong performance in 2023 and resulting elevated valuation. We believe the outlook for AAPL remains strong with slow growth in iPhone (now #1 global market share) and faster growth in the higher margin services business. R&D will continue to drive new products and AAPL now has over 2 billion installed devices around the world. While near term earnings expectations appear reasonable, we felt it was prudent to reduce the position size based on risks to valuation.\u201d\nApple Inc.

        "Author": "  Eric Sorensen, Ben Munson ",
        "Text": "Heineken is a huge multinational corporation and it\u2019s affected by market realities like supply and demand just like any other company. But when the answer to those issues is destroying an apple orchard, it\u2019s hard to see it as just business.\nHeineken owns Penrhos Orchard, a 300-acre site in Wales that was planted in 1997. The company said last year that it wants to sell that land because demand for cider has declined and left it with a \u201csurplus of apples.\u201d It said the apples grown in the orchard are bittersweet, meaning they have no use besides making cider. So Heineken, in line with the Wildlife Act, uprooted the entire orchard, which was the size of 140 football pitches (or soccer fields) and shredded all the wood for biomass.\nHow do you like them apples? Well, a lot of people don\u2019t like them at all.\nMost Read on IEN:\nReport: SpaceX Injuries Far Exceed Industry Average\nPODCAST: How to Sell Welding to Gen Z\nEPA Rule Bans Toxic Chemical Known to Cause Liver Cancer\nBoeing Company Expands to Make Parts for Stingrays, Red Hawks, Military Helicopters\nThe BBC spoke with ecologist Chris Formaggia, who said tearing up the orchard will have a big impact on wintering thrush species of birds who would use the orchard for shelter and foraging. WalesOnline rounded up comments from readers who blasted the move by Heineken, calling it a \u201chorrific act of violence\u201d and \u201cdisgusting behavior.\u201d\nHeineken defended its decision to chop down the apple trees and said it was \"incredibly important that we act responsibly and sustainably at all times.\" It also claimed that the amount of cider consumed in the UK has fallen by one-third in the past 10 years.\nHeineken owns cider brands including Bulmers, Strongbow and Orchard Thieves. The company reports its cider business results under the Beyond Beer tag, which also includes the company\u2019s ready-to-drink and wine options. Last week, the company said its Beyond Beer portfolio grew revenue by close to 10% during the first quarter, driven in part by a strong performance from Savanna, a cider brand it acquired as part of its tie-up with the Distell Group.\nThe UK is the world\u2019s biggest market for cider. The National Association of Cider Makers said UK cider represents 39% of the global market. So, any declines in that market would be especially felt by producers. And as the NACM pointed out, the amount of cider consumed has been steadily decreasing since 2009.\nStill, as Heineken is probably realizing, it\u2019s hard to chop down nearly half a square mile of apple trees and still have the public on your side.\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking manufacturing industry news.\n"

        "Title": "Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak was expelled from the school where he just delivered his commencement speech\u2014\u2019be leaders, not followers\u2019",
        "Author": "  Sunny Nagpaul ",
        "Text": "Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak was in high school the first time he left his home state of California. He was boarding a flight to Boulder to check out the University of Colorado campus with some friends.\nThe electronics prodigy had designed his first computer at age 13, and by the time he applied to colleges, he was a candidate for several of the country\u2019s top technology schools. But that first night in Boulder changed things for him. He saw snow for the first time and fell in love with the beauty and \u201cfreshness\u201d of the school.\nWozniak recalled the one year he spent at the school, from 1968 to 1969, in his Thursday commencement speech to the University of Colorado Boulder\u2019s class of 2024. He described going to his first concert (Simon and Garfunkel), and showing his fellow Apple cofounder Steve Jobs his favorite Bob Dylan records. Still, when \u201cI look at my yearbook from that year,\u201d he told students, it \u201cshows a lot of soldiers on this campus with assault rifles during the Vietnam War protests.\u201d\nIn his speech, Wozniak affirmed the importance of intellectual freedom through his own experiences as one of the country\u2019s most influential leaders of electronic innovation, citing the institutional and bureaucratic pushback on his own technological creations, and the military presence that had taken over the campus. Today, as more than 80 college encampments across the country protest the U.S.\u2019s financial support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, Wozniak\u2019s perspective comes at a time many are calling to protect academic freedom.\nAfter Wozniak visited Boulder for the first time, he said in the speech, \u201cI told my parents I would only apply to this one school, none of the others.\u201d They told him they only had enough money to afford one year of out-of-state tuition at the school, but told him to follow his heart. That freedom he experienced, he said, became invaluable advice to him.\n\u201cMy parents let me follow my heart,\u201d he said, \u201cSo I was careful to be that way with my own children; their choice is the most important.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing, though. Institutional pushback was prevalent in the computer labs he studied at.\n\u201cInstead of being praised here for some really good scientific programs I wrote, with the one huge massive computer down in the basement, I was demeaned because I ran my class five times over budget,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it boiled down to money and bureaucracy and that kind of stuff.\u201d\nTo be fair, Wozniak was expelled from the school after his first year for hacking into the school\u2019s network and sending prank messages. Still, he faced resistance even while developing innovative computer programs \u201cat a time when there were no books on the subject,\u201d he said.\nHe made a decision: \u201cI knew computers by heart. I decided I wanted a computer of my own that I could decide what to do with it.\u201d\nThe goal for that computer, he said, was to \u201chelp other human beings do more with their lives than they could do without a computer, and not to rely on million-dollar mainframes that companies and universities could afford.\u201d\nThat dream was soon realized. In 1976, Wozniak built out the first versions of Apple\u2019s personal computers, and the following year, the company released the Apple II, one of the earliest personal computers available to the general public, which was met with huge commercial success. In 1985, Wozniak left his role at Apple to find an engineering role that didn\u2019t also involve running a fast-growing business, selling much of his Apple stock upon his departure, according to Business Insider.\nSince then, Wozniak has leaned into the country\u2019s education system, spending eight years teaching fifth grade. He presented the graduating class with some advice he has collected from all of that experience: \u201cYou grow up in education to be leaders, not followers. Think for yourself and decide what\u2019s right and wrong.\u201d\nToday, as the country faces some of the biggest student protests since those that emerged during the Vietnam War, his words of advice have taken on deeper meaning. According to a tally by the Associated Press, since April 18 there have been at least 38 incidents of arrests made at campus protests across the country, with more than 1,600 people arrested at 30 schools.\nCollege campuses have been engulfed by student dissent following the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Southern Israel, which killed over 1,200 people, and Israel\u2019s response, a catastrophic military campaign which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, now entering its seventh month. Along with demands for divestment and financial transparency, protesting students also aim to show solidarity with millions of Palestinian civilians facing calamitous levels of disaster, including famine, disease outbreaks, and a children\u2019s crisis, in which at least a thousand children have lost limbs and over 19,000 children have been orphaned because of indiscriminate bombing in the war.\nAt Columbia University, for example, over 200 people were arrested in two police raids that occurred on April 18 and April 30, the latter of which, coincidentally, is the same day 700 students were arrested for protesting the divisive Vietnam War and Columbia\u2019s expansion into Harlem more than 50 years ago.\nArchon Fung, a professor of political science at Harvard, told Fortune there are important parallels between the protests, especially in terms of how university administrations respond to acts of civil disobedience. Civil disobedience \u201chas an important place in democracy,\u201d Fung said, adding, \u201ccivil disobedience is, by definition, breaking the rules.\u201d\nFor college students who will soon leave the walls of their campus to become the next generation of leaders, bosses, and entrepreneurs, Wozniak offers a modern twist on some old-school advice: \u201cyou all have AI\u2013actual intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cPay your own success forward,\u201d he implored students, \u201cand keep teaching and mentoring others.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Featuring a new thin and light design, breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display, and outrageously fast M4 performance with powerful AI capabilities, the new iPad Pro takes a huge leap forward\nCUPERTINO, Calif., May 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today unveiled the groundbreaking new iPad Pro\u00ae in a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability and performance to the next level. Available in silver and space black finishes, the new iPad Pro comes in two sizes: an expansive 13-inch model and a super-portable 11-inch model. Both sizes feature the world\u2019s most advanced display \u2014 a new breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR\u2122 display with state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology \u2014 providing a remarkable visual experience. The new iPad Pro is made possible with the new M4 chip, the next generation of Apple silicon, which delivers a huge leap in performance and capabilities. M4 features an entirely new display engine to enable the precision, color, and brightness of the Ultra Retina XDR display. With a new CPU, a next-generation GPU that builds upon the GPU architecture debuted on M3, and the most powerful Neural Engine yet, the new iPad Pro is an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence. The versatility and advanced capabilities of iPad Pro are also enhanced with all-new accessories. Apple Pencil Pro\u2122 brings powerful new interactions that take the pencil experience even further, and a new thinner, lighter Magic Keyboard\u00ae is packed with incredible features. The new iPad Pro, Apple Pencil Pro, and Magic Keyboard are available to order starting today, with availability in stores beginning Wednesday, May 15.\n\"iPad Pro empowers a broad set of pros and is perfect for anyone who wants the ultimate iPad experience \u2014 with its combination of the world\u2019s best displays, extraordinary performance of our latest M-series chips, and advanced accessories \u2014 all in a portable design. Today, we\u2019re taking it even further with the new, stunningly thin and light iPad Pro, our biggest update ever to iPad Pro,\" said John Ternus, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. \"With the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display, the next-level performance of M4, incredible AI capabilities, and support for the all-new Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, there\u2019s no device like the new iPad Pro.\"\nThinnest Apple Product Ever\nThe new iPad Pro \u2014 the thinnest Apple product ever \u2014 features a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability to a whole new level. The 11-inch model is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at a striking 5.1 mm, while both models are just as strong as the previous design. The 11-inch model weighs less than a pound, and the 13-inch model is nearly a quarter pound lighter than its predecessor \u2014 allowing pro users to extend their workflows in new ways and in more places. The new iPad Pro is available in two gorgeous finishes \u2014 silver and space black \u2014 both with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures.\nWorld\u2019s Most Advanced Display\nThe new iPad Pro debuts the Ultra Retina XDR, the world\u2019s most advanced display, to provide an even more remarkable visual experience. The Ultra Retina XDR display features state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness. The new iPad Pro supports an incredible 1000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak for HDR. No other device of its kind delivers this level of extreme dynamic range. Tandem OLED technology enables sub-millisecond control over the color and luminance of each pixel, taking XDR precision further than ever. Specular highlights in photos and video appear even brighter, and there\u2019s more detail in shadows and low light than ever before on iPad\u00ae \u2014 all while delivering even more responsiveness to content in motion. For pro users working in high-end, color-managed workflows or challenging lighting conditions, a new nano-texture glass option comes to iPad Pro for the first time.1 Nano-texture glass is precisely etched at a nanometer scale, maintaining image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light for reduced glare. With its breakthrough tandem OLED technology, extreme brightness, incredibly precise contrast, brilliant colors, and nano-texture glass option, the new Ultra Retina XDR display is the world\u2019s most advanced display, giving iPad Pro customers an unparalleled viewing experience.\nOnly Possible with M4\nThe incredibly thin and light design and game-changing display of the new iPad Pro is only possible with M4, the next generation of Apple silicon that delivers a huge leap in performance. M4 is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology that\u2019s even more power efficient, which is perfect for the design of the new iPad Pro. With an entirely new display engine, M4 introduces pioneering technology for the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the Ultra Retina XDR display. The new CPU offers up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores,2 with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators, to deliver up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over M2 in the previous-generation iPad Pro.3 M4 builds on the GPU architecture of M3 \u2014 the 10-core GPU includes powerful features like Dynamic Caching, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, which come to iPad for the first time. Coupled with higher unified memory bandwidth, pro rendering apps like Octane will see up to 4x faster performance than M2.3 M4 also delivers tremendous gains and industry-leading performance per watt. Compared to M2, M4 can deliver the same performance using just half the power, and compared to the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a quarter of the power.4 A new advanced Media Engine includes support for AV1 decode, providing more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.\nOutrageously Powerful Device for AI\nThe new iPad Pro with M4 features Apple\u2019s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of 38 trillion operations per second, which is 60x faster than Apple\u2019s first Neural Engine in the A11 Bionic chip. Combined with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, a high-performance GPU, more memory bandwidth, and intelligent features and powerful developer frameworks in iPadOS\u00ae, the Neural Engine makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for AI. With iPad Pro with M4, users can perform AI-enabled tasks even faster, like easily isolate a subject from its background in 4K video with just a tap with Scene Removal Mask in Final Cut Pro\u00ae. With this advanced level of performance, the Neural Engine in M4 is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\niPadOS also has advanced frameworks like Core ML\u00ae that make it easy for developers to tap into the Neural Engine to deliver phenomenal AI features locally, including running powerful diffusion and generative AI models, with great performance on device. iPad Pro also supports cloud-based solutions, enabling users to run powerful productivity and creative apps that tap into the power of AI, such as Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Adobe Firefly.\nPro Cameras\nThe updated camera system on the new iPad Pro delivers even more versatility, and with its rich audio from four studio-quality mics, users can shoot, edit, and share all on one device. The 12MP back camera captures vibrant Smart HDR images and video with even better color, improved textures, and detail in low light. It also now features a new adaptive True Tone\u00ae flash that makes document scanning on the new iPad Pro better than ever. Using AI, the new iPad Pro automatically identifies documents right in the Camera app, and if a shadow is in the way, it instantly takes multiple photos with the new adaptive flash, stitching the scan together for a dramatically better scan.\nOn the front, the TrueDepth\u00ae camera system moves to the landscape location on the new iPad Pro. The Ultra Wide 12MP camera with Center Stage\u00ae makes the experience of video conferencing in landscape orientation even better, especially when iPad is attached to a Magic Keyboard or Smart Folio\u00ae.\nPro Connectivity\niPad Pro includes a high-performance USB-C connector with support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4, delivering fast wired connectivity \u2014 up to 40Gb/s. Thunderbolt supports an extensive ecosystem of high-performance accessories, including external displays like the Pro Display XDR at its full 6K resolution, and external storage, all connected using high-performance cables and docks. iPad Pro supports Wi-Fi 6E for super-fast Wi-Fi connections for pro workflows on the go. Wi-Fi + Cellular models with 5G allow users to access their files, communicate with colleagues, and back up their data in a snap while on the go. Cellular models of the new iPad Pro are activated with eSIM, a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, allowing users to quickly connect and transfer their existing plans digitally, and store multiple cellular plans on a single device. Customers can easily get connected to wireless data plans on the new iPad Pro in over 190 countries and regions around the world without needing to get a physical SIM card from a local carrier.\nApple Pencil Pro\nApple Pencil Pro features even more magical capabilities and powerful new interactions that take the Apple Pencil\u00ae experience even further. A new sensor in the barrel can sense a user\u2019s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, use double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. A gyroscope allows users to roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they\u2019re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper. And with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark.\nWith these advanced features, Apple Pencil Pro allows users to bring their ideas to life in entirely new ways, and developers can also create their own custom interactions. Apple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My\u00ae for the first time to Apple Pencil, helping users locate Apple Pencil Pro if misplaced. It pairs, charges, and is stored on the side of iPad Pro through a new magnetic interface. iPad Pro also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at an incredible value.\nAll-New Magic Keyboard and Smart Folio\nDesigned for the new iPad Pro, an all-new thinner and lighter Magic Keyboard makes it more portable and versatile than ever. The new Magic Keyboard opens to the magical floating design that customers love, and now includes a function row for access to features like screen brightness and volume controls. It also has a gorgeous aluminum palm rest and larger trackpad that\u2019s even more responsive with haptic feedback, so the entire experience feels just like using a MacBook\u00ae. The new Magic Keyboard attaches magnetically, and the Smart Connector\u00ae immediately connects power and data without the need for Bluetooth. The machined aluminum hinge also includes a USB-C connector for charging. The new Magic Keyboard comes in two colors that perfectly complement the new iPad Pro: black with a space black aluminum palm rest, and white with a silver aluminum palm rest.\nThe new Smart Folio for iPad Pro attaches magnetically and now supports multiple viewing angles for greater flexibility. Available in black, white, and denim, it complements the colors of the new iPad Pro.\nPowerful iPadOS Features\niPadOS is packed with features that push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on iPad. With Reference Mode, iPadOS can precisely match color requirements of the Ultra Retina XDR display for tasks in which accurate colors and consistent image quality are critical \u2014 including review and approve, color grading, and compositing. Stage Manager\u00ae enables users to work with multiple overlapping windows in a single view, resize windows, tap to switch between apps, and more. With full external display support of up to 6K, iPad Pro users can also extend their workflow, as well as use the built-in camera on an external display for enhanced video conferencing. Users can take advantage of the powerful AI capabilities in iPad Pro and intelligent features in iPadOS, including Visual Look Up, Subject Lift, Live Text\u00ae, or Live Captions and Personal Voice for accessibility.\nWith iPadOS 17, users can customize the Lock Screen to make it more personal \u2014 taking advantage of the larger display on iPad \u2014 and interactive widgets take glanceable information further with the ability to get tasks done right in the moment with just a tap. The Notes app gives users new ways to organize, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs, and working with PDFs is also easier with AutoFill, which intelligently identifies and fills fields in forms.\nLogic Pro for iPad 2\nLogic Pro\u00ae for iPad 2, available starting Monday, May 13, introduces incredible studio assistant features that augment the music-making process and provide artists help right when they need it \u2014 all while ensuring they maintain full creative control. These features include Session Players, which expand on popular Drummer capabilities in Logic to include a new Bass Player and Keyboard Player; ChromaGlow\u2122, to instantly add warmth to tracks; and Stem Splitter, to extract and work with individual parts of a single audio recording.\nFinal Cut Pro for iPad 2\nFinal Cut Pro for iPad 2, available later this spring, introduces Live Multicam, a new feature that transforms iPad into a mobile production studio, allowing users to view and control up to four connected iPhone\u00ae and iPad devices wirelessly.5 To support Live Multicam, an all-new capture app also comes to iPad and iPhone, Final Cut Camera\u2122,6 giving users control over options like white balance, ISO, and shutter speed, along with monitoring tools like overexposure indicators and focus peaking. Final Cut Camera works as a standalone capture app or with Live Multicam. Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 also allows users to create or open projects from external storage, giving editors even more flexibility, and offers new content options.7\niPad Pro and the Environment\nThe new iPad Pro is designed with the environment in mind, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards.

Its shares closed above the $1,100 milestone for the first time ever.Last trading at $1,139, the AI chipmaker, the world\u2019s third-most valuable company, is now just $100 billion away in market value to overtake Apple AAPL in a major reshuffle of Wall Street's biggest players.

Investors cheered CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s comments regarding their latest chip, Blackwell, which is expected to be launched in the second half of the year.\nLast week, NVIDIA reported blowout first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein it topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled GPU chips. Its data center revenues skyrocketed 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion, buoyed by the rapid adoption of AI technologies (read: AI Boom Bolsters NVIDIA's Q1 Growth: ETFs to Tap).\nThe chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share. The stock split has sparked a retail frenzy as it will make NVIDIA shares more accessible to a wider range of investors, including the ones who make small trades, and increase liquidity.

        "Title": "Buffett says Berkshire in good hands, lauds Apple despite lowering stake",
        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing ",
        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing\nOMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) -Warren Buffett assured Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday that the executives expected to succeed him were ready for the job, and he heaped praise on Apple although Berkshire trimmed its position in the iPhone maker.\nSpeaking at Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting, the legendary investor paid tribute to his late business partner Charlie Munger and said he expected the conglomerate\u2019s cash pile, now a record $189 billion, to keep growing.\nThe meeting was the 60th for Buffett, who since 1965 transformed Berkshire from a failing textile company into an $862 billion colossus owning the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and dozens of other businesses.\nBuffett, 93, told shareholders that Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain have proven themselves the right people to lead Berkshire after he departs.\nAbel, who was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, and Jain have directly overseen Berkshire's operating subsidiaries since 2018.\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" Buffett said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\"I don't know quite how (Abel) does it, but we've got the right person, I can tell you that,\" he added.\nBuffett said he would want Abel, 61, upon becoming chief executive, to have final say on capital allocation decisions regarding Berkshire's portfolio of public stocks.\nInvestors had long considered Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who manage part of Berkshire's $335.9 billion equity portfolio, leading candidates to manage more or all of it.\nThe meeting, part of a weekend Buffett calls \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" was the first since Munger died in November at age 99. Buffett described Munger, his longtime his friend and foil, as the \"architect of today's Berkshire.\"\nBuffett gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\nDECREASING APPLE STAKE, GROWING CASH\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion.\nIn a surprise, Berkshire reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\nThe sale was the main reason Berkshire's cash hoard soared. Buffett said cash might grow to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks he sees from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\nDespite reducing the Apple stake, Buffett praised the company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest and largest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple comprised too much of Berkshire's equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain his company's biggest stock investment, barring unforeseen events.\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020. He described it as a substantial challenge, and said many claims were unfounded.\nShareholders reelected all 14 Berkshire directors, and rejected six shareholder proposals, all of which Buffett opposed.\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including scenes of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and clips of Buffett and Munger through the years.\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\nLINES FORMED HOURS BEFORE MEETING\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up in raw, rainy weather to enter the arena, sometimes several hours in advance. When the doors opened at 7 a.m., many ran for the best seats.\nThe weekend also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\nSerena Lam, 32, an investment manager who traveled with 40 others from Hong Kong, said she arrived at 2:30 a.m.\n\"I want to see Warren Buffett,\" she said. \"I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\nAs usual, Buffett interspersed comments on Berkshire's portfolio with musings about wealth and life, including his own.\n\u201cI enjoy managing money for the people who trust me. I like the feeling of being trusted,\" he said. \"If I'm lucky, I can go on for six or seven years, or it might end tomorrow.\"\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha; additional reporting by Scott Morgan in Omaha and Davide Barbuscia in New York; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia Osterman, Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n"

        "Text": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway grew its cash pile to a record $189 billion last quarter.\nBuffett's company added $21 billion to its stash of cash and Treasuries in three months.\nBerkshire slashed its Apple stake by about 13%, fueling $17 billion in sales of stocks.\nWarren Buffett's money mountain grew even larger last quarter as the billionaire struggled to find bargains with markets near record highs, and sold stocks at the fastest rate in years.\nThe famed investor's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stockpile of cash and Treasury bills by $21 billion to a record $189 billion \u2014 a 13% increase in just three months.\nBuffett's hulking conglomerate revealed that fact in its first-quarter earnings report, published just before the kick-off of its annual shareholder meeting, which has been dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\"\nThe centibillionaire and his team only spent $2.7 billion on stocks last quarter, while they dumped $20 billion worth, marking their largest quarterly disposal in several years. They offloaded over $17 billion of shares on a net basis.\nApple, Berkshire's number-one holding, made up \"substantially all of the sales,\" James Shanahan, a senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones, told Business Insider.\nThe stated value of Berkshire's stake fell from $174 billon at the end of December to $135 billion at the end of March, suggesting that Berkshire sold about 117 million Apple shares or 13% of its stake in the iPhone maker.\nBuffett confirmed the disposals during the shareholder meeting, but said he was virtually certain that Apple would still be Berkshire's top holding at the end of this year.\nHe appeared to rationalize the sale by noting that federal taxes are likely to rise in the years ahead as the government scrambles to service the ballooning national debt, meaning Berkshire will keep a greater share of its profits on Apple if it sells now rather than later.\n\"I don't think you'll mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he said.\nBerkshire's net stock sales totaled $24 billion in 2023, which was a big turnaround from its purchase of $34 billion of stocks on a net basis in 2022.\nOn the other hand, Buffett deployed $2.6 billion on stock buybacks last quarter \u2014 Berkshire's biggest quarterly outlay since he repurchased $4.4 billion worth of the company's stock in the first quarter of last year.\nBerkshire spent roughly $9 billion on buybacks last year, and just under $8 billion in 2022, down from over $24 billion in both 2020 and 2021.\nThe parent company of See's Candies, Geico, and NetJets grew its operating income by 39% year-on-year to $11.2 billion last quarter, as strong growth in its insurance and energy divisions offset lower earnings at the BNSF Railway.\nAnother major highlight was Pilot Travel Centers. The truck-stop chain, which Berkshire took full ownership of early last year, grew its revenues by 32% year-on-year to $12.5 billion for the period spanning February and March. However, its pre-tax earnings nearly halved to $70 million.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Title": "Some of the most talented, high-ranking workers at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX jumped ship after return-to-office mandates, new study reveals",
        "Author": "  Jane Thier ",
        "Text": "The focus of return-to-office discussions have long focused on the individuals. Why might workers prefer to stay home? Which age groups are most amenable to in-person work, and which are most combative? Does office collaboration make the most sense for creative types or heads-down numbers people? Can workers really be productive left to their own devices?\nYet the lingering question of how widespread remote work shapes company outcomes, as well as the wider sector landscape, largely remains unanswered because the whole experiment remains in flux. But a new working paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago, titled \u201cReturn to Office and the Tenure Distribution,\u201d comes fairly close to positing an answer: Return-to-office (RTO) mandates, when they\u2019re not wanted, are bad news for companies looking to keep their talent.\nThe researchers matched 260 million resumes to company data to analyze causal effects of RTO mandates on employees\u2019 tenure at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. In scientific terms, they found \u201ca reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure.\u201d In layman\u2019s terms: When the firms enacted RTO mandates, senior employees headed for the door\u2014often to direct competitors\u2014who let them work from home.\nThe number of top-brass employees at Microsoft\u2014as a share of the company headcount\u2014dropped by over 5% post-mandate; at Apple, it was 4%. (Microsoft mandated 50% of the week in-office; Apple, just one day a week.) SpaceX was the worst of the bunch, with a 15% drop, which the researchers chalk up to its uniquely stringent requirement: Five days a week in-person. That human outflow poses an enduring threat to \u201cproductivity, innovation, and competitiveness\u201d\u2014the component parts that separate a thriving company from one in freefall.\nMicrosoft\u2019s internal data doesn\u2019t align with the paper\u2019s findings, Amy Coleman, its vice president of human resources and corporate functions, told Fortune via email. The term \u201creturn to office mandate\u201d is also inaccurate, she said, adding that Microsoft is a hybrid workplace \u201cthat revolves around flexibility and a mix of workstyles across worksite, work location and work hours.\u201d In 2022, Microsoft\u2019s chief human resources officer Kathleen Hogan told Fortune the company considers \u201cworking from home up to 50% of the time as standard.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Apple and SpaceX did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment, though an Apple spokesperson told the Washington Post that the study drew \u201cinaccurate conclusions\u201d and \u201cdoes not reflect the realities\u201d of Apple\u2019s business or attrition rates.\nThe statistical analysis came from People Data Labs resum\u00e9 data, David Van Dijcke, a coauthor and University of Michigan economics PhD student, tells Fortune. \u201cThe takeaway is definitely that the effects [of RTO mandates] are more deleterious than people thought before.\u201d\nGranted, the study is far from all-encompassing; it only studied three major firms, and they were all \u201cearly movers\u201d in the RTO push, Van Dijcke acknowledges, pointing to each of their 2022 mandate announcements. That meant senior employees who left Microsoft, Apple, and SpaceX had \u201cpretty good outside options,\u201d namely competing companies that offered remote work with far fewer strings attached.\n\u201cIf we think of Covid as ending in 2022, that was certainly followed by an influx of people claiming they would leave\u2014and then really leaving when the first return-to-office mandates happened,\u201d Anthony Nyberg, a management professor at the University of South Carolina\u2019s Darla Moore School of Business, tells Fortune. \u201cApple and Microsoft really agonized over how to change their policies\u2014Amazon, too, made many public comments.\u201d\nTo be sure, Nyberg went on, mandating an office return is a major strategic decision\u2014and even in the Michigan study, which found a statistically significant portion of high-earning workers leaving, it remains unclear whether that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing for their former companies. \u201cA big part of this is likely to become a sorting effect in terms of talent finding their best-fit organizations,\u201d Nyberg says. \u201cAnd people going to competing companies has been a truism for all of eternity.\u201d\nPlus, especially within the tech industry, moving to a competitor that\u2019s offering to shell out more money is hardly much to write home about. Particularly if you work remotely, changing jobs is \u201cno more than getting a new laptop shipped to you,\u201d Nyberg says.\nA major asterisk to the data that Van Dijcke hopes people understand: Senior people may leave after a RTO more often, and in much greater numbers than entry- or mid-level workers, because senior leaders simply have more to gain. \u201cThey\u2019re older, they\u2019re more skilled, companies want to hire them for their expertise,\u201d Van Dijcke says; greener employees don\u2019t command the same sway. \u201cWe also saw that employees who leave aren't forced to accept suboptimal jobs\u2014demotions,\u201d he adds.\nEarlier literature shows a preference for fully remote jobs is lowest among the youngest employees, who have the most to gain from in-person collaborative work. \u201cThat seems to explain the pattern we observed\u2014that senior employees leave at higher rates,\u201d Van Dijcke says. \u201cThey have better options, and they also want to work from home more than junior employees do.\u201d\nEven so, no RTO mandate should come at the expense of the bottom line, Nyberg stresses. \u201cAs soon as an organization can no longer achieve its strategic directives, halt the RTO plan,\u201d he says. \u201cBut even during this period, these organizations keep enacting layoffs, which certainly suggests they\u2019re not in a people shortage yet. And layoffs are much more dangerous, broadly speaking.\u201d\nIndeed, layoffs, especially across Big Tech, often have long-term lagging effects, making workers likelier to leave due to disrupted culture and fractured trust. But mandates are pushing people out, too; poor morale might just be poor morale. (Ninety-nine percent of companies found a drop in employee satisfaction following their RTO mandate issuance, per a recent University of Pittsburgh study.)\nMany experts see the whole decision simply. \u201cAn organization is really hurting itself if it forces people to come back,\u201d Stephan Meier, chair of the Management Division at Columbia Business School, tells Fortune, adding he personally thinks the future will be hybrid. \u201cPeople are really motivated by having flexibility in how they organize their days. But a lot of leaders grew up in an in-office environment\u2014that was their way to control employees, that\u2019s how they thought the world worked, that\u2019s what worked for them and it\u2019s why they\u2019re on top.\u201d\nMandates, for the most part, miss the point; workers will come back on their own accord if they feel doing so would bring a material benefit\u2014or make it easier to deliver on their own work objectives.\nNonetheless, if a company is hellbent on having full offices\u2014even if that can only be accomplished by force\u2014Meier says \u201cnow is probably a better time [to enact a mandate] than two years ago,\u201d owing to the pressure of mass layoffs and dire economic uncertainty. But companies that roll out mandates, he stresses, are missing the point.\n\u201cBeing a leader means finding something that benefits everyone, and makes the firm run better,\u201d Meier says. And fears of depressed financial outcomes stemming from remote work are far overblown; underperformers existed long before the pandemic, and no change in work arrangements will necessarily create more of them. \u201cBefore quiet quitting, there was Microsoft solitaire\u2014a different way of phoning it in,\u201d Meier says.\nAll told, the findings in the report don\u2019t seem too egregious to Nyberg, the South Carolina professor, who\u2019s spent decades\u2014through financial crises and boom periods\u2014assessing the flow of human capital. \u201cBut then again, I\u2019m old.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-05-27, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.71. It's currently trading at a price of $189.98. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -22.01%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.43\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.47%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n83.43\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n72.28\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n155.71\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $137.30. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -38.37%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Huawei flagship store openings surge in China, signaling showdown with Apple",
        "Author": "  Josh Ye ",
        "Text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) \u2014 Huawei is revamping its retail strategy and aggressively opening flagship stores in China, with some just a stone's throw away from Apple shops, as it seeks to retake the premium electronics throne in the world's biggest smartphone market.\nSituated directly across from Apple's Shanghai flagship store, Huawei's recently renovated shop spans three floors of a famous heritage architecture building in the financial hub's busy shopping district and includes a coffee shop and a gym.\nHuawei opened four such stores in major Chinese cities between December and February, an aggressive marketing blitz by a company that had largely relied on licensed distributors and is rebounding from U.S. sanctions imposed in 2019 that had crippled its smartphone business for four years until it could source domestic replacement parts.\n\"The Huawei flagship store is very nice. It looks much brighter inside compared to the Apple Store across the street,\" said Amy Chen, a 27-year-old physiotherapist who visited the Shanghai store this week to switch to Huawei's top-end Pura 70 Ultra from the iPhone 15 Pro in hopes of better mobile reception.\nApple has 47 stores in mainland China. Huawei, which did not open a flagship store until 2019, now has 11 of them.\n\"I think they will open more than 20 of them. Then it will eventually catch up to Apple,\" said Ethan Qi, associate director at research firm Counterpoint.\nIt marks a stark contrast to 2021 when the company's licensed stores were shuttered across China due to product shortages caused by the U.S. sanctions.\nHuawei has since developed its own chips, introduced highly popular 5G-capable products and, according to sources, has started aggressively recruiting dealers in recent months.\n\"As Huawei now manages to ship in large quantities, given the good profit margin they could provide, (distributors) have become willing to purchase Huawei devices again,\" Qi said. \"Previously, many couldn't get stock and their 4G devices didn't sell well.\"\nHuawei has been actively bargaining with distributors, touting the above industry average profit margins of its phones and sometimes demanding exclusionary clauses to turn them into its exclusive partners, according to two industry sources.\nMore than 5,200 stores licensed to sell Huawei products sprang up through the first 10 months of 2023, with more than half of them in third and fourth-tier cities, according to market research firm GeoQ, helping Huawei expand its army of distribution partners nationwide.\nIts renewed marketing push poses a major challenge to Apple, which suffered a 6.6% plunge in iPhone sales in China to 10.8 million in the first quarter, according to IDC data. By contrast, Huawei boosted its smartphone shipments by 110% to 11.7 million in the first quarter and overtook Apple as the No.2 smartphone vendor in China.\nHuawei and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.\nPremium push \nLucas Zhong, an analyst at research firm Canalys, said Huawei had plans to build out its flagship stores since 2020 but the progress was slowed by the U.S. sanctions, which led to a much slower iteration of its high-end products.\nThere are still supply chain issues leading to shortages of specific models, but they are under much better control and the new phones are garnering good reviews. That means Huawei is now putting its focus squarely on selling premium products that compete with Apple, according to analysts.\nIts latest Pura 70 Ultra smartphone, for example, starts at 9,999 yuan ($1,300), matching the price tag of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, while Samsung and Xiaomi are keeping prices for their premium models lower amid soft market demand.\nHuawei's luxurious flagship stores display premium products ranging from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, televisions and even electric vehicles made in partnership with Chinese automakers.\n\"Huawei now has a long product line,\" Qi said. \"They need big demo areas\u2026 They will have to do it themselves because their distributors don't have the capability to rent such a massive area.\"\nThe push to build more of its own stores also underscores Huawei's heavy reliance on offline sales. Between 70% and 80% of Huawei's sales come from physical stores, while Apple sees about 40% of its sales coming from online, according to Toby Zhu, another analyst at Canalys.\n\"Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are all being affected (by Huawei's comeback),\" Zhu said, referring to other Chinese smartphone makers. \"But for now, the biggest impact has been on Apple.\"\nAnd the impact is beginning to be felt beyond mainland China.\nSimon Lam, owner of a popular smartphone shop named Trinity Electronics in Hong Kong, said more independent smartphone shops had started selling Huawei devices in recent months.\n\"Everybody is stocking up on some Huawei right now. Some more, some less,\" he said. \"People are willing to pay a lot of money for high-end Huawei, something other brands really can't compare with.\"\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jamie Freed)\n"

        "Text": "Investors in Apple, Inc AAPL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 21, 2024 $5.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Apple shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Apple is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer-Mini computer industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.31 per share to $1.33 per share in that period.\nGiven the way analysts feel about Apple right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nBank of America reiterated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock as their Top Pick, maintaining a price target of $230.\nIn particular, Wall Street giant analysts are bullish about Apple's transition from smartphones to \"IntelliPhones,\" predicting a significant multi-year upgrade cycle.\n\"We view the upcoming AI-enabled phones (IntelliPhones) to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle similar to the step function improvement driven by the introduction of smartphones,\" the note stated.\nBofA\u2019s team believes that with a vast installed base of over four billion smartphones, the adoption of AI-enabled IntelliPhones will surpass the rapid uptake seen with smartphones and 5G.\nIntelliPhones are expected to leverage advanced AI and machine learning for features such as superior personal assistance, language processing, health monitoring, enhanced photography, and AR/VR experiences, among other things.\nNeedham analysts on Thursday downgraded UiPath (NYSE:PATH) stock from Buy to Hold citing a mix of factors, including macroeconomic headwinds and a changing go-to-market (GTM) strategy.\n\"We downgrade PATH shares to Hold due to a combination of macro pressure, uncertainty around near-term execution due to a CEO change and a changing GTM strategy, and Y/Y margin compression creating an unfavorable near-term financial profile,\u201d analysts wrote.\nThe investment firm noted that the company's Q1F25 sales metrics were mildly disappointing, with large deals facing incremental scrutiny.\nThe recent CEO change back to founder Daniel Dines, following Rob Enslin's departure, and multiple GTM changes are expected to cause near-term sales disruptions.\nNet new annual recurring revenue (ARR) and revenue guidance were both lowered, which Needham believes is \u201cconservative enough, but we think it will take multiple quarters for the GTM changes to start driving meaningful upside to guidance.\u201d\nEnterprise AI firm C3.ai (NYSE:AI) saw its shares upgraded by Northland analysts during the week from Market Perform to Outperform, with a target price of $35.\nAnalysts highlighted the company\u2019s rising subscription growth in Q4 2024 as a key factor behind the upward revision.\n\"C3.ai posted accelerating subscription growth to 41% in 4Q24, providing evidence that the headwinds from a migration to a usage-based revenue model are abating,\" analysts commented.\nLooking forward, strong pilot expansion and demand for generative AI (genAI) signal continued high growth, they added.\nJapanese investment banking and securities firm Mizuho lifted its price targets on several chipmakers this week, including Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).\nThe move comes as Mizuho analysts believe the next catalyst for AI will be at the edge, as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) push AI on-device capabilities for handsets and PCs.\nThe firm reiterated Buy ratings, raising price targets to $240 for Micron, $155 for Qualcomm, $90 for Seagate, and $110 for Western Digital.\nAnalysts highlighted Qualcomm's ramp-up with AI PCs using Snapdragon X Elite and Plus, and the expected increase in AI smartphone shipments.\nMoreover, AI PCs, requiring 40% to 80% more DRAM, and handsets needing 50% to 100% more DRAM, present tailwinds for Micron. Western Digital and Micron are also expected to benefit from higher NAND content in AI devices with improved pricing.\nMeanwhile, Seagate stands out with higher storage content on PCs and increasing cloud capital expenditure. Mizuho forecasts 1 billion AI smartphones shipped from 2024 to 2027, with AI PCs comprising up to 60% of the PC market by 2027.\nIn a new note to clients, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated a Buy rating on Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) shares and lifted their price target from $125 to $185, emphasizing the IT company is \u201cprogressing as a legit GenAI participant.\u201d\n\"Dell continues to show legitimate GenAI progression the last 90 days which seemingly could progress through CY2025,\" Loop analysts stated.\nThe investment bank pointed out Dell's well-positioned stance for long-term commercial IT budget share, noting the company's expanding capabilities across infrastructure products, services, and financing.\nDell identified a $2 to $3 attach revenue opportunity in services, networking, and storage for every $1 of GenAI server revenue.\n\u201cOn storage specifically, there has been a suggestion in our work that for commercial (non-Hyperscale) Gen AI storage that after VAST Data & WEKA, DELL storage could be as well positioned as PSTG & NTAP, if not better positioned,\u201d analysts wrote.\nAnalysts also highlighted that Dell has pre-purchased over $7 billion in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, significantly boosting inventory in the last 90 days. Dell expects to secure $10 to $15 billion worth of GPUs over the next six quarters, aligning with its potential Generative AI revenue of $9 to $10 billion in 2024 and possibly $15 billion in 2025.\nCurrent guidance for Generative AI server revenue in 2024 is about $5 billion. Despite a slight decline in PC shipments and a 200 basis point drop in market share, Dell's core commercial market exposure is expected to grow in late 2024 and 2025.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple reiterated as Top Pick, C3.ai stock upgraded\nBoeing executives unlikely to be charged over 737 MAX crashes, source says\nDelaware judge lets more than 70,000 Zantac lawsuits go forward\n"

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Manali Pradhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. stock market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth over the past decade despite multiple economic challenges and geopolitical pressures. This environment has helped pave the way for high-growth companies such as Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft to reach the coveted trillion-dollar market capitalization.\nThese companies have demonstrated powerful and scalable business models, visionary management, and rapid organic and inorganic market expansion. Plus, these companies have quickly adopted technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing.\nOnly a few other companies share similar characteristics and may be next in line to cross the trillion-dollar market capitalization mark by 2030. Here's why Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) fits the bill and may soon join the trillion-dollar club.\nThe increasing demand for accelerated computing infrastructure and AI-driven data centers has been the major growth catalyst for Broadcom, especially for the networking business in the past couple of years. In fiscal 2024's first quarter, ended Feb. 4, Broadcom's AI revenue quadrupled year over year to $2.3 billion, offsetting the cyclical slowdown in other businesses. The company now expects AI-related revenue to account for almost 35% of its fiscal 2024 semiconductor revenue at $10 billion , up from its previous estimate of $8 billion.\nThis upward revision can be mainly attributed to the solid demand for its custom AI chips and networking solutions such as Tomahawk 5 800G switches, Ethernet, digital signal processing (DSP) platforms, and optical components by large-scale enterprises deploying AI data centers and hyperscale customers.\nBesides catering to enterprise AI demand, Broadcom's networking solutions are also used extensively in consumer-facing AI applications. In its fiscal Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted the strong demand for the company's custom AI chips at two hyperscalers .\nAlthough the company has not disclosed the names of these clients, many analysts have zeroed in on Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Since these clients own vast amounts of data and have a very large subscriber base, they stand to benefit dramatically from the use of custom AI chips in targeted areas such as search, SEO, and digital marketing. Since Broadcom seems to have cultivated deep, strategic, and multi-year relationships with these hyperscalers, it is well-positioned to develop custom AI chips catering to their specific needs.\nBroadcom has a proven track record of designing and manufacturing high-performance and energy-efficient custom AI chips as well as multiple AI-optimized networking components capable of handling complex workloads for foundational models and large language applications. Coupled with the company's long-term relationships with its clients and a supporting software ecosystem, Broadcom is poised to thwart competition from new players in the custom silicon space.\nThe acquisition of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions player VMware is also proving to be a major growth catalyst for Broadcom. In the first quarter, the company's infrastructure software revenue was up 153% year over year to $4.6 billion, with VMware contributing almost $2.1 billion during the 10.5 weeks of the quarter (as the acquisition was completed in November 2023).\nConsolidated software bookings grew nearly three times year over year to $1.8 billion in the first quarter and are expected to reach $3 billion in the second quarter. Broadcom expects revenue from the VMware portfolio to grow sequentially by a double-digit percentage every quarter throughout fiscal 2024.\nBroadcom's VMware strategy mainly involves upselling VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) to existing customers, especially those already running compute workloads with vSphere virtualization tools. VCF is a complete software stack, which includes computing, storage, and networking capabilities, and acts as an alternative and complement to the public cloud platforms for the customers' on-premise data centers.\nThe company is focusing on developing an improved VCF stack to sell to its largest 2,000 strategic customers, many of whom need a hybrid cloud solution (mix of private and public cloud infrastructure) for their on-premise distributed data centers. Broadcom has also partnered with Nvidia to form VMware Private AI Foundation, which enables VCF to run GPUs. This initiative is helping further drive demand for VCF.\nThe global virtualization software market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22.3% from $40 billion in 2023 to $300 billion in 2033. Broadcom seems well-poised to capitalize on this opportunity, thanks to the synergies between its software offerings and acquired VMware portfolio. The company expects its overall software revenue to be $20 billion in fiscal 2024, which will end Oct. 31.\nBroadcom's hardware and software offerings are used in multiple end markets including smartphones, telecommunications, and a variety of industrial applications. The diversified client base has made the overall business resilient since fluctuations in a few end markets can be partly offset by others.\nBroadcom shares are currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 16.6, significantly higher than their five-year average of 9.3. However, considering the company's ability to capitalize on the growing demand for accelerated computing and data center infrastructure across industries, this high valuation seems justified.\nThe company is poised to generate revenue of $50.2 billion in fiscal 2024. Assuming its P/S ratio remains constant (due to AI tailwinds), the company will have to grow its revenue to about $61 billion to support a $1 trillion market capitalization. This seems to be a very achievable target, since analysts are projecting Broadcom's revenue to grow to $62.8 billion by fiscal 2026.\nHence, it makes sense for long-term retail investors to consider buying at least a small stake in this AI-powered stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "This year already saw two new companies' market caps surpass $2 trillion, and a third is poised to hit that milestone.\nThe current members of the $2 trillion club are some of the most well-respected names in their fields, and all of their businesses revolve around technology.\nMicrosoft ($3 trillion) established itself as an AI leader with a smart investment in OpenAI. Its Azure cloud computing platform and enterprise software business reap the benefits.\nApple ($2.8 trillion) sells the iPhone and operates a growing services ecosystem built around its devices.\nNvidia ($2.2 trillion) sits at the forefront of the AI trend as a supplier of the most sought-after chips for large language model training.\nAlphabet ($2.1 trillion) owns the most popular search engine, Google, operating a massive advertising business, and one of the biggest cloud computing platforms in the market.\nThe next company likely to join them also heavily invested in tech, including cloud computing and digital advertising. But its core business, retail, also shows a ton of potential for earnings growth. That company is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\nThree important pieces of Amazon's business are benefiting from various trends. But investors shouldn't discount the operational excellence that Amazon's management team exhibited to take advantage of those trends.\nAmazon is a key player in the booming AI trend. As demand for generative AI capabilities expands, cloud computing segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) is building out its capabilities to meet that demand.\nCEO Andy Jassy says he likes to think of AI development in three layers. At the base layer, Amazon offers developers compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and its own custom Trainium 2 chips. It also offers a service, SageMaker, that makes training a large language model easier by managing customer training data. In the middle layer, it offers Amazon Bedrock for anyone looking to build on top of existing large language models. Developers can expand on existing models and build custom AI apps using Bedrock's tool set. At the top layer are existing AI-powered applications running on the cloud.\nAll three layers have contributed to the reacceleration of Amazon Web Services' revenue growth. The segment's revenue run rate surpassed $100 million in the first quarter.\nThe second trend is digital advertising. Despite how prevalent digital advertising is these days, it remains an opportunity for Amazon. The company saw great success with its sponsored product listings. In January, it started including video ads in Prime Video by default, adding another opportunity for sales growth. That said, management still says it thinks there are growth opportunities in its core display ad business.\nIts advertising revenue climbed 24% year over year last quarter, and exceeded $49 billion over the trailing 12 months.\nAmazon's original business, online retail, remains a big opportunity. Despite relatively slow growth for online store sales, third-party seller services, and subscription services (which mostly consists of Prime memberships), the real story is its expanding operating margin. North American operating margin climbed to 5.8% from 1.2% a year ago. That margin expansion was fueled by more efficient shipping operations as Amazon overhauled its logistics network. International operating income turned positive in the first quarter, a major milestone for the company.\nSmall improvements in operating margin go a long way when a business generates $500 billion per year in revenue.\nAs of this writing, Amazon's market cap sits just shy of $2 trillion. The stock needs to gain just 3% for the company to reach that milestone, and that could happen any day. Given the significant trends lifting its business and its operational successes, it shouldn't take long for the market to push it over the top.\nThat's especially true considering that the stock trades at a fair valuation. Its enterprise-value-to-sales ratio is 3.2, and analysts on average expect 11% sales growth both this year and next year. But with the expanding operating margin, it should produce earnings and free cash flow growth that far exceeds its revenue growth. And its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of about 40 looks downright cheap compared to Amazon's historic levels.\nAt its current price, Amazon has an opportunity to surpass a $2 trillion valuation and never look back.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $559,743!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "SINGAPORE / ACCESSWIRE / May 9, 2024 / DeBox, a top-tier web3 based crypto-social platform, has unleashed unprecedented user growth rates exceeding 1,000% in the span of just a few months.\nWith the latest developments, DeBox surpasses 10 million users, setting a new benchmark to securing a top spot in Korean Apple Stores. The platform's users are also growing at an astonishing rate. With the simple steps of \"free\" and \"wallet login\", DeBox has become the first stop for new users to experience crypto-socialization, and in less than half a year, the number of users has increased from 1.1 million to nearly 10 million, and the number of active users has increased from 20,000 to more than 800,000, even topping the leading spot in the Korean Apple Store.\nAt DeBox, with the influx of thousands of different crypto communities, especially those at the head of the Bitcoin ecosystem such as Sats and Bitcoin frogs, new users who were first introduced to crypto through the Inscription and Rune craze began to use DeBox as one of their go-to programs, making DeBox leading winners in the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. With the new generation officially entering the crypto world, DeBox is emerging as a new option for them. These young people are in desperate need of a community where they can connect.\nAnalyzing DeBox's website traffic sources, emerging regions such as Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Nigeria occupy the top five, and in the top ten, except for the United States, all visitors are from Asia, Africa and Latin America. Free\" & \"Simple\" is the perfect growth tool for DeBox. It takes only one click to create a wallet address and log into DeBox, the whole process takes less than 3 seconds to access the latest information in the crypto world, which is very attractive to young crypto enthusiasts living in the third world.\nIn addition, DeBox has also seen a growth in both trading volume and user base after the launch of its built-in universal trading marketplace with dex. DeBox offers easy sharing options for trading, which allows users to share a trade to groups or tweets, which brings a whole new entry point for trading. The deep combination of socializing and trading has also greatly unleashed the potential of cryptocurrencies in their native form.\n1. Potential for large-scale growth\nCrypto social is perhaps the most likely track in the crypto space to be the first to achieve massive adoption, the rapid growth of DeBox by more than 10x so far this year proves the huge potential and opportunity of crypto social, perhaps the first billion users crypto apps will appear in crypto social.\n2. Convergence of social and trading\nCrypto socialization is expected to become the new entrance to crypto trading. Through the deep integration of social and trading, users can buy cryptocurrencies or NFTs without thresholds in any scenario, a model that will most likely change the way traditional crypto operates and become a third-generation exchange.\n3. Security and compliance challenges\nAs more users begin to utilize these applications, ensuring data security and compliance with regulations becomes critical. Crypto social Apps need to continually improve security measures to ensure compliance.\nFurthermore, DeBox has experienced a rapid growth, even successfully topped the Apple Store, demonstrating the potential of crypto social software in the future. It provides users with a new social and trading experience as well as promotes the application of blockchain technology in daily life. In the future, crypto-social software could become an important force driving the digital economy, providing users with more autonomy and a better experience. As blockchain technology continues to evolve and gain popularity, crypto-social software is expected to make breakthroughs in a variety of areas and become a key component of the next generation of social media and business applications.\nAbout Debox:\nDebox is an on-chain holding community.

Future releases will support MacOS, and iPadOS.\nV5G enables 5G service on any generation phone, on any network, any provider and now, any Smartphone platform operating system.\nInitially engineered to run on Android, Virtual 5G service delivered through V5GE is now available on Apple platforms. V5GE is already in Global pre-GA (General Availability) release through the Apple Developer Program.\nApple \nAfter not being in the Top 10 for years, Apple briefly became #1 in the world in Smartphone sales in terms of units shipped, currently holding #2 (1st Quarter 2024). Given this increase in market share, Virtual Internet determined it is the right time to extend the V5G Global Network to Apple users.\niOS\nThe iPhone is Apple's largest selling product. Apple (non-Android Phones) comprise 20% \u00b1 of the global market and approximately 80% of the World is on Android.\nThe selection of iOS as the initial support for Apple was made because Apple is engineering macOS and iPadOS to be closer in both look and operation to iOS.\n5G service is a function of the network, not just the phone. New iPhones typically focus on features (e.g. cameras) that are specific to the device. This is why it is an opportune moment for iPhone users to have access to the Worlds Leading 5G Global Enhanced Mobile Broadband Network.\nCar Play and Android Auto\nV5G has already been engineered to work on Android Auto. Apple Car Play has been similarly designed to work as an option alongside Android Auto in automobiles. V5GE is purposefully designed to provide enhanced service over Apple, a service that devices makers and Smartphone Operating systems by themselves cannot deliver.\nWith Net Neutrality (ISPs cannot provide service enhancement for specific sites or services) \u00a0now a global policy, practice and unintentional reality, Virtual Internet's Global 5G Service is uniquely able to provide enhanced service delivery for partner Apps, distribution partners, and for Virtual Internet App Users.\nAbout Virtual Internet Pte. Ltd.\nVirtual Internet is an advanced technology company, incorporated in Singapore. Virtual Internet is building a new community of millions of users, connected through multiple networks. Virtual Internet has created and operates on its own Virtual 5G, Virtual 5GE Global Overlay Network, which allows millions of other applications and services to be delivered over 5G Mobile Broadband Speeds using existing Cellular Radio, Wi-Fi, and SATCOM networks.\nCONTACT: pr@adaranetworks.com\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/virtual-internet-announces-virtual-5g-for-the-apple-platform-302132555.html\nSOURCE Virtual Internet Pte.

        "Title": "The Art of Valuation: Discovering Apple Inc's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA.\nAs of 2024-05-13, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.71. It's currently trading at a price of $183.05. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -17.56%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.43\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.49%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n83.43\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n72.28\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n155.71\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $137.30. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -33.32%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 13, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average emerged stronger than the other two major indices in the latest market rally, driven by renewed hopes of rate cuts, solid corporate earnings and increased stock buybacks. The blue-chip index gained for seven consecutive days, marking its longest winning streak this year.\nWhile 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, we have highlighted five of them that have been leading the way higher. These are Amgen, Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Boeing and The Goldman Sachs Group.\nThe outperformance came as the market\u2019s rally broadened out. If this trend lasts, the Dow could continue its upward trajectory this summer.\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is finally paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\nThe blue-chip index also benefited from Apple\u2019s robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The iPhone manufacturer spread strong optimism after lifting its dividend payments and announcing a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales.\nAnother big mover in the index is Amgen, which surged more than 14% last week on a solid earnings report and encouraging test results of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. Bank stocks and small-cap stocks also showed an upward trend in recent sessions, powering the blue-chip index.\nFurther, the index appears unaffected compared with the other two major indices, which cooled down somewhat in the recent sessions following the latest Fed official comments that higher rates will likely stay for some time.\nAmgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience markets. The stock has risen 14.5% so far this month.\nAmgen saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3%. It has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It jumped nearly 9% over the past seven days and saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for this year in the same time frame.\nAMZN is expected to see earnings growth of 56.5% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nApple designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories worldwide. The company offers iPhone, a line of smartphones, Mac, a line of personal computers, iPad, a line of multi-purpose tablets, and wearables, home, and accessories comprising AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products and HomePod. Shares of AAPL are up 8% so far this month.\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past seven days for the fiscal year (ending September 2024) with an estimated earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.\nBoeing has been the premier manufacturer of commercial jetliners for decades. The company\u2019s premier jet aircraft along with varied defense products position it as one of the largest defense contractors in the United States. It has a solid estimated earnings growth of 95.9% for this year.\nBoeing has risen 8% so far this month. It has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nGoldman is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. It has risen 6.8% so far this month.\nGoldman saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 71 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 60.8%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 currently.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Solana Wallet Phantom Surges to Third Place on Apple App Store\u2019s Utility Category",
        "Author": "  Hope C ",
        "Text": "Phantom Wallet, a popular cryptocurrency wallet, has recently climbed to the third position in the utility category on the Apple App Store. This upward trajectory has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts who believe it could be a positive sign for the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. Phantom Wallet was initially launched as a wallet exclusively for Solana, before expanding to Ethereum, Polygon and Bitcoin. It is currently only trailing behind Google and Google Chrome Apps in the utility category.\nPhantom Wallet's rise in popularity aligns with its recent achievement of reaching seven million monthly active users, as announced in an April 29 post on X. In the crypto community, an increase in user numbers for a wallet application is typically interpreted as a sign of broader adoption.\nIt's important to note that an app's ranking on the app store is influenced by multiple factors beyond download numbers. For instance, MetaMask holds the 75th position in the same category, despite reporting 10 million monthly active users as of February 2024. Rankings also consider factors like monthly uninstalls, in-app transactions, and user reviews.\nPhantom Wallet's popularity stems from its self-custodial nature, allowing users to retain control over their keys. This offers an alternative to storing assets on exchanges, likely influenced by the well-publicized collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, prompting individuals to seek alternative storage options for their cryptocurrencies.\nSOL is currently trading at $177.72, marking a 23.23% increase over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap.\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 9, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \" The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 440 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week\u2019s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nTotal earnings for the 440 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +5.0% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.0% beating EPS estimates and 60.9% beating revenue estimates.\nThe earnings and revenue growth pace for these 440 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods. The +5% earnings growth pace improves to +11.9% once the Energy sector and Bristol Myers\u2019s one-time charge are accounted for.\nFor 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.2% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. Estimates have been increasing since the start of April, with the current +9.2% earnings growth pace up from +8.7% on April 3rd.\nLooking at the calendar year picture, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow by +8.9% this year after last year\u2019s modest decline. Excluding the hefty Tech sector contribution, whose 2024 earnings are expected to be up +15.9%, earnings for the rest of the index would be up only +6.3%.\nWe have consistently flagged signs of improvement in the overall revisions trend in recent weeks, with estimates starting to go modestly up. We are seeing this trend for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as for full-year 2024 estimates.\nThis new development has roughly coincided with the start of the Q1 earnings season. That said, several sectors, including Tech and Retail, had already been enjoying positive estimate revisions for quite some time. At present, half of the 16 Zacks sectors have higher aggregate earnings estimates than expected at the start of the year.\nWe have recently highlighted the favorable revisions trend for the Energy sector in this space. This week, we will discuss the evolving earnings outlook for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks.\nPlease note that the $443.9 billion the group is currently expected to earn in 2024 is up from $438.1 billion last week and $428.2 billion the week prior to that.\nWe all know that the revisions trend for Tesla TSLA has been negative for a while now, while the same for Apple AAPL is also negative, though the magnitude of negative revisions for Apple is far less severe.\nThe revisions trend for the remaining five members of this group is positive enough to more than offset the Tesla and Apple effects. Of these five, Nvidia NVDA is in a league of its own.\nA big part of this year\u2019s earnings growth is expected to come from margins reversing last year\u2019s declines and starting to expand again. The expectation is that aggregate net margins this year get back to the 2022 level, with the Tech sector driving most of the gains.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "This Buffett Investment Is Brilliant. (Hint: It's Not Apple, Chubb, nor Occidental Petroleum)",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Over the last several weeks, companies have been reporting earnings for the first quarter of 2024. Considering both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are notching record highs, investors have been keen to assess the progress of the hottest themes in the market. Artificial intelligence (AI), new breakthrough medications in the pharmaceutical industry, and a red-hot energy sector are all fueling buying activity in the market.\nIt's easy to get lost among the euphoria and hoopla driving the market right now. However, I'd encourage investors to take a step back and look at what others on Wall Street are doing.\nWarren Buffett's portfolio is often a good place to start. Since 1965, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) has returned 4,384,748%. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire held $189 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. With so much capital at its disposal and ripe stock market conditions, where might Buffett be looking for value?\nAs usual, the Oracle of Omaha left some clues in his latest shareholder letter. Let's explore where Buffett is aggressively investing his money and assess why this might be a good strategy for you, too.\nBuffett is a rare breed. His long-term success, coupled with his seemingly simple strategy, has earned admiration from investors all over the world. When Buffett buys or sells a stock, his moves have the power to shake the market considerably.\nDuring the first quarter, Buffett made some notable changes to his portfolio. For starters, he trimmed his stake in Apple by nearly 13%. While Apple remains Berkshire's largest position by a considerable margin, there was some initial shock from the sale.\nIn addition to Apple, Buffett also sold stock in Sirius XM, Paramount, Louisiana-Pacific, and Chevron. Buffett added to only one existing position: Occidental Petroleum. Moreover, he finally revealed a new position in insurance company Chubb.\nAll things considered, I'd say most of Buffett's moves during the first quarter were pretty mundane. But the cash pile is interesting.\nAt the end of the first quarter, Berkshire held $35.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In addition, the company also boasted $153 billion of short-term investments.\nWhat exactly does this mean?\nIn short, Buffett has been buying up Treasury bills. Given how strong the stock market has been across different sectors, this move might seem perplexing. However, in Berkshire's first-quarter report, management declared, \"We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.\"\nRemember, Buffett is a contrarian investor. Sure, the markets are showing some real strength right now, but inflation has remained stubbornly high, adding an extra layer of complexity when assessing the state of the economy. Despite several growth opportunities available right now, Buffett is not known to follow tailwinds or chase lofty valuations.\nAs always, Buffett is playing the long game, and his decision to buy Treasury bills is a classic feature of his overall strategy.\nConsidering the current three-month Treasury bill rate of 5.3% is the highest it's been in nearly 20 years, combined with the backing of the U.S. government, pouring cash into these bonds looks genius.\nWith so much unpredictability surrounding the macroeconomy, I think Buffett's choice to roll over Treasury bills every 90 days is wise. While there are ample opportunities to uncover lucrative growth, many stocks and industries still remain highly volatile right now. Furthermore, I don't see the market volatility subsiding anytime soon. For these reasons, I wouldn't be surprised to see Buffett continuing to double down on Treasuries for the time being.\nIf you're an investor who is looking for a steady, reliable way to bolster your cash, then following Buffett's lead into the Treasury bond market might just be for you.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $697,878!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.
