        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the few companies worldwide to have gone over the $3 trillion mark. It has made fortunes for its founders and early investors, but it can also put money in your pocket. The most obvious way to earn money from investing in Apple is through capital appreciation, but it does pay a modest dividend. However, be warned: It will take a lot of Apple stock to put any dividend income in your pocket.\nApple Inc.\u2019s 52-week price range was $164.08 to $237.23. Its dividend yield is 0.43%. It paid $0.96 in dividends during the past year. As of this writing, the stock has risen 20% over the past year and over the past five years by over 340%. That's not too shabby for a company of its size.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nThis property type is nearly recession-proof \u2014 see passive income real estate deals for accredited investors.\nThe CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY.\nOne theory of investing says that when a big company starts paying dividends, its best years may be behind it. We don't subscribe to that theory, but the market is waiting for Apple to build on its reputation for innovation. The most recent iterations of the iPhone have attracted sales but not the fan frenzy that earlier launches generated. During the most recent quarter, iPhone sales dropped by 10%. The Apple Watch is popular but hasn't become a must-have device to the same level as the iPhone.\nSome company watchers say that Apple has too much riding on the Vision Pro, which has a steep price tag and hasn't taken off the way many betting on virtual reality would have expected. Apple recently announced a new lineup of immersive videos and movies made specifically for the Vision Pro. We can expect to hear much more about the Vision Pro from CEO Tim Cook at the next earnings call on August 1.\nOne area where Apple is seeing growth is in its services area. Apple is bringing more content to its entertainment offerings, including live sports. We could also see it delve more deeply into artificial intelligence. While skeptics say Apple is too late to the generative AI party, its advantage is that it owns the devices that most of us use to interact with AI. Apple has the potential to surprise the world, but missteps, like a foray into self-driving cars, are cause for concern.\nCheck It Out: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\nLet's get back to the money. If you want consistent $500\u00a0 income from Apple, the bad news is you already need to have achieved millionaire status. To earn $500 per month \u2014 $6,000 annually \u2014 from Apple\u2019s dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $1,395,349, which is 6,222 shares at $224.27 each. Alternatively, to earn $100 per month, your investment value drops to $279,070 or 1,244 shares.\nHere's how to do the dividend yield calculations: When making an estimate, you need two key variables \u2014 the desired annual income ($6,000) and the dividend yield (0.43% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0043 = $1,395,349 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0043 = $279,070 for $100 per month.\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock\u2019s current price. For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as a yearly dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\nInvesting in Apple Inc. can provide a stable monthly income, but you'd have to outlay significant cash that might be better deployed across multiple opportunities. While Apple has performed very well as a stock, past performance doesn't mean the company can deliver again. It\u2019s important to consider market volatility and the potential for dividend changes. And we never like to have our eggs all in one basket; exploring ETFs, bonds,\u00a0 mutual funds, and private investing opportunities can offer diversified income streams with potentially lower risks.\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over 2 years starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "Text": "Apple customers are famously loyal\u2014but it turns out they\u2019re also slow to upgrade.\nA just-released Bank of America survey of over a million iPhone users from the U.S., the U.K., India, and China found that most of them have old phones. Some 29% of users own an iPhone from the iPhone 13 family, which came out in September 2021, while 13% own an iPhone from the iPhone 12 family, which came out in October 2020, and 31% own an iPhone that\u2019s even older than that.\nPut differently, less than a quarter of iPhone users bought their devices within the past three years\u2014bad news for the company\u2019s flagship product.\nWith iPhone demand falling over 10% in the first quarter of this year to a six-year low, tech experts and Wall Street analysts have criticized Apple for not giving users a reason to upgrade their old phones, and for lagging behind peers when it comes to new hardware and software offerings.\niPhone sales are critical for Apple, accounting for more than 50% of the company\u2019s revenue in the second quarter. But Bank of America analysts say that iPhone users' aging phones could signal opportunity for Apple stock.\n\u201cWe are raising our [price target] on Apple to $256 (from $230) on increased confidence of a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by an aging installed base and GenAI features that should provide a boost to customers' intentions to upgrade,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a Thursday note to clients. Apple shares currently trade around $232, implying a potential 12-month return of just over 10% for investors if BofA\u2019s price target proves prescient.\nThis new bullish report from BofA comes after its analysts argued in May that Apple will slowly turn its iPhones into AI-enabled \"intelliphones\" with more processing power and new applications, forcing customers to upgrade. The following month, Apple revealed a few key features at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) that they hope will convince customers to buy new phones, including a new-and-improved version of Siri that will use AI tech called Apple Intelligence.\nPerhaps in response to complaints about its lagging hardware development, Apple also announced it will release a slimmed-down version of its iPhone next year in June, and reports indicate a flip phone similar to those offered by Samsung may also be coming soon.\nBeyond the coming rollout of new AI software features and hardware upgrades, Wamsi and his team pointed to Apple\u2019s steady customer loyalty as key to their bullish outlook.\nThe analysts\u2019 survey of Apple customers showed 58% of current iPhone users intend on buying another iPhone when they upgrade their current device, compared to just 53% for Samsung, 38% for Huawei, and 31% for Xiaomi.\nWamsi and his team argued that there could be strong demand for upgrades among wearable tech users as well. When smartwatch owners were asked which device they plan to buy when they upgrade, the Apple Watch was far and away the most mentioned option.\nSome 66% of Indian smartwatch users who plan to upgrade say they will buy an Apple Watch, compared to 59% in China, 57% in the U.S., and 41% in the U.K.\nSimilarly, BofA\u2019s analysts found consumers are more willing to buy the Apple Vision Pro than previously expected, despite its hefty price tag. Some 14% of respondents in the U.S. reported that they are planning on buying the Apple Vision Pro, compared to 20% in China, 36% in India, and 8% in the U.K. BofA\u2019s analysts said they view these as high percentages, noting they\u2019re all well above the February survey figures.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

The agreement includes rules about scheduling, severance, and sub-contracting, and requires that any discipline not be \u201carbitrary, capricious or without merit,\u201d an IAM spokesperson said. The three-year deal will increase pay by an average of 10% and maintains the status quo on healthcare, retirement, and staffing, according to the union.\nThe Maryland store is one of two unionized sites among Apple\u2019s roughly 270 US locations. Both were organized in 2022, and since then contract talks have also been underway at an Oklahoma City store that unionized with the Communications Workers of America.\nBoth IAM and CWA have been attempting to expand their footholds to other Apple locations around the country, but efforts have so far come up short. Employees\u2019 assessments of what their peers in Maryland won in their contract talks could either ignite or subdue interest in organizing other stores.\nIn an emailed statement, the IAM\u2019s negotiating committee said it planned to \u201cbuild on this success in store after store and grow the power\u201d it created at the Towson, Maryland site. \u201cWe are giving our members a voice in their futures and a strong first step toward further gains.\u201d\nIn May, employees at the Towson store voted to authorize a potential strike, accusing the company of refusing to fairly negotiate.\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the deal. The company has said it was committed to engaging with the union \u201crespectfully and in good faith.\u201d\nIn the ongoing Oklahoma contract talks, only a few issues remain outstanding, according to employee Michael Forsythe, a member of CWA\u2019s bargaining committee. \u201cWe view the news of Towson\u2019s contract as a very positive thing for us,\u201d Forsythe said in a text message.\nApple is one of many prominent workplaces where unions have scored landmark US organizing victories since the start of the pandemic, including Microsoft Corp.\u2019s gaming studios, an Amazon.com Inc. warehouse, a Volkswagen AG plant, a Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. restaurant, and hundreds of Starbucks Corp. cafes.\nMost of those unions have yet to reach collective bargaining agreements.\n(Updates with union and company comment starting in second paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\nInside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\nScammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta\u2019s Own Tools\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release earnings results for its third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Aug. 1.\nMeanwhile, some investors are eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company currently has a dividend yield of 0.45%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents a share ($1.00 a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple's $1.00 dividend: $6,000 / $1.00 \u00a0= 6,000 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,332,480 worth of Apple, or 6,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares, or $266,496 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nView more earnings on AAPL\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple rose 1.5% to close at $222.08 on Wednesday.\nAnalysts expect Apple to report quarterly earnings at $1.35 per share, up from $1.18 per share in the year-ago period. The company is projected to post revenue of $84.53 billion, compared to $76.41 billion a year earlier.\nOn Thursday, analysts will also be looking at Apple\u2019s streaming results and its ability to balance ad-free plans with\u00a0ad-supported plans. Apple is one of the newer companies in the streaming space and could soon be launching an ad-supported plan.\nRead Next: \nJim Cramer Says This Home Improvement Chain Is A Buy Ahead Of Fed Rate Cut Cycle: \u2018I Would Pick Some Up Tomorrow\u2019\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Title": "At last, Apple's Messages app will support RCS and scheduling texts",
        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "The biggest updates coming to Apple's iMessage and its Messages app in iOS 18 aren't its AI emoji, Genmoji, or even the ability to send texts via satellite. It's the ability to finally, finally schedule messages to send at a later date and time, as well as support for RCS, the next-gen messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will make texting with Android folks much less painful. These updates are now available in iOS 18's public beta, which just opened up this week.\nThough buried amid a slate of AI announcements and other user interface tweaks at WWDC 2024, these messaging features will have a significant impact on how people communicate every day.\nFor years, consumer demand for scheduling messages has led developers to create complicated and cumbersome workarounds, like apps that remind you via push notifications to send a text, for example, or solutions that only worked on jailbroken iPhones. The new iOS will offer the ability to schedule your messages to be sent later as built-in functionality.\nThe feature only got a brief mention at WWDC. In Apple's press release, it was announced in the same sentence as the Tapbacks upgrade, which has expanded to include support for any emoji or sticker in iOS 18. Clearly, Apple doesn't think \"Send Later\" is a feature worth spending much time on. But for anyone who runs a business from their iPhone -- or people who only remember the important things they need to text while laying in bed at 3 a.m. -- the new scheduling feature will be a much-welcomed addition. Beyond simply making life easier, like when you want to text someone across time zones without disturbing them, Apple's screenshot suggests you could also use the feature to ensure you don't miss sending someone a birthday greeting.\nOf even greater importance, however, is the Messages app's support for RCS, the messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will address many of the grievances of texting those Android users with a green bubble.\nFor a long time, Google has urged and campaigned for Apple to adopt the standard, which would improve the communication experience between Android and iOS users. The Wall Street Journal ran a report on the fight over the green bubbles and how blue bubbles are a must-have for U.S. teens. While EU regulators ultimately decided that iMessage was not popular enough to be forced to open up and become interoperable with other messaging services, the additional scrutiny likely influenced Apple's decision here -- as did U.S. lawmakers' interest in Apple's shutdown of Beeper, a third-party app that brought iMessage to Android users.\nBecause of Apple's longtime refusal to add support for RCS, texting with Android users meant no typing indicators or read receipts, broken group chats and blurry photos and videos. It also meant that messages would not be end-to-end encrypted as they were on iMessage.\nUnfortunately for Android users, Messages sent via RCS won't be relieved of the green bubble curse on Apple devices according to screenshots on its website, which show the feature in action. Instead, the text box indicates in a light gray font that your texts with someone support both \"Text message + RCS,\" while the texts themselves are still green.\nHowever, issues that make the Messages app a broken experience for Apple's customers will be addressed, it seems, as Apple says it will support the standard later this year. The news, of course, only got a brief mention in Apple's press release, where it noted that RCS would allow for \"richer media and more reliable group messaging compared to SMS and MMS.\"\nEarlier reports indicated Apple intends to work with the GSMA to add support for end-to-end encryption in the Universal Profile for RCS, but won't support E2EE out of the gate. That's likely why there was no mention of encrypted messaging in Apple's announcement of RCS.\nThis story was originally published June 11 and was updated to reflect that the iOS 18 public beta is live.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/at-last-apples-messages-app-will-support-rcs-and-scheduling-texts/\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the consequences of the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump and mentioned a few stocks that could benefit if the former President comes to power again.\n\u201cYou are sticking your head in the sand if you think nothing has changed after the failed assassination attempt on the now-official Republican nominee for President.\u201d\nCramer said that the \u201cfrightening moments\u201d of the assassination attempt have indeed \u201ccut in the favor\u201d of Trump\u2019s win and he was \u201calready leading in the polls.\u201d\nCramer recalled the days when he was the anchor of Kudlow & Cramer show and Biden was a senator from Delaware. Cramer said Biden once told him that he was the \u201cpoorest senator out of one hundred because he owned no stocks.\u201d\n\u201cHe was actually bragging about it,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer said that Joe Biden is not the \u201cchampion\u201d of stocks and he\u2019s \u201con board with labor.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what Cramer said about Trump:\n\u201cIn the many years I\u2019ve known Trump and I have known him fairly well, he\u2019s been wildely pro stock market, always watching it like a hawk. He loves bantering about the stock market.\u201d\nCramer said that even though Trump was in \u201creal estate, he enjoyed stocks.\u201d\nJim Cramer added that Trump always thought there was too much regulation and was also \u201cwildly\u201d pro-oil and gas.\u00a0 The CNBC host said since Trump cannot see the stock market going down and sees the market gains as a positive factor even for his presidency, his arrival in the White House could boost stock portfolios.\n\u201cHate him or like him, he\u2019s good for your portfolio.\u201d\nFor this article watched the latest programs of Cramer where he mentioned stocks that could benefit from a Trump presidency. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that could see troubles if Donald Trump comes to power because of the China factor, according to Cramer. He said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has high exposure to China as the company makes \u201cChinese phones with Chinese labor\u201d\nHowever, there\u2019s a positive factor for Apple, too, if Trump comes to the White House, according to Cramer. He thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u00a0has been \u201cabused\u201d by the government on several regulatory issues.\n\u201cNeither of the candidates seems like Big Tech but Trump administration will certainly be more circumspect about hammering great American tech companies.\u201d\nDoes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have any AI growth catalysts? Wall Street is turning bullish on the company after Apple revealed Apple Intelligence plans at the WWDC event.\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it\u2019s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance after unveiling its AI strategy to its software developers. The Company has been at the forefront of proprietary computer processor development for over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well-situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) will likely report on Thursday that it returned to revenue growth in its fiscal third quarter as it won back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts and sold more high-margin iPads thanks to a refreshed design.\nSales of the iPhone, which account for nearly half of Apple's revenue, are expected to have decreased by 2.2% in the three months ended June, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter, according to LSEG data.\nAnalysts said the worst may be over for the iPhone.\nThey expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series likely to come in September after Apple said in June it was gearing up to introduce AI features across its devices.\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei in China, Apple had in May offered discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($317) on select iPhone models. This helped narrow iPhone sales declines in the country to 3.1% in the April-June quarter, according to IDC, from a decline of 6.6% in the first three months of the year.\n\"The company's fate is turning around in the region,\" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, adding that Apple's AI plans should appeal to customers in the feature-sensitive market.\nAfter lagging rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOG) Google in the AI race for months, Cupertino, California-based Apple unveiled plans to bring OpenAI's ChatGPT to its devices and burnish its suite of apps including Siri with new \"Apple Intelligence\" technology.\nThe commentary helped Apple regain the crown of the world's most valuable company it had lost for a few days to Microsoft. Apple's shares have risen nearly 30% in the past three months, though a recent market selloff led by megacaps led to the stock slipping more than 7% from its July 15 record.\n\"Apple's AI strategy announcements were very well received globally and helped improve the declining consumer perception of the brand and generate excitement,\" said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC's Worldwide Tracker team.\n\"I won't be surprised if there was a spike in iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models in the April-June quarter - that are Apple Intelligence ready,\" Popal added.\nOverall, Apple's revenue is expected to have risen 3.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, after a decline of 4.3% in the second quarter.\nIPad sales likely jumped 14.1%, the fastest growth since the holiday quarter of 2022, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for a product line that had languished for the past two years.\nMac sales are expected to have ticked up 2.6%, while its wearables and accessories business likely continued its slump with a decline of 6%.\nThe company's services business - including App Store and subscription services such as Apple TV and Music - likely grew 13.2%.\nGrowth in the segment has outperformed the company's mainstay hardware business in recent years and the services unit now accounts for more than a quarter of Apple's revenue. However, the outlook for the division has been muddied by regulatory scrutiny.\nThe European Union's antitrust regulator has accused Apple App Store of breaching the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires Big Tech to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice. The company is also facing three investigations under the DMA.\n\"Apple's services business has been a key part of the bull thesis on the stock. Its growth is particularly important given the very high marginal contribution of the business,\" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.\n($1 = 7.2513 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)\n"

Wall Street analysts have projected a dip in iPhone revenue in the latter half of 2024.\nApple shares saw a boost of up to 1.8% to $232.74, reaching a record high after Bloomberg reported on the iPhone projections. The stock has risen 19% this year through Tuesday\u2019s close.\nIn China, Apple also needs to find a partner since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT isn't available in the country. Additionally, Apple is grappling with a broader challenge in its largest market outside the US, as more Chinese agencies and government-backed firms have instructed staff to refrain from using iPhones and foreign devices at work.\nApple's challenges in China extend beyond tepid demand. The company recently petitioned the Supreme People\u2019s Court to remove references to its \"dominant position\" from a lower court's decision, underscoring the company's increasingly precarious position in the country.\nRelated Articles\nApple targets 10% iPhone shipment growth in 2024 - Bloomberg\nAckman says his firm will put $500 million into Pershing Square USA\nWK Kellog faces soggy outlook that puts margin expansion in crosshairs: BofA\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s upcoming artificial intelligence features will arrive later than anticipated, missing the initial launch of its upcoming iPhone and iPad software overhauls but giving the company more time to fix bugs.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump\u2019s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat\nIntel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound\nLuxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Herm\u00e8s Fortune Has Vanished\nUkraine Receives First F-16 Fighter Jets After Long Wait\nHamas Says Israel Killed Political Leader With Airstrike in Iran\nThe company is planning to begin rolling out Apple Intelligence to customers as part of software updates coming by October, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That means the AI features will arrive a few weeks after the initial iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 releases planned for September, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing unannounced release details.\nStill, the iPhone maker is planning to make Apple Intelligence available to software developers for the first time for early testing as soon as this week via iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 betas, they added. The strategy is atypical as the company doesn\u2019t usually release previews of follow-up updates until around the time the initial version of the new software generation is released publicly.\nThe stakes are higher than usual. In order to ensure a smooth consumer release of its big bet on AI, Apple needs support from developers to help iron out issues and test features on a wider scale. Concerns over the stability of Apple Intelligence features, in part, led the company to split the features from the initial launch of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18.\nApple announced the new features and operating systems in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference, saying Apple Intelligence would debut as part of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. The new timing means the AI capabilities won\u2019t be widely launched until a subsequent update to the new operating system. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\nThe tech giant launched a fourth beta of iOS 18.0 to developers last week and is aiming to complete development by the end of July. When Apple introduces new iPhones each September, the company includes the accompanying new software. That necessitates finishing the operating system several weeks earlier so there is time to install the software on the devices before shipping them out of the factory.\nThe release plan for Apple Intelligence presents the possibility that the first iPhone 16 models shipped to consumers this year will lack the new AI features and require a software update weeks later. Apple Intelligence includes a range of features, including prioritization of key notifications, web page and voice note summaries, tools to improve writing, a revamp to Siri and integration of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nEven when Apple Intelligence launches with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, it will be missing some features. That includes some of the most significant changes to Siri, such as the ability to use on-device data to help field queries and for the system to use what is on a person\u2019s screen to provide context for answers.\nThe company is planning to roll out its full set of Apple Intelligence features via multiple updates to iOS 18 across the end of 2024 and through the first half of 2025, Bloomberg News has reported. Beyond the iPhone and iPad, Apple Intelligence will come to its Mac computers with in-house Apple chips as part of macOS Sequoia. It\u2019s also in development for the Vision Pro, but a release for that device isn\u2019t planned until later.\nThe technology giant is betting on Apple Intelligence to help compete in the generative AI space that has taken the world by storm and upended both businesses and consumer devices over the past year. By limiting support to the iPhone 15 Pro from last year and the upcoming iPhone 16 line, Apple also believes the new features could help sell new iPhones this year.\nThe iPhone 16 line will have little in the way of design changes so software-related enhancements \u2014 in addition to a new button for controlling the camera and a faster chip \u2014 will do the heavy lifting to sell the new models.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\nInside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\nScammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta\u2019s Own Tools\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Apple is no longer one of the top five smartphone sellers in China, according to independent research, as the iPhone is dragged down by a soft economy, new competition, and reported government bans.\nResearch released by Canalys and IDC this week measuring smartphone shipments report that Apple dropped to sixth place in China's smartphone market last quarter. Chinese brands now occupy the top of the rankings, with both firms putting Vivo in the lead. Both Canalys and IDC rank Huawei, Oppo, HONOR and Xiaomi in the top five.\nApple shipped 9.7 million iPhones in the second quarter, a drop from the 10.4 million shipped this time last year, according to Canalys data. Overall, China's smartphone market grew by 10% year-on-year, with shipments exceeding 70 million units.\nCanalyst reports that Apple has 14% market share, a two percentage point decrease from the same period last year. IDC research shows a 3.1% decline in shipments, despite aggressive discounts in the second quarter of the year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first quarter in history that domestic vendors dominate all the top five positions,\u201d Canalys research analyst Lucas Zhong notes. \u201cChinese vendors\u2019 strategies for high-end products and their deep collaboration with local supply chains are starting to pay off in hardware and software features.\u201d\nAnalysts pointed to competition from Huawei as a reason for Apple's struggles. The U.S.-blacklisted tech company has seen a resurgence in fortunes since it released a new premium smartphone with a domestically-produced processor almost a year ago.\n\"Huawei's return did have a certain impact on Apple's performance, especially in the high-end segment,\" Will Wong, senior research manager for client devices research at IDC, said.\nXiaomi's smartphone sales surged thanks to the release of its new electric car, according to Canalys. Xiaomi started selling its new electric sedan, the SU7, from late-March.\nThe iPhone is an important moneymaker for Apple, making up just over half of its sales last year. The Greater China market, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan represented 19% of Apple\u2019s total 2023 revenue and is Apple\u2019s third largest region by sales.\nThere's a growing divide between independent assessments of Apple's business in China and the iPhone manufacturer's own statements. Earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that iPhone sales in China grew in the quarter ending March, though did not provide specifics.\nBut even as Apple slips in the rankings, IDC notes that the iPhone maker is still in a better position compared to 2020. IDC estimates Apple now has 13.6% of the Chinese smartphone market, compared to 8.3% in the third quarter of 2020.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Is Apple a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Just when investors thought shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) might have run out of momentum, the company's developer conference, where it unveiled an avalanche of upcoming products and features using artificial intelligence (AI), supercharged the stock and sent it to new highs.\nApple is arguably one of the most obvious AI stocks because generative AI perfectly fits the core experience of using iOS products. The million-dollar question is just how much upside remains in the stock for prospective investors today. Is Apple a buy? Here is what you need to know.\nIt's fair to say that AI is a big deal for Apple. The company recently unveiled numerous AI features it will build into its software. Some examples include custom emojis, integrating ChatGPT into Siri, and its in-house AI tech, Apple Intelligence. The influx of new technology could dramatically improve the user experience on iOS devices, which Apple was already known for.\nAfter years of limited functionality, I cannot wait for a better version of Siri. It doesn't seem like a stretch that others feel the same. A better experience with iOS devices likely means an even stickier Apple ecosystem. In other words, AI seems likely to enhance Apple's core business of selling iOS devices and services rather than harm it.\nAI's impact on Apple will determine whether it can get sales growth moving in the right direction again. As you can see below, Apple's revenue has peaked and begun declining in recent years. New iterations of the iPhone are released annually, and the year-to-year changes aren't as pronounced as a decade ago. The product has matured. Incremental camera, screen, and processor updates only go so far.\nCombine that with Apple's famously good build quality, and users no longer rush to upgrade their phones. An estimated 61% of iPhone owners wait at least two years to upgrade.\nGetting more iPhone users to upgrade could revive revenue growth, and AI could be the catalyst. It's not a bold statement to say that AI features are the most significant iPhone breakthrough since the first 5G phone, which sparked Apple's last growth spurt. Naturally, only Apple's newest phones, the iPhone 15 generation, will be compatible with AI. Time will tell if consumers are excited enough to splurge on new devices.\nIf the share price is any indication, Wall Street is confident AI will help Apple grow again. Shares have rocketed to all-time highs since Apple unveiled its AI plans. But here's the problem: The stock now trades at a forward P/E over 33, its highest valuation in recent memory.\nInvestors can equate a stock's valuation to expectations. The stock's average P/E for the past decade is just 21. Such a departure from long-term norms is Wall Street saying loud and clear, \"You better deliver the goods!\"\nAI sounds promising, but this is a lot to ask. Even analysts estimate just 10% annual earnings growth over the long term, which doesn't seem near enough to justify Apple's current price. Maybe Apple delivers and then some. It could justify the share price, but what about additional gains for investors who buy today? Or worse, what if AI doesn't impact Apple's business the way people hope and shares head to a lower valuation?\nThe reality is that AI hype has priced Apple stock for perfection. There is far more room for shares to go down than up, and even a best-case scenario doesn't seem to offer much to get excited about. Apple customers have a lot to look forward to with AI, but investors are best off staying away until the share price makes a lot more sense than it does now.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled its new artificial intelligence features dubbed \"Apple Intelligence\" at its Worldwide Developers Conference a few weeks ago. The highlights include text generation and summarization across apps, advanced AI-assisted photo editing capabilities, and a much smarter and more powerful Siri. It also integrates third-party services like ChatGPT for more advanced prompts.\nWhat makes Apple Intelligence so compelling is the amount of AI processing it does on the device. Instead of taking your query, sending it to a server along with any relevant data, waiting for the server to process your request, and then downloading the results to your device, the entire process happens on your iPhone, Mac, or iPad. For more advanced queries requiring a larger foundation model, Apple uses its own servers and system called Private Cloud Compute, which protects users' privacy.\nBoth of those developments could be a major win for one of Apple's biggest suppliers. Since all of these new features run on Apple-designed silicon, chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\u00a0(NYSE: TSM) could see an increase in orders due to Apple Intelligence. What's more, as Apple leads the way in on-device AI processing, it could push other device makers to buy more advanced chips from TSMC as well.\nWith Apple Intelligence, Apple is ushering in the next phase of artificial intelligence known as edge AI (when data and algorithms are processed directly on the end device, in this case a smartphone, tablet, or personal computer).\nIn order to process AI queries on device, though, the devices need to be capable. That means hardware that's even just a few years old might not be able to handle AI requests as well as newer devices can, if they can even handle them at all. Apple, for example, is limiting Apple Intelligence features to the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the forthcoming iPhone 16 devices. (Note the limiting factor here is the amount of short-term memory, or RAM, on the device, not the processors themselves.)\nAs a result, Apple could see strong demand from users eager to upgrade their phones over the next few years as Apple Intelligence features roll out around the world. And more iPhone sales means more demand for TSMC's chips.\nBut TSMC doesn't just supply chips for Apple. It manufactures the majority of chips in the world, accounting for over 60% of the market. That scale gives it a massive competitive advantage over smaller foundries, as it can invest more money in R&D to develop more advanced processes to print more powerful and energy-efficient chips. That ensures it keeps existing customers like Apple that are looking for leading-edge chips, and it attracts more of their business. It also helps TSMC draw in new customers as innovations like edge AI push companies to adopt new chip designs.\nIn order to support third-party large language models (LLMs) and its own more advanced LLM, Apple created Private Cloud Compute (PCC). The system uses Apple servers that also deploy the tech titan's own chip designs.\nIt's worth noting that Apple isn't using the platform to train AI models. It's using PCC to process data and algorithms that would require more compute power than what's available on consumer devices. The first implementation is sending prompts to ChatGPT.\nThere's a lot of potential for Apple to grow its data center capacity as it partners with more businesses and developers looking to integrate their AI services with Apple's platform. When the company announced its partnership with OpenAI's ChatGPT, it said it's working to bring more partners to the platform later this year. If Apple pushes developers to use PCC, it could further increase Apple's demand for TSMC's services. It also offers another way for Apple to generate income from developers.\nThere's a long runway for Apple to grow AI features through third-party integrations. Just consider the phenomenal growth of the App Store over the past 15 years. Similar growth would be a boon for both Apple and TSMC.\nTSMC already has a market cap of around $900 billion. Even so, shares look undervalued at today's price given the growth potential spurred by continued demand for AI chips.\nThe stock trades for about 27x forward earnings estimates, which is a more than fair price to pay. It should be able to grow its earnings fast enough to justify that price as demand for more advanced chips supports its top-line growth and improves its operating margins. Analysts expect earnings will increase over 25% next year.\nA strong iPhone upgrade cycle over the next few years, incremental demand from Apple's new data centers, and the overall push toward edge computing all favor\u00a0TSMC's continued growth. Its competitive advantage in creating the most advanced, powerful, and energy-efficient chips will serve it well over the next few years. It's only a matter of time before the company tops a $1 trillion market cap.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The past year has been an underwhelming one for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors, as shares of the technology giant have appreciated only 13% as compared to the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's gains of 24% during the same period. However, a closer look at the recent stock-price action indicates that the tech giant is regaining its mojo.\nApple stock has jumped 33% in the past three months. This impressive rally can be attributed to Apple's long-awaited move into artificial intelligence (AI), as well as a turnaround in the smartphone market's fortunes. However, will these two catalysts be enough to help Apple stock sustain its recent rally and deliver healthy gains over the next year?\nLet's find out.\nMarket research firm IDC recently released smartphone shipment data for the second quarter of 2024. It reported a 6.5% year-over-year increase in smartphone shipments for the quarter. Apple was the second-largest player in the smartphone market last quarter with a market share of 15.8%. The company's shipments, however, increased only 1.5% year over year, which led to a small drop in its market share from the year-ago period\u00a0 when it had a 16.6% market share.\nHowever, the drop in Apple's shipments last quarter is on expected lines as the current generation of its iPhones is close to a year old now. The company is expected to launch an AI-enabled generation of smartphones in a couple of months, and that could give its shipments a nice boost.\nEarlier this year, the tech giant took the wraps off Apple Intelligence, which is its suite of AI features that will be embedded into iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks. The AI tool will give users the ability to summarize, proofread, and even create different versions of the same text. Additionally, Apple Intelligence plans to put time-sensitive messages at the top of users' inboxes to help them focus on the more important things.\nAnother key feature of Apple Intelligence is its ability to convert audio recordings into text-based summaries and transcripts. Apple will be offering its AI features on iPhone 15 Pro models, iPads, and MacBooks with the M1 or more powerful chips. In simpler words, Apple's users will need to upgrade to its latest devices to use its AI solutions.\nThis is why the iPhone 16 models could see a significant bump in sales, especially considering that the entire lineup is expected to be AI-enabled. A report from Bloomberg points out that there could be a 10% increase in Apple's iPhone shipments this year thanks to AI. This, however, is not the only way Apple could benefit from AI adoption.\nIDC points out that Apple's personal computer (PC) shipments jumped almost 21% from a year ago to 5.7 million units in the second quarter. The tech giant's growth significantly outpaced the 3% growth in overall PC shipments during the quarter. This trend could continue in the future as Apple is reportedly looking to refresh its MacBook lineup to support AI features.\nSo, Apple has a couple of solid growth drivers for the coming year in the form of AI-enabled smartphones and PCs. Gartner estimates that a total of 295 million generative AI-powered smartphones and PCs could be shipped in 2024 as compared to just 29 million units last year. As such, there is a solid chance that Apple's growth could be better than the market's expectations over the coming year.\nAnalysts are expecting Apple to finish the current fiscal year, which ends in September, with $387.4 billion in revenue. That would be an increase of 8% from the prior year. Its revenue growth is expected to remain in the high-single digits in fiscal 2025 as well.\nAAPL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\nHowever, the significant jump in Apple's MacBook sales, the arrival of AI smartphones, and a potential improvement in its services revenue in case it decides to monetize the Apple Intelligence platform could help it grow at a faster pace than what analysts are forecasting in the next one year and beyond. All these reasons indicate why there has been an improvement in Apple's price targets of late.\nMorgan Stanley lifted the price target on Apple stock to $273, which would translate into a 21% jump from current levels. Meanwhile, Loop Capital's $300 price target would translate into a 33% jump from where Apple stock is right now. The AI-related growth drivers indicate that Apple could indeed live up to the market's expectations and sustain its healthy stock-market momentum, which should translate into stronger gains in the coming year.\nThat's why investors will do well to continue holding Apple stock in their portfolios as it could have a better year ahead as compared to the previous one.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential.\u00a0Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management\u2019s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some \u201cprofit taking\u201d and invest in names that can benefit \u201cmore\u201d from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to \u201cfall in line with historical returns.\u201d\nLip thinks the economy is entering a \u201cGoldilocks scenario\u201d where growth is steady but not \u201chot enough\u201d to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said \u201cslightly\u201d lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple is one of the top AI names in King Lip\u2019s portfolio.\nApple is also among the top picks of Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives for the second half of 2024.\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in \u201cdenial\u201d about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock\u2019s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) skeptics have long believed that the company is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) almost always makes its own way and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet.

Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "With fiscal 2023 revenue of $383 billion and a current market cap of $3.4 trillion (as of July 1), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most widely followed companies on the face of the planet. It sells some of the most popular products out there, and the brand carries incredible power and recognition.\nMany investors are likely confident they're very familiar with Apple. However, there's one little-known fact that can't be overlooked when it comes to this \"Magnificent Seven\" business.\nIn fiscal 2023, Apple generated $298 billion, or 78% of its total revenue, from the sale of hardware devices. And unsurprisingly, the iPhone represented the vast majority of this figure. This isn't groundbreaking news. Apple's success can be attributed to its ability to create beautifully designed and easy-to-use products that consumers can't seem to get enough of. And this is what it's still known for today.\nHowever, the software and services segment has been rising quickly in importance, and it could be something that many investors might not realize.\nLast fiscal year, $85 billion, or 22% of total revenue, came from software and services. This figure is up 84% compared to fiscal 2019. That pace of growth is much faster than the 39% gain registered by the device\u00a0segment during the same time. In other words, this hardware business is slowly transitioning to a digital enterprise.\nApple's software and services offerings include AppleCare, iCloud, Pay, Card, Music, Fitness+, TV+, News+, Arcade, and the App Store. Additionally, digital advertising is lumped into this segment as well. \nBesides driving faster growth, this division helps Apple on the bottom line. Software and services posted a stellar gross margin of 75% in Q2 2024 (ended March 30), comparing very favorably to the 37% gross margin on devices. As less revenue is derived from hardware, the tech giant should theoretically see profits rise.\nSoftware and services also benefit Apple because they are precisely what creates the company's powerful ecosystem. The great Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has a $171 billion stake in the company, once clearly articulated what makes Apple so special.\nHe said that if you offered someone $10,000 on the condition that they could never use an iPhone again for the rest of their life, that person would most likely decline. I believe this is because of Apple's hardware and software and how well they work together to attract and lock in consumers.\nThere are currently more than 2 billion active Apple devices across the globe. This gives the business unrivaled distribution when it comes to developing and launching new software offerings and features. Consequently, it's still critical to understand that hardware remains vital to Apple's success.\nBut this is proving to be a problem. Now that 17 years have passed since its initial launch, the iPhone is a mature product. Shareholders can't expect this single product to drive sizable, durable growth over the long haul. In fact, Apple's revenue dropped 2.8% in fiscal 2023. And it's only projected to increase at a compound annual rate of 5.3% over the next three years.\nThe muted growth prospects are the key reason why I don't believe investors should be buying this stock. The other obvious reason is Apple's valuation. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, which represents an eye-popping 57% premium to the trailing-10-year average. This leads me to believe that returns going forward are likely to disappoint.\nWhile Apple is one of the most competitively advantaged and financially sound businesses the world has ever seen, that doesn't automatically mean it deserves a spot in your portfolio right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The market expects Apple (AAPL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.6%.\nRevenues are expected to be $83.79 billion, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?\nFor Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.23%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of +1.32%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nApple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  MICHAEL LIEDTKE ",
        "Text": "Apple snapped out of a prolonged sales slump during its most recent quarter as the trendsetting company prepares to launch into the artificial intelligence craze with an arsenal of new technology that\u2019s expected to juice demand for its next iPhone.\nThe fiscal third-quarter results announced Thursday covered an April-June period that\u2019s typically a sluggish stretch for Apple as its loyal customer bases awaits the next version of the iPhone that\u2019s traditionally unveiled shortly after Labor Day.\nEven so, Apple boosted its sales from a year ago \u2014 a welcome reversal of fortune on the heels of five consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines.\nThis time around, Apple\u2019s revenue rose 5% from a year to $85.78 billion \u2014 a figure that exceeded analysts\u2019 projections. The Cupertino, California, company earned $21.45 billion, or $1.40 per share, an 8% increase from the same time last year. The profit also topped analyst forecasts.\nApple's shares swung between slight increases and modest declines in Thursday's extended trading as investors assessed the results.\nSales of the iPhone \u2014 Apple\u2019s marquee product \u2014 remained on a downward slope though, dipping 1% from last year to $39.3 billon. That decrease wasn\u2019t as bad as the January-March period when iPhone sales plummeted 10% from last year, and now the product appears headed toward a major upswing.\nThat\u2019s because Apple is planning to roll out a variety of artificial intelligence features that are supposed to make its virtual assistant Siri smarter and also perform a variety of helpful and fun tasks, including helping to draft texts and even creating unique emojis on demand. The AI tools will be included in a free software update expected in the autumn, but most of the features will only work on iPhones with a special chip that so far has only been available on two premium models Apple released last year.\nThe next model, the iPhone 16, is expected to be equipped with the AI chip \u2014 a factor that analysts believe will spur consumers who have been holding on to their older devices to splurge on upgrades so they can take advantage of the new features. That expectation is the main reason why Apple\u2019s stock price has surged 13% since the company previewed its AI tools in early June \u2014 a run-up that has created about $400 billion in shareholder wealth so far.\n\u201cI believe it will be a very key time for a compelling upgrade cycle,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a Thursday conference call.\nApple\u2019s push into AI may also fuel its steadily growing services division, which saw its revenue climb 14% from last year to $24.21 billion in the most recent quarter. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it's confronting regulatory threats that could drag down its performance.\nA lucrative deal that generates about $20 billion in revenue by making Google the default search engine on the iPhone and Safari browser is being targeted in a high-profile antitrust case that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Google. A federal judge is expected is to issue a ruling by the end of this year.\nThe Justice Department also is targeting Apple in a separate lawsuit that it filed in March, alleging the company is illegally locking out competition by erecting unnecessary barriers around the iPhone. Apple has adamantly denied any wrongdoing and launched an attempt to have the case dismissed in documents filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court.\nThat started a legal process that will take several more months to play out before the presiding judge decides whether to throw out the case or allow it to proceed in a ruling likely to come late this year or early next year.\nAs has been happening during much of the past year, Apple\u2019s sales continued to erode in China \u2014 a worry for investors because the region is one of the company\u2019s key markets. Apple\u2019s revenue in China dropped 7% from last year in the past quarter.\n"

        "Title": "Forget Apple: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "Author": "  James Brumley, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is once again the world's largest company (as measured by market cap) right now. It's also one of the most profitable (as measured by total profits generated).\u00a0 But that wasn't always the case. It earned its way to these accolades with sustained growth largely set in motion by 2007's debut of the iPhone.\nHowever, investors know that past performance is no guarantee of future results. What got Apple to where it is today doesn't seem to be working quite as well lately. Sales of its top products have been stagnant for a couple of years, in fact. While the stock's been soaring since May 1 (up 38%), it's currently sitting just 6% above analysts' consensus price target. Weakness may well be on the horizon. That has some investors considering other options.\nSo, if you're looking for a new pick, there are three better options than Apple to consider.\nThere's no sense in not beginning with the market's most fruitful stock pick of this century so far. That's Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), of course. Shares of the e-commerce giant are up an amazing 257,000% since the company's 1997 initial public offering, soaring in step with the expansion of the then-nascent internet.\nThe company's fastest growth and the stock's fastest gains are likely in the past, of course, as the e-commerce market is mature even if it's not yet at its peak potential But there's still plenty of growth in store given Amazon's more nascent business lines.\nOne of these young ventures is cloud computing. Although Amazon Web Services only accounts for about 16% of the company's revenue, this revenue grew 13% year over year in 2023. Given that cloud computing services already drive roughly two-thirds of the company's operating income, even merely modest growth on this front could remain impactful. That's what makes Mordor Intelligence's outlook for the global cloud computing market so compelling for Amazon shareholders. The research outfit expects an annualized growth rate of 16% through 2029.\nThe company's e-commerce platform is also evolving. Although it still generates revenue and earnings on every item sold at Amazon.com, it's generating much more higher-margin revenue as an advertising platform. Sellers paid a total of nearly $47 billion last year to more prominently feature their products at the well-trafficked website, monetizing it in a way that wasn't even an afterthought just a few years back.\nAgain, neither Amazon nor Amazon stock will repeat the feat achieved during the first 30 years of the company's existence. The next 30 years, however, could still be pretty darn rewarding.\nYou've almost certainly heard of the company. You may not know, however, a single thing Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)\u00a0manufactures. That's because nearly everything it makes is found on the inside of the electronics you regularly rely on. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, fiber-optic connection components, data-storage device boards, and a wide range of automation software are just a sampling of its offerings. Without Broadcom's tech, the world would look considerably different.\nMore important to interested investors, the need for Broadcom's technologies isn't going away anytime soon, if ever. Consumers and corporations alike are far too reliant on mobile phones, wireless networking, data centers (for artificial intelligence), and cybersecurity -- all markets that Broadcom serves -- to simply cease using them now.\nAlso know that Broadcom's technology remains well protected by patents. It holds more than 45,000 of them, with roughly one-third of them in active use right now, according to Insights by GreyB. Just late last year the company successfully enforced a key patent against streaming powerhouse Netflix.\nFinally, add Coca-Cola\u00a0(NYSE: KO) to your list of unstoppable stocks to buy instead of Apple.\nIt's obviously a very different outfit than either Amazon or Broadcom. It operates a slow-growth, cash-driving business that generates tons of reliable cash. Indeed, the beverage behemoth hasn't just been able to pay a dividend like clockwork for decades now. It's raised its annual payment every year for the past 62 years; the most recent increase was a 5.4% improvement, extending a long streak of inflation-beating payout growth. Coke shares are also up a hefty 26,400% for that time frame, bolstering the gains stemming from its reliable dividend payments.\nIt's a tough act to follow to be sure. In fact, the next 62 years aren't apt to be nearly as fruitful for shareholders as the past 62 have been. There's just too much competition in the well-developed and highly competitive beverage business these days.\nThat doesn't mean the next six decades, however, still can't be amazingly rewarding.\nSee, while Coca-Cola's business isn't complicated, the company handles the most crucial aspects of it brilliantly. That's marketing, mostly. It's been able to use lifestyle-oriented advertising to create brand names and product logos that consumers readily recognize. Purchasing its products has become a habit for many of its customers.\nIt's also worth pointing out that operating in the consumer staples space makes it easier for the company to continue selling goods to a crowd that might occasionally rethink purchases of more cyclical products and services like automobiles, vacations, or home improvements. More to the point, this competitive edge within a resilient business should keep The Coca-Cola Company's stock reliably chugging along.\nIt will never be a growth stock, to be clear. What the company lacks in growth firepower, however, it more than makes up for in consistent forward progress.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's most valuable company again with a market cap of $3.57 billion. Its stock rallied more than 60% over the past three years, even as iPhone sales cooled off amid tougher macro and competitive headwinds.\nFrom fiscal 2023 (ended last September) to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Apple's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% as its earnings per share (EPS) rises at a CAGR of 10%. That growth will likely be driven by a cyclical recovery in iPhone sales, an expansion into higher-growth markets like India, and the evolution of Apple's subscription ecosystem that hosts over a billion subscribers. Apple will also likely repurchase tens of billions of dollars in shares every year to boost its EPS.\nThose growth rates make Apple a stable long-term investment, but they're a bit weak for a stock that trades at 35 times forward earnings and 9 times this year's sales. Therefore, Apple's valuations might have been inflated by the recent hype regarding its generative AI plans for its first-party apps. Assuming Apple meets Wall Street's estimates and still trades at the same price-to-sales ratio by fiscal 2026, its market cap could grow about 12% to $4.01 billion by the final year.\nThat market cap would still make Apple one of the world's most valuable companies, but I believe three of its trillion-dollar peers \u2014 Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) \u2014 could eclipse its valuation over the next three years.\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet operate different business models. Apple generates more than half of its revenue from the iPhone, but it relies on its services business to drive most of its growth. Nvidia generates most of its revenue by selling high-end data centers for processing AI tasks.\nMicrosoft generates over half of its revenue from its cloud businesses, which include its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Office 365 productivity services, and Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) services. Alphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, its advertising network, and YouTube. However, its smaller Google Cloud business is growing at a much faster clip than its core advertising business.\nAll four companies have been expanding their generative AI ecosystems. Apple recently integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its own apps and announced new generative AI features for creating images and writing text. Microsoft, which is OpenAI's top investor, integrates the start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services.\nAlphabet has been upgrading its Gemini generative AI platform to keep up with OpenAI, and it's been rolling out those tools across its entire ecosystem. Nvidia profits from that secular trend by selling the best \"picks and shovels\" for the AI gold rush.\nBut out of these four companies, only Apple generates most of its sales from a slower-growth and cyclical consumer electronics business. Nvidia is a high-growth chipmaker, Microsoft is a cloud and AI play, and Alphabet is a digital advertising company. That's why analysts expect all three companies to grow faster than Apple over the next three years.\nCompany\nEstimated Revenue CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years)\nEstimated EPS CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years)\nCurrent Market Capitalization\nPrice-to-Sales Ratio (Forward)\nApple\n5%\n10%\n$3.57 billion\n9\nNvidia\n46%\n53%\n$3.26 billion\n28\nMicrosoft\n15%\n17%\n$3.47 billion\n14\nAlphabet\n11%\n20%\n$2.37 billion\n7\nData source: MarketScreener.\nAssuming they match those estimates and their price-to-sales ratios hold steady, Nvidia could be worth $5.3 trillion by fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), Microsoft would be worth $4.5 trillion by fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), and Alphabet's market cap could reach $3 trillion. But with the same price-to-sales ratio as Microsoft, Alphabet's market cap could nearly reach $6 trillion. Therefore, all three tech giants have a shot at eclipsing Apple's market cap over the next three years.\nIt's interesting to track the market caps of the world's largest companies, but it's a superficial approach that glosses over their core strengths and weaknesses.\nAll four of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks will likely keep growing. Apple is a rock-solid investment in the mobile computing market, Microsoft and Google are evolving into cloud and AI companies, and Nvidia is still arguably the best pure play on the AI accelerator chip market. So instead of wondering which tech giant will be the most valuable in three years, investors should simply focus on their ability to expand their ecosystems, widen their moats, and generate consistent growth.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock edged 2% higher in premarket trading Monday after Morgan Stanley analysts upgraded it to a Top Pick and raised the price target from $216 to $273.\nThe move comes as analysts now have a strong conviction that the introduction of Apple Intelligence, and its limited backward compatibility, can trigger a multi-year refresh cycle for Apple devices.\n\u201cHowever, what we had previously underestimated, and what the market still underappreciates today, is just how material the impending upgrade cycle can be,\u201d analysts noted.\nBased on their analysis of Apple's upgradeable iPhone base, upgrade rates, new user growth, and model mix, Apple is poised to ship nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years\u2014235 million in the fiscal year (FY) 2025 and 262 million in FY26.\nThis is 6% higher than the record FY21-FY22 cycle, with a 5% annual growth in iPhone average selling price (ASP), leading to nearly $485 billion in total revenue and $8.70 in earnings by FY26, compared to $459 billion and $8.20 previously, which is 7-9% above consensus, according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis.\nAlongside three key near-term catalysts in fiscal Q3 earnings \u2013 the mid-September iPhone launch, potential positive iPhone build revisions in mid-October, and the historical trend of accelerating unit growth driving Apple stock outperformance \u2013 AAPL\u2019s recent outperformance \u201cis sustainable,\u201d analysts believe.\nTheir conviction in the upgrade cycle is supported by several unprecedented factors in Apple's history: an installed base of over 1.3 billion devices, extended replacement cycles averaging 4.8 years, and a new technology limited to just 8% of the iPhone/iPad installed base.\n\u201cWhile historically we'd contemplate 230-240m annual iPhone shipments in a strong cycle, these factors portend that annual shipments could reach 260-290m units, significantly higher than the 230-235m iPhone shipments the market is currently pricing in for each of the next 2 years.\"\nThe introduction of Apple Intelligence is expected to boost more than just iPhone shipments, analysts pointed out. Users will need an iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max or newer models to use Apple Intelligence, which will drive a positive mix shift and iPhone ASP growth. Currently, only 24% of iPads can run Apple Intelligence, suggesting a potential mini upgrade cycle for the iPad as well.\nThe analysts forecast that in FY25 and FY26, 66-69% of iPhones shipped will be new models, which is 2-6 points higher than FY24 and 3 points above the previous peak in FY22, leading to 4-5% annual iPhone ASP growth.\nFor iPads, they estimate that the introduction of Apple Intelligence could reduce replacement cycles to 3.8 years, the pre-COVID average from FY18-FY19.\n\u201cSo while growth in iPhone units will account for 36% of Apple's total revenue growth through FY26, higher iPhone ASPs and iPad growth will account for another 26% of total revenue growth,\u201d they continued.\nMoreover, analysts believe Apple\u2019s outlook in China is also set to improve. Over the past year, Apple lost 6 points of market share in China's high-end smartphone segment, mainly due to stronger competition and sluggish iPhone demand. However, recent quarters show stabilization, and with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, Morgan Stanley analysts believe Apple can drive strong upgrades in that market.\nRelated Articles\nApple stock rises as Morgan Stanley names it Top Pick ahead of iPhone 16 launch\nFutures rise on higher odds of Trump victory after shooting\nApple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s India sales soar 33% to new highs - Bloomberg\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) is giving developers an early look at its upcoming Apple Intelligence AI platform with the release of its latest developer betas for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS on Monday. The betas, called iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia, are the first to include Apple\u2019s highly anticipated Apple Intelligence software, which the company debuted at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June.\nApple\u2019s developer beta program gives app creators access to upcoming versions of the company\u2019s software to test it and incorporate its features into their own apps. Apple also releases public betas for regular users to try its latest software offerings before making them generally available in the fall.\nThe company has already debuted developer and public betas for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. The developer betas released Monday, however, include a host of Apple Intelligence features including Writing Tools, an improved version of Siri that can understand both voice and text inputs, AI options in Mail like email summarizations and Smart Replies, and AI-powered summarization for transcriptions.\nApple\u2019s ChatGPT integration and the ability to use Siri to take certain actions in third-party apps will be available in future developer betas.\nDevelopers will be able to access Apple Intelligence via a new Apple Intelligence and Siri button in their device\u2019s Settings menu. From there, they\u2019ll be able to join a waitlist that should allow them to start using the feature within a few hours. The waitlist is necessary because Apple Intelligence uses both on-device and cloud processing and Apple wants to ensure it doesn\u2019t overwhelm its cloud services by bringing on too many new users at once.\nApple\u2019s announcement follows a report by Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman on Sunday indicating that Apple will launch Apple Intelligence in October rather than in September when the company usually debuts its latest iPhone. That means if you buy Apple\u2019s next-generation iPhone, which is expected to be called the iPhone 16, you might need to wait a few weeks before you can use the AI platform.\nAccording to Gurman, Apple is taking more time to develop Apple Intelligence while giving developers additional time to acclimate themselves to the software and build out new features.\nApple Intelligence is a massive undertaking for the iPhone maker, bringing some of the biggest changes to its software platforms in years. It will also be the first time many of the company\u2019s users take advantage of generative artificial intelligence technologies. Nailing the delivery and rollout will be essential to ensuring Apple\u2019s millions of users can not only access Apple Intelligence but actually enjoy using it.\nSome on Wall Street believe Apple Intelligence will be a boon for Apple. Analysts are anticipating that the technology will boost iPhone sales, leading to an elevated upgrade cycle.\nApple has made it so that only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max can run the software, meaning if you have an iPhone 15 or even iPhone 14 Pro, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to an iPhone 15 Pro or newer to use the AI platform.\nOthers, however, argued that consumers are simply ready to upgrade the phones they purchased around the onset of the pandemic, and that that pent-up demand, not Apple Intelligence, will drive a strong sales cycle in the year ahead.\nApple will also have to avoid the same kind of embarrassing incidents that have bedeviled rivals like Google, which launched its AI Overviews service for Search only for the software to end up telling users to put glue in their pizza and eat rocks.\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) and long-time collaborator Samsung have also launched generative AI features for their respective smartphones, with Samsung debuting its Galaxy AI alongside its Galaxy S24 line of phones earlier this year and Google showing off its Pixel 8 with AI capabilities in October 2023.\nGoogle is also set to debut its next-generation Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold phones during an event at its headquarters on Aug. 13. The company is widely expected to focus on how its generative AI software will improve the overall user experience for its devices.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Apple stock has surged 30% since the second quarter, and now all eyes will be on the tech giant\u2019s upcoming earnings report scheduled for August 1.\nBernstein analysts expect Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Q3 earnings to align closely with consensus estimates, projecting revenues of $83.7 billion, a 2.3% year-over-year increase, compared to the consensus estimate of $84.3 billion.\nThe anticipated revenue growth is supported by improving iPhone sales in China and strong performance in the iPad and Mac segments.\n\u201cThat said, we do not expect material revenue upside in the quarter,\u201d the investment firm\u2019s analysts added.\nLooking ahead to Q4, the consensus models higher-than-seasonal growth, which Bernstein views as aggressive. They predict that Apple might guide lower on revenue for Q4, estimating $89.3 billion compared to the consensus of $92.3 billion. However, they believe this guidance might not heavily impact investor sentiment, as attention is shifting toward the iPhone 16 and FY 2025.\n\u201cA key question is whether an upgrade cycle could get pushed out beyond FY 25,\u201d Bernstein analysts continued.\n\u201cWe continue to expect AI functionality to lead to a strong upgrade cycle, and that it may not be a bad thing for the stock if AI tailwinds are spread out between the iPhone 16 and 17 cycles,\u201d they added.\nAnalysts highlighted several key areas to watch in Apple\u2019s upcoming earnings print.\nAmong those is growth in the company\u2019s Services unit, which has outgrown the rest of Apple's business, contributing significantly to revenue. They project Services revenue growth for Q3 at 13% and 12% for the year, supported by strong growth in iCloud, licensing, and the App Store.\nMeanwhile, the health of Apple's China business remains a concern, despite stronger iPhone volumes in May. There are doubts about the accuracy of third-party data and the sustainability of this strength, given that it partly resulted from discounting.\nApple\u2019s product gross margins have also improved significantly, driven by various factors including higher iPhone mix and lower depreciation expenses. However, Bernstein analysts caution rising memory prices and price concessions on iPhones could pressure margins in the future.\n\u201cWhile the impact might not be felt until the iPhone 16 cycle, we believe investors should closely monitor commentary around the gross margin forces at work. We forecast Q4 gross margins to decline sequentially from 46.3% to 46.1%,\u201d analysts wrote.\nMoreover, any changes to R&D and capex spending plans \u2013 particularly related to the build-out of private cloud compute \u2013 and broader commentary on Apple Intelligence will also be closely scrutinized, they noted.\nBernstein has reiterated an Outperform rating on AAPL stock ahead of its Q3 report, with a price target of $240.\n\u201cWe believe recent enthusiasm is likely to persist in the near term, as Apple is increasingly seen as an AI leader rather than a laggard, and the stock is also in its seasonally strong trading period,\u201d the firm\u2019s team explained.\nRelated Articles\nApple stock is up 30% since Q2.

        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney and Aditya Soni\n(Reuters) -Apple said its third-quarter iPhone sales were better than expected and forecast more gains on Thursday as it bets on artificial intelligence to attract buyers, even as its overall China business disappointed.\nShares of the company rose nearly 1% in extended trading, outperforming other tech stocks that were broadly lower.\nApple is expected to launch this fall what analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone. It includes artificial intelligence features and comes at a time when rivals such as Samsung have been quicker to roll out similar services.\nApple said revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter would grow at a level similar to the 4.9% increase it posted in the April-June period, which was better than analysts' estimates.\nSales of iPhone also improved in the third quarter, falling just 0.9% compared with the 2.2% drop analysts expected.\nChief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview that the iPhone results were better than he had expected three months ago. \"The iPhone 15 family has been doing well from the very beginning and still now - we have three quarters of the year behind us. It is performing better than the previous cycle, the iPhone 14.\"\nStill, China - Apple's third-largest market - remained a drag as sales there declined 6.5%. While that was an improvement from the 8.1% decline in the previous quarter, it was wider than expectations for a drop of 2.4%, according to Visible Alpha.\nMaestri said China sales fell less than 3%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and added that he feels good about Apple's performance in that country, given any softness in its economy.\nApple has taken to discounting its iPhones in China to compete with the much cheaper alternative smartphones offered by local competitors such as Huawei. The company in May offered discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($317) on selected models.\nAI PUSH\nAnalysts expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series, likely to be launched in September. The company unveiled a raft of AI products and services it calls Apple Intelligence at its developer conference in June.\nTo operate Apple Intelligence requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro, which may push consumers to upgrade their devices.\nWhile some analysts said that some consumers might have purchased the top-end iPhone 15 devices to tap the upcoming Apple Intelligence features, CEO Tim Cook told investors on Thursday it was \"too early to tell\" if that was driving upgrades.\nApple's AI features have arrived later than offerings by rivals including Samsung Electronics, which has introduced competing devices aimed at hosting AI chatbots. Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are placing huge bets on AI as well.\n\"The company's future success depends on two factors: keeping AI development costs low and ensuring that new AI-driven features compel price-sensitive consumers to upgrade their devices,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.\nApple started ramping up research and development spending last year, and Cook has said it has spent more than $100 billion on R&D in the past five years.\nMaestri told Reuters on Thursday that the company maintains \"very good gross margins\" despite the sometimes burdensome costs associated with building and running AI applications.\nApple splits its AI infrastructure costs between its own data centers and other cloud providers with whom it contracts.\nOn the regulatory front, Apple faces three probes in the European Union related to the Digital Markets Act, which requires large tech companies to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice. The bloc's antitrust regulator has accused Apple's App Store of breaching the DMA.\nIn the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market and driving up prices.\nApple's quarterly earnings per share were $1.40, above Wall Street estimates of $1.35, according to LSEG data.\nSales in Apple's services segment, which includes the App Store and represents Apple Music and TV products, rose 14.1% to $24.21 billion, above analyst expectations of $24.01 billion, according to LSEG data.\nMac sales grew 2.5% to $7.01 billion, compared with estimates of $7.02 billion, according to LSEG data.\nThe company's sales in the iPad segment increased by 23.7% to $7.16 billion, above analyst expectations of $6.61 billion, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for a product line that had languished for the past two years.\nIn the company's wearables segment, which represents sales of Apple Watches and AirPods headphones, sales fell 2.3% to $8.10 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $7.79 billion, according to LSEG data.\nApple maintained its dividend at 25 cents. In the fiscal second quarter, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) is expected to launch its next-generation AI-centric iPhone in September, but the company's Apple Intelligence software platform may not be enough to spark a new sales supercycle in 2025. That's according to UBS Global Research analyst David Vogt, who says Apple's market share losses in China to homegrown companies like Huawei, act as a \"material governor on iPhone unit growth.\"\nApple is heavily dependent on iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market by total revenue behind the Americas and Europe. In 2023, China accounted for $72.56 billion of Apple's $383.3 billion in revenue. The Americas brought in $162.6 billion, while Europe made up $94.3 billion.\nThe resurgence of Huawei, which was initially kneecapped by US sanctions on high-powered smartphone chips in 2019 but has since released phones with sufficiently advanced chips, has meant increased competition for Apple in China. That, coupled with a tepid economic environment, led to slower iPhone sales in the region in the early part of the year.\nApple has attempted to goose sales for Chinese consumers, offering deep discounts across the Greater China market. And by some measures it's working. According to Bloomberg, iPhone shipments increased as much as 50% in April and 40% in May.\nDespite those gains, Huawei could still pose a threat to Apple's growth in China. To counter that, and build sales in other regions, the company announced its new Apple Intelligence platform during its WWDC event in June. But according to Apple, the software, which infuses generative AI technologies across apps ranging from Messages and Photos to the iPhone's Calculator app, requires powerful processors only found in the iPhone 15 Pro line and, presumably, future iPhones.\nThat means users who want to take advantage of Apple Intelligence but have older iPhones or even the standard iPhone 15 will have to pony up to use the new software.\nStill, Apple isn't the only company rolling out generative AI technologies. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have already debuted their own generative AI-powered smartphones, and you can expect more Android device makers to do the same.\nSamsung is also gearing up for its annual Unpacked event next week, where it is expected to launch its newest foldable phones, while Google is aiming to announce its own updated Pixel smartphone lineup in August.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple relied on chips designed by Google rather than industry leader Nvidia to build two key components of its artificial intelligence software infrastructure for its forthcoming suite of AI tools and features, an Apple research paper published on Monday showed.\nApple's decision to rely on Google's cloud infrastructure is notable because Nvidia produces the most sought-after AI processors.\nIncluding the chips made by Google, Amazon.com and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.\nIn the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it used no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.\nApple did not comment on Monday.\nThe iPhone maker said that to train its AI models, it used two flavors of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organized in large clusters of chips.\nTo build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.\nNvidia does not design TPUs but rather focuses its efforts on so-called graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used for AI efforts.\nUnlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google sells access to TPUs through its Google Cloud Platform. Customers interested in buying access must build software through Google's cloud platform in order to use the chips.\nApple is rolling out portions Apple Intelligence to its beta users this week.\nReuters reported the use of the TPU chips in June, but Apple did not disclose the full extent of its reliance on Google hardware until Monday's research paper.\nGoogle did not return a request for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.\nApple's engineers said in the paper it would be possible to make even larger, more sophisticated models with Google's chips, than the two models it discussed in the paper.\nApple unveiled a slew of new AI features at its June developer conference, including integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its software.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company's stock ticked down 0.1% to $218.24 in regular trading on Monday.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nAnother factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Apple (AAPL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AAPL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nApple's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Apple's main business drivers.\nApple\u2019s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio that includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services now became the cash cow.Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod gained significant traction. In fact, Apple dominates the Wearables and Hearables markets due to the growing adoption of Watch and AirPods. Solid uptake of Apple Watch also helped Apple strengthen its presence in the personal health monitoring space.Apple is expanding non-iPhone portfolio with the launch of Apple Vision Pro a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world.Headquartered in Cupertino, CA, Apple also designs, manufactures and sells iPad, MacBookand HomePod. These devices are powered by software applications including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems.Apple\u2019s other services include subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, new Apple TV app, Apple TV channels and Apple TV+, a new subscription service.In fiscal 2023, Apple generated $383.29 billion in total revenues. The company\u2019s flagship device iPhone accounted for 52.3% of total revenues. Services, Mac and iPad category contributed 22.2%, 7.7% and 7.4%, respectively. Wearables, Home and Accessories products category contributed 10.4%.Apple primarily reports revenues on a geographic basis, namely the Americas (North & South America), Europe (European countries, India, Middle East and Africa), Greater China (China, Hong Kong & Taiwan), Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific (Australia & other Asian Countries).In fiscal 2023, Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific accounted for 42.4%, 24.6%, 18.9%, 6.3% and 7.7% of total revenues, respectively.Apple faces stiff competition from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Google, Huawei and Motorola in the smartphone market. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer and Asus are its primary competitors in the PC market. Other notable competitors are Google & Amazon (smart speakers) and Fitbit & Xiaomi (wearables).\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Apple ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2014 would be worth $9,495.93, or an 849.59% gain, as of July 19, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 180.28% and gold's return of 79.01% over the same time frame.\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for AAPL.\nApple\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%. Apple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve. Moreover, Apple is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple\u2019s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 6.92%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) ended the recent trading session at $234.41, demonstrating a +1.68% swing from the preceding day's closing price. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.28%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.53%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.4%.\nHeading into today, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had gained 8.49% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.78% in that time.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on August 1, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.33, reflecting a 5.56% increase from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $83.75 billion, indicating a 2.38% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.59 per share and a revenue of $386.4 billion, demonstrating changes of +7.5% and +0.81%, respectively, from the preceding year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.17% higher. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nLooking at its valuation, Apple is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 34.98. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 11.53 of its industry.\nInvestors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.8 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Mini computers was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.34 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 19, placing it within the top 8% of over 250 industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nTo follow AAPL in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.62 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 30 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 10% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AAPL\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs AAPL Worth Investing In?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $6.59.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Apple.

        "Author": "  KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The European Union on Thursday accepted Apple\u2019s pledge to open its \u201ctap to pay\u201d iPhone payment system to rivals as a way to resolve an antitrust case and head off a potentially hefty fine.\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, said it approved the commitments that Apple offered earlier this year and will make them legally binding.\nRegulators had accused Apple in 2022 of abusing its dominant position by limiting access to its mobile payment technology.\nApple responded by proposing in January to allow third-party mobile wallet and payment service providers access to the contactless payment function in its iOS operating system. After Apple tweaked its proposals following testing and feedback, the commission said those \u201cfinal commitments\u201d would address its competition concerns.\n\u201cToday's commitments end our Apple Pay investigation,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for competition policy, told a press briefing in Brussels. \u201cThe commitments bring important changes to how Apple operates in Europe to the benefit of competitors and customers.\u201d\nCompetition watchdogs on both sides of the Atlantic have been investigating Apple\u2019s payment tech. A sweeping Justice Department lawsuit filed in March accuses the company of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones, including charges that it limits access to contactless payment for third-party digital wallets.\nThe EU deal promises more choice for Europeans. Vestager said iPhone users will be able to set a default wallet of their choice while mobile wallet developers will be able to use important iPhone verification functions like Face ID.\nMobile wallets rely on near-field communication, or NFC, which uses a chip to wirelessly communicate with a merchant\u2019s payment terminal.\nThe commission had charged the company with denying others access to Apple Pay, which it said is the biggest NFC-based mobile wallet on the market.\nAnalysts said there would big financial incentives for companies to use their own wallets rather than letting Apple act as the middleman, resulting in savings that could trickle down to consumers. Apple charges banks 0.15% for each credit card transaction that goes through Apple Pay, according to the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit.\n\"The main advantage to the issuer bank of supporting an alternative to Apple Pay via iPhone is the reduction in fees incurred, which can be substantial,\" said Philip Benton, a principal analyst at research and advisory firm Omdia. To encourage iPhone users to switch away from Apple Pay to another mobile wallet, \u201cthe fee reduction needs to be partially passed onto the consumer\" through benefits like cashback or loyalty rewards, he said.\nBanks and consumers could also benefit in other ways.\nIf companies use their own apps for tap-and-go payments, they would get \u201cfull visibility\u201d of their customers\u2019 transactions, said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. That data would allow them to \u201cbuild brand loyalty and trust and offer more personalised services, rewards, and promotions directly to the user,\" he said\nApple must open up its payment system in the EU's 27 countries plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein by July 25.\n\u201cAs of this date, developers will be able to offer a mobile wallet on the iPhone with the same \u2018tap and go\u2019 experience that so far has been reserved for Apple Pay,\" Vestager said.\nThe changes will remain in force for a decade and will be monitored by a trustee.\nApple said in a prepared statement that it is \"providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and contactless transactions\" for uses like car keys, corporate badges, hotel keys, and concert tickets.\nBreaches of EU competition law can draw fines worth up to 10% of a company\u2019s annual global revenue, which in Apple\u2019s case, could have amounted to tens of billions of euros (dollars).\n"

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of 1.32%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $85.78 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.59%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $81.8 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nApple shares have added about 15.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 15.8%.\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.55 on $93.04 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.61 on $388.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the top 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nDell Technologies (DELL), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 29.\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27%.

The company notes you can only roll back to an older software on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You'll have to stick with the beta version on the Apple Watch until iOS 18 officially rolls out in the fall.\nOne feature we're particularly excited to try in the iOS 18 beta is the ability to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to Siri by nodding your head while wearing AirPods Pros (you'll need the 2nd generation for this one). This feature was unveiled during Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference in June.\nAnother feature that caught everyone's attention during WWDC was Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker's answer to our current AI craze. It will not be available in today's public beta release. When it does come out, it will be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/without-apple-intelligence-ios-18-beta-feels-like-a-tv-show-thats-waiting-for-the-finaleThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/apples-public-betas-for-ios-18-are-here-to-test-out/\n"

        "Title": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Now or Wait for a Dip?",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock never seems to stay down for long. While it was struggling in the early part of the year, shares of the iPhone maker are now up more than 20% year to date. The stock is trading at a new all-time high, and with a market cap of around $3.6 trillion, Apple is back to being the most valuable company in the world.\nBut it brings up the question of whether or not the stock has become too expensive. Is it too late to invest in Apple right now, or does it still look like a good buy, even at its current levels?\nDue to the recent surge in price, shares of Apple are now trading at more than 36 times the company's trailing earnings. Over the past 10 years, the stock has averaged a much more modest earnings multiple of less than 22.\nPaying more than 35 times earnings is by no means unheard for growth stocks, but it does, however, leave investors without much of a margin of safety.\nAnd normally, for these types of stocks, the underlying businesses are growing at a fast rate. Apple, however, has recently struggled to generate much in the way of growth. During the first three months of the year, the company's quarterly revenue of $90.8 billion was down 4% year over year.\nOne reason investors are willing to look past its slowing top line, however, is due to the boost Apple is likely to receive from artificial intelligence (AI).\nFor a while, there were question marks about what Apple's strategy would look like for AI. And now, there is much more clarity about that as the company recently unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will run locally on a device, and users will have control over what, if anything, gets sent to the cloud. The AI will help with writing, creating images, and balancing tasks and meetings.\nThe rollout of new AI-powered iPhones could be what the company needs to beef up its growth rate, and that's certainly what investors are likely banking on given the surge in Apple's stock price in recent weeks. But it may take a while for investors to see the benefit of this as it's not likely until next year that the company fully releases all of its AI features.\nAnalysts have also been bullish on Apple's growth prospects, with many of them recently updating and raising their price targets for the stock. But with a consensus analyst price target of just under $224, which is below where the stock trades at today, Apple still looks expensive even when factoring in those upgrades.\nApple is one of the top consumer tech companies in the world, but there's no denying that you're paying a big premium to own a share of the business. If you're willing to buy and hold for not only years but decades, then it can certainly still be a good investment to hang on to, but if that's not the case, you may want to consider buying cheaper growth stocks that may possess more upside in the near term.\nOverall, the company has built up a strong customer base over the years, and with an expanding ecosystem of services, there's still a lot more room for the business to get bigger and more valuable. It's usually never a bad idea to invest in Apple for the long term, but with its high valuation, it could take a while to earn a high return from the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $774,281!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Apple has fallen out of the top 5 ranking of smartphone vendors in China, according to data trackers, marking the first time in years the iPhone maker has fallen so low in one of its most important markets.\niPhone shipments in China in the three months ended June declined 2 per cent year on year, bumping Apple down to No 6 on Canalys' list of top vendors by shipments, putting it behind Vivo, Oppo, Honor, Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi, according to a report from the market research firm on Thursday.\n\"It is the first quarter in history that domestic vendors dominate all the top five positions,\" Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong wrote. \"Conversely, Apple is facing a bottleneck in mainland China.\"\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Reuters>\nThe Chinese smartphone market, the world's largest, is extremely competitive, with the top six brands competing for roughly 95 per cent of the market. Apple is the last foreign brand standing in this group after Samsung Electronics lost relevance.\niPhone sales have been slumping in China this year amid fierce competition from local vendors, including Huawei, which has experienced a resurgence in the higher-end smartphone market thanks to an advanced processor produced entirely in China that has ignited patriotic fervour at home.\n\"In the first half of the year, Huawei was the leader in the market despite the US trade restrictions, further closing the gap with Apple in the >US$600 segment,\" research firm IDC's senior analyst Arthur Guo wrote in a report published on Friday.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\nHuawei, Vivo and Xiaomi all saw double-digit year-on-year growth in the second quarter, according to both Canalys and IDC.\nWhile the Android smartphone market in China grew 11.1 per cent, Apple shipments this quarter decreased 3.1 per cent from the same period a year ago, despite promotions that helped improve iPhone demand in the country, according to IDC, which also ranked Apple 6th in market share for the quarter.\nAccording to IDC's data, Apple last dipped out of the top five in the third quarter of 2020, Guo said in response to written questions.\nA separate report from research firm Counterpoint that tracks sales instead of shipments offered a rosier outlook for Apple, placing the iPhone maker at No 2 in China for the quarter with a market share of 15.5 per cent. It was closely trailed by Huawei at 15.4 per cent, Xiaomi at 15.3 per cent, and Honor at 15.2 per cent.\n\"Despite a single-digit year-on-year decline, Apple's performance in the second quarter remains impressive,\" said Counterpoint senior analyst Ivan Lam. \"However, Apple is expected to experience a traditional slump in the third quarter, as consumers awaiting the release of the iPhone 16 may delay their upgrades.\"\nApple this year has repeatedly offered discounts, as steep as 23 per cent at one point, through local retailers. It is an important market for the tech giant, which has been trying to navigate the choppy waters of increasing tensions between the US and China.\nApple chief operating officer Jeff Williams visited China this week, meeting with officials in Beijing and Shenzhen, where he pledged to deepen the Cupertino, California-headquartered tech giant's cooperation with the country.\nIn Beijing, Williams was among American executives who met with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday as part of the first US business delegation to visit China after a key Communist Party meeting this month, which also included executives from FedEx and Micron.\nWilliams also met with Meng Fanli, Shenzhen's Communist Party secretary. The executive reportedly told Meng that Apple would increase its investment in the southern Chinese tech hub, praising the city's smartphone supply chain.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, August 1, with investors likely to be watching for sales results in the China region and updates related to artificial intelligence (AI).\nHowever, according to Loop Capital, AI isn't the only significant growth driver for the tech giant; the firm\u2019s analysts also see Apple's Services segment \"skyrocketing.\"\nMore concretely, analysts emphasize the importance of Apple Music, Apple TV, and iCloud, projecting substantial revenue increases for these products in the coming years.\nApple Music currently generates $9.2 billion in revenue and is expected to grow further. Similarly, iCloud, which stands at $8 billion, \u201cis primed for massive growth\u201d driven by AI, Vision Pro, and more data-intensive apps, games, and video content, analysts noted.\nMoreover, Apple TV, with nearly 125 million subscribers, generated just under $1 billion in the past year. According to Loop analysts, the growth opportunity within this service is \u201cmassive.\u201d\n\u201cWe expect content gains mainly through acquisition to drive the Apple TV growth,\u201d they noted.\nAnalysts also highlighted Apple News, which currently commands about $1.3 billion annually, and has an $8 billion total addressable market (TAM).\nOverall, Loop Capital\u2019s analysis suggests that by 2030, the TAM for Apple\u2019s Services could reach $391 billion, out of a total company TAM of $1.659 trillion. For comparison, the current TAM for Apple\u2019s services sits at around $209 billion.\nStill, the iPhone remains a cornerstone of Apple's product lineup, analysts said.\nThe upcoming iPhone 16 and 17 cycles are expected to benefit from the integration of AI, which will push consumers towards new devices as refurbished and older models will lag in performance.\nThe firm forecasts Apple\u2019s total revenue to surpass $500 billion in the next 3-4 years, with iPhones accounting for roughly half of this amount.\nBeyond the iPhone, Loop Capital also stressed the importance of Apple\u2019s custom AI chip, which is expected to have \u201cmajor implications in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\nIn addition, the investment bank points to the resurgence of other devices like the Mac and iPad, which are recovering from sales slumps post-pandemic, aided by new designs and increased integration across Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\nRelated Articles\nAI not only driver for Apple, services seen skyrocketing: Loop Capital\nEarnings call: Shionogi reports mixed results, optimistic on pipeline progress\nEarnings call: DiaSorin reports growth and raises 2024 guidance\n"

        "Text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nShowing up late to a party has its upsides. Just ask Apple.\nWhile Tim Cook's first-mover peers were stumbling through botched AI rollouts, boardroom drama, and a public backlash, he waltzed through the door carrying an Apple Intelligence casserole and Wall Street analysts were ready with a drink.\nOn Monday the company hit an all-time high as Morgan Stanley named Apple a top pick. It raised its price target on an expected mega upgrade cycle driven by Apple's coming AI platform.\n\"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.\nThat Apple's yet-to-be-released AI tools will be available to only 8% of existing iPhone and iPad users strengthens the case for an abnormally large upgrade cycle, they said. Add in an already enormous user base and a replacement cycle that has stretched to almost five years, and there's a recipe for a lot of people itching for new devices.\nThat's a testament to Apple's AI strategy and the clever ways it has presented what AI tools can do for you. By relentlessly highlighting everyday use cases, Apple has managed to wrangle the more hysterical promises of AI into something approachable (and monetizable) inside its ecosystem.\nPrior to Apple's AI run-up, Cupertino skeptics pointed to the public's upgrade fatigue, slowing iPhone growth, and the saturated smartphone market in the US. Recent hardware releases also prompted grumblings of a lack of pizzazz, feeding a narrative that Apple's glory days were behind it.\nWhen the company ended its electric car project in February, it seemed Apple was giving up on a daring initiative and giving in to the AI fad. But that inflection point looks different now. With more insight into Cook's AI services-oriented approach, the company's AI strategy looks less like Google and Microsoft's and more like an extension of its walled garden.\nLoop Capital likened Apple's AI potential to prior generational shifts in technology.\nTwenty years ago, the iPod was the platform through which many consumers experienced digital content. Next came the iPhone, which of course was also \"late,\" but redefined the category as the iconic device became the foundation for social media.\nAnd now, through generative AI, managing director Ananda Baruah wrote on Tuesday that Apple's AI platform will become the \"base camp\" of choice for consumers.\nWhat's striking about Wall Street's outpouring of support, however, is that Apple never really transcended the hardware trap its critics claimed had ensnared it. While AI technology and its use cases may seem revolutionary, the business implications for Apple are all too conventional: People will buy more phones.\nThat's no world-changing paradigm shift. But it's a reliable way to make money.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": "  Mark Gurman ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will get an observer role on OpenAI\u2019s board as part of a landmark agreement announced last month, further tightening ties between the once-unlikely partners.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMicrosoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android\nBiden\u2019s Biggest Donors Left Powerless to Sway Him to End Bid\nZyn Imitators Rush In as Online Sales Halt Worsens US Shortage\nBoeing to Plead Guilty to Fraud for Violating Deal Over 737 Max Crashes\nBiden Narrows Gap With Trump in Swing States Despite Debate Loss\nPhil Schiller, the head of Apple\u2019s App Store and its former marketing chief, was chosen for the position, according to people familiar with the situation. As a board observer, he won\u2019t be serving as a full-fledged director, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn\u2019t public.\nThe move follows Apple\u2019s announcement in June that it would offer ChatGPT in the iPhone, iPad and Mac as part of a suite of artificial intelligence features. The board arrangement will take effect later this year, and Schiller hasn\u2019t yet attended any meetings, according to the people. Details of the situation could still change.\nThe board observer role will put Apple on par with Microsoft Corp., OpenAI\u2019s biggest backer and its main AI technology provider. The job allows someone to attend board meetings without being able to vote or exercise other director powers. Observers, however, do gain insights into how decisions are made at the company.\nRepresentatives for Apple and OpenAI declined to comment.\nHaving Microsoft and Apple sit in on board meetings could create complications for the tech giants, which have been rivals and partners over the decades. Some OpenAI board meetings will likely discuss future AI initiatives between OpenAI and Microsoft \u2014 deliberations that the latter company may want Schiller excluded from. Board observers often do oblige and exit meetings during discussions that are seen as sensitive.\nThough Schiller doesn\u2019t lead Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence initiatives, his veteran role as a steward of the company\u2019s brand makes him well-suited to the observer job. The 64-year-old stepped down as head of marketing in 2020, and his current title is Apple Fellow. In addition to overseeing the App Store, he still manages the company\u2019s product launch events. Outside of Apple, he\u2019s a director at medical technology company Illumina Inc.\nWith the OpenAI partnership, Apple is teaming up with the biggest and most influential AI startup \u2014 but also a business known for controversy and upheaval. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman was briefly ousted last year over concerns that he wasn\u2019t candid enough with the board. The company also has drawn criticism for downplaying AI safety fears and using a digital voice that sounded similar to actress Scarlett Johansson without an agreement.\nThe OpenAI integration is one component of Apple\u2019s overall AI strategy, which also includes in-house features. Its technology \u2014 called Apple Intelligence \u2014 summarizes articles and notifications, creates custom emojis and images, and transcribes voice memos. The effort also includes a revamped version of Apple\u2019s Siri digital assistant, but many of those enhancements won\u2019t arrive until next year.\nApple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI isn\u2019t a financial arrangement, at least for now. Instead of money changing hands, OpenAI is getting access to hundreds of millions of potential users. For its part, Apple gains a chatbot feature that many consumers are clamoring for. Users also will be able to access a paid version of ChatGPT on Apple devices, and that could generate App Store fees for the iPhone maker.\nApple remains in discussions with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and startup Anthropic about offering additional chatbots to customers. It\u2019s also discussing potential agreements with Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to bring its AI features to devices in China. Apple Intelligence will launch initially in American English before an international rollout.\nTop Apple executives frequently serve as directors of other companies, but joining the board of a high-profile partner is rare. Apple, did, however, briefly hold a board seat at DiDi Global Inc. after investing $1 billion in the China-based Uber rival.\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving\nPsychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch\nThe Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded\nHow Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Mac computer sales rose 3% to $7 billion.\nThe only region that showed a decline in net sales was Greater China, which continues the tech company\u2019s struggles there. The Chinese government has expressed concerns about the security of Apple devices and China represents almost a fifth of Apple\u2019s overall net sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that more than 50% of the decline in the most-recent quarter year-over-year was currency-related, which was \u201can improvement\u201d from the first half of the fiscal year.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re happy to see the acceleration,\u201d Cook said, adding the company remained \u201cconfident in the long-term opportunity\u201d in the competitive market.\nOn Thursday, Cook touted the success of AppleTV+ productions, which scored 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs, the best-ever showing for the streaming arm.\n\u201cApple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens, large and small, we\u2019re sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d the upcoming \u201cDisclaimer\u201d and \u201dThe Instigators\u201d starring Matt Damon,\u201d the tech company\u2019s CEO said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d \u201cSlow Horses\u201d and \u201dSeverance.\u201d\nDuring the quarter, Apple\u2019s EPS growth of 11% and nearly $29 billion in operating cash flow allowed the the tech giant to return more than $32 billion to shareholders, Apple\u2019s CFO Luca Maestri said. \u201cWe are also very pleased that our installed base of active devices reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.\u201d\nWhat Wall Street was more interested in further understanding about Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s company-wide AI initiative. Cook promised that Apple \u201cwill continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential.\u201d\nApple officially jumped into the AI arms race in June when it unveiled its plans for integrating AI technology into its products, including a partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Apple\u2019s intends to integrate machine learning capabilities across all of the company\u2019s product offerings, including Siri.\nBut like its rivals, including Meta Platforms, Apple is struggling to explain how it will monetize the new technology \u2014 and what the timetable is to realize a return on investment.\nThe integration \u201cbuilds on years of innovation and investment in AI and machine learning, it will transform how users interact with technology,\u201d Cook said Thursday. He added that it was \u201ca breakthrough personal intelligence system that puts powerful, private generative AI models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\u201d\nChatGPT integration will be coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and MacOS later this year, the company said during June\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The function will serve as an extension of Apple Intelligence, providing further \u201cexpertise\u201d details from the OpenAI chatbot with user control over whether they want to share data to use the function.\nApple also noted it intends to expand further by partnering with more AI companies in the future.\nThe post Apple Reports Record Q3 Revenue of $85.8 Billion, With AI Expansion on the Horizon appeared first on TheWrap.\n"

        "Text": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\u00a0is reportedly reconsidering plans to manufacture\u00a0iPads\u00a0in India, driven by the government\u2019s initiative to attract more supply chains to the country. The tech giant is also said to be eyeing Pune for producing AirPod cases.\nWhat Happened: Apple will likely resume its search for a manufacturing partner in India after its previous attempt to collaborate with China\u2019s\u00a0BYD\u00a0for iPad production in the country was stopped short by government restrictions, Moneycontrol said citing sources.\nIn addition to ramping up its iPhone manufacturing capabilities, Apple is also making efforts to increase the production of components for AirPod wireless charging cases through\u00a0Jabil\u00a0in India. The company reportedly plans to start production of true wireless stereo (TWS) AirPods, in India from early next year.\nApple has initiated trial production of components for wireless charging cases in Pune with Jabil and is considering a similar arrangement with Taiwan\u2019s\u00a0Foxconn.

The company has reportedly shared ambitious plans for the Indian market for the next two to three years, including establishing an alternate supply chain in the country.\nLast year, Apple redirected its iPad product development efforts to Vietnam in collaboration with BYD, following challenges in securing approvals for establishing iPad manufacturing operations in India.\nApple is ramping up local production of its flagship iPhone models in India with Foxconn and\u00a0Tata Electronics. The goal is to manufacture a significant portion, targeting a quarter of all iPhones in India within the next three to four years.\nThis development is expected to boost the local manufacturing ecosystem, create jobs and contribute to the Indian economy.

        "Text": "Apple is finally releasing some of the Apple Intelligence features it announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\nHowever, the rollout is currently restricted to developer beta versions of iOS 18.1. So if you don't want to deal with early-stage buggy software, you might want to wait for the Apple Intelligence feature release of public betas or the stable release later this year.\nIf you are on the developer beta, you can only use Apple Intelligence features if your language is set to U.S. English and your region is set to U.S. This doesn't affect your App Store regions or purchases.\nHere is how you can start using Apple Intelligence features:\nOpen the Settings app.\nGo to the Apple Intelligence & Siri menu.\nTap on the \"Join the Apple Intelligence waitlist\" option.\nOnce your waitlist position is approved, you will get a notification. It might take a while for the system to download all models and data necessary to run Apple Intelligence. You can toggle off the Apple Intelligence feature from the menu at any point in time.\nApple's AI suite features work through a combination of on-device and Apple Private Cloud requests. Apple said that the waitlist is to ensure sufficient service capacity.\nAt the moment, Apple Intelligence is only compatible with iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs that run on M1 chips.\nNew Siri: Apple Intelligence-powered Siri has a new animation. Plus, you can always double tap on the bottom bar to text Siri when you are in a loud place or a meeting. Siri can also handle stumbling words, so when you say, \"Hey Siri, set a 10-minute, no, 15-minute timer,\" it will set a 15-minute timer.\nHow-to questions: You can also ask Siri about Apple's system-related how-tos such as \"How do I take a screen recording?\"\nWriting tools: You can now reformat any text across the system. You can use \"Proofread\" to check for spelling mistakes or grammatical errors and \"Rewrite\" to rewrite the selected text without changing the meaning a lot. You can also choose to change the tone of the text through three options: \"Friendly,\" \"Professional\" or \"Concise.\" You can summarize the text to generate a list, key points or a table.\nMail app: The Mail app now shows summaries of emails in one line without opening them. Apple Intelligence also shows important emails on top of the inbox. Plus, you can use AI-generated smart replies to quickly respond to emails.\nPhotos: You can now search for photos through natural language queries. Additionally, you can also create memories via prompts.\nNotification summaries: Apple Intelligence also shows summaries of some mail and message notifications.\nCall transcriptions: Apple Intelligence now powers call recording with the tap of a button. The recordings are stored under a new \"Call Recordings\" folder in the Notes app.\nNotes app audio support: You can also record and transcribe audio directly into the Notes app. Apple's AI suite will also automatically produce a summary.\nApple Intelligence doesn't yet have features such as the ability to remove unwanted objects in photos, emoji, image playground, and ChatGPT interactions. There is no fixed timeline for when we will get to test these features.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/how-to-enable-apple-intelligence-on-your-iphone/\n"

        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the few companies worldwide to have gone over the $3 trillion mark. It has made fortunes for its founders and early investors, but it can also put money in your pocket. The most obvious way to earn money from investing in Apple is through capital appreciation, but it does pay a modest dividend. However, be warned: It will take a lot of Apple stock to put any dividend income in your pocket.\nApple Inc.\u2019s 52-week price range was $164.08 to $237.23. Its dividend yield is 0.43%. It paid $0.96 in dividends during the past year. As of this writing, the stock has risen 20% over the past year and over the past five years by over 340%. That's not too shabby for a company of its size.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nThis property type is nearly recession-proof \u2014 see passive income real estate deals for accredited investors.\nThe CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY.\nOne theory of investing says that when a big company starts paying dividends, its best years may be behind it. We don't subscribe to that theory, but the market is waiting for Apple to build on its reputation for innovation. The most recent iterations of the iPhone have attracted sales but not the fan frenzy that earlier launches generated. During the most recent quarter, iPhone sales dropped by 10%. The Apple Watch is popular but hasn't become a must-have device to the same level as the iPhone.\nSome company watchers say that Apple has too much riding on the Vision Pro, which has a steep price tag and hasn't taken off the way many betting on virtual reality would have expected. Apple recently announced a new lineup of immersive videos and movies made specifically for the Vision Pro. We can expect to hear much more about the Vision Pro from CEO Tim Cook at the next earnings call on August 1.\nOne area where Apple is seeing growth is in its services area. Apple is bringing more content to its entertainment offerings, including live sports. We could also see it delve more deeply into artificial intelligence. While skeptics say Apple is too late to the generative AI party, its advantage is that it owns the devices that most of us use to interact with AI. Apple has the potential to surprise the world, but missteps, like a foray into self-driving cars, are cause for concern.\nCheck It Out: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\nLet's get back to the money. If you want consistent $500\u00a0 income from Apple, the bad news is you already need to have achieved millionaire status. To earn $500 per month \u2014 $6,000 annually \u2014 from Apple\u2019s dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $1,395,349, which is 6,222 shares at $224.27 each. Alternatively, to earn $100 per month, your investment value drops to $279,070 or 1,244 shares.\nHere's how to do the dividend yield calculations: When making an estimate, you need two key variables \u2014 the desired annual income ($6,000) and the dividend yield (0.43% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0043 = $1,395,349 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0043 = $279,070 for $100 per month.\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock\u2019s current price. For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as a yearly dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\nInvesting in Apple Inc. can provide a stable monthly income, but you'd have to outlay significant cash that might be better deployed across multiple opportunities. While Apple has performed very well as a stock, past performance doesn't mean the company can deliver again. It\u2019s important to consider market volatility and the potential for dividend changes. And we never like to have our eggs all in one basket; exploring ETFs, bonds,\u00a0 mutual funds, and private investing opportunities can offer diversified income streams with potentially lower risks.\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over 2 years starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "Text": "Apple introduced its AI-powered digital assistant Siri in 2011, and people have been asking it to answer questions and perform simple tasks ever since. As Siri enters its teens, it\u2019s getting a significant upgrade as Apple integrates Apple Intelligence into its next iOS and macOS releases, making Siri more intelligent, helpful and productive. Here is an overview of some of the new features and functionality you can expect.\nAll of the following features and tools can save you time \u2014 and, as the saying goes, time is money. These AI options may not all directly help you save money, but they can all make you more efficient, from your personal budget to running your business.\nLearn More: 6 Things the Middle Class Should Sell To Build Their Savings\nCheck Out: 6 Unusual Ways to Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\nWhether using Apple Mail, Pages or Notes, Apple Intelligence can help you rewrite, proofread and summarize emails and documents. It can even help you change the tone of your writing or inject humor. If you need to create original content, the Compose feature of Writing Tools will use ChatGPT to do it for you. You can also use Apple Writing Tools with many third-party apps.\nWhen taking notes during a business call or listening to a recording on your Apple device, you can record it with the Phone or Notes app and ask Siri to act as your transcriptionist \u2014 it can summarize the transcript and give you the highlights.\nThis could be a particularly useful tool if you have a business or side gig that includes communicating with customers or sending pitches to potential clients but aren\u2019t confident in your writing skills. Instead of paying someone else to do it, you can have the AI write what you need.\nRead Next: 6 Valuable Everyday Items You Should Never Throw Away\nNot only can Siri help you write better, it can generate images for you, too. Are you writing a presentation using the Notes app? Use the Image Wand feature to have Siri create visuals based on the text or a rough sketch. Or use Image Playground in your Apple apps to create images based on a concept or description.\nSimilarly to the writing tool, this can help you avoid paying for an artist to create images for your business if you can\u2019t afford the personal touch they can offer.\nIf you have trouble keeping up with email, Apple Intelligence can help you stay better organized. It provides quick access to the most critical emails in the Mail app and automatically reminds you of time-sensitive emails. Apple Intelligence can also group emails by senders and create snippets for quick scanning.\nApple Intelligence can also help you manage phone notifications by prioritizing the most important ones and summarizing them for easy scanning. The Reduce Interruptions feature can determine which notifications you need to view immediately and which can wait for later.\nAmong other possible uses, the reminders of time-sensitive information could help you avoid missing bill payments, which would in turn save you money on late fees.\nYou no longer have to worry about whether it is too late at night or early in the morning to send text messages. Write them whenever it is most convenient for you and use the Send Later feature to schedule delivery at a more appropriate time.\nBeyond being useful to avoid disturbing your friends and family in the middle of the night, this would allow you to use your time the way it\u2019s most efficient for you \u2014 and possibly save you some money by leaving yourself time during the day to handle other things.\nThe iPad is finally getting an updated scientific calculator. You can use a keyboard or an Apple Pencil to write an equation or evaluate an expression in the Math Notes app, and the Calculator app will solve it as soon as you type or write the equals sign. You can also plot graphs via Math Notes.\nThis could offer you a serious budget upgrade \u2014 and having your finances laid out more clearly would allow you to see areas you might be overspending on.\nIf you\u2019re performing online research, Safari Reader can provide a summary and table of contents for articles or web pages as you browse to help you evaluate whether a source is worth reading. Safari can also detect and highlight pertinent information pages, allowing you to find what you need quickly.\nOne of the many useful money-related ways you could use this function is improving your own financial literacy \u2014 the more you understand your money, the more effectively you can use it, and Safari Reader could help you learn more efficiently.\nAccording to Apple, Apple Intelligence will eventually allow Siri to perform actions across most apps with a simple voice or typed command, such as asking Siri to find a specific document on your phone and email or text it to particular contacts. Or imagine saying, \u201cHey Siri, deduct $20 from the miscellaneous category of my budget, and tell me how much I have left to spend this month.\u201d\nAs Apple continues improving its AI options and cross-app compatibility, Siri may eventually simplify everything from managing your household or small business to staying on top of your finances, all using voice commands.\nApple says Apple Intelligence is part of the iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia releases scheduled this fall, although not all AI features will immediately be available. To experience Siri\u2019s new AI smarts, you\u2019ll also need an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, iPad or Mac with M1 and later, set to U.S. English.\nAmber Barkley contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n3 Reasons You Should Not Buy a House When You Retire\nHow To Borrow Money from Cash App: Your Step-by-Step Guide\n3 Things to Do This Week If You Have Debt\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Ways Apple\u2019s New AI Options Can Save You Time and Money\n"

        "Text": "Shares in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have risen 8% over the last month, hitting an all-time high of $237 per share in mid-July. The company's stock has outperformed many of the most prominent names in artificial intelligence (AI), including Microsoft, Alphabet, and even Nvidia. Apple's growth is a welcome turnaround after facing a slump in the first half of the year.\nThis chart illustrates how, up until June, Apple's share price had fallen while many of its rivals enjoyed solid gains. The disparity was largely because Apple had yet to display any encouraging growth in AI. However, that changed on June 10 when the company announced Apple Intelligence, a software overhaul that will bring AI features across its product lineup.\nAs a result, recent stock growth shows Apple playing catch-up after a delayed start in the industry. Wall Street is growing increasingly bullish in the lead-up to September when the tech giant will unveil its first iPhone designed with AI in mind.\nHere's why I'm doubling down on Apple despite its share price hitting a new peak this month.\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 triggered an AI rally that has yet to loosen its grip on Wall Street. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has climbed 31% in the last 12 months, driven mainly by excitement over AI. For reference, the S&P 500 rose by 24% during that period.\nTech giants like Nvidia and Alphabet delivered stock growth of 159% and 44%, respectively, since last July as they've rallied investors with new AI products. Comparatively, Apple's share price has risen 20%. The iPhone maker has taken a more gradual approach to AI, which has led to slower stock gains. However, the company appears to be ramping up its expansion into the arena, suggesting now could be an excellent time to invest before it's too late.\nSeptember is shaping up to be a critical month for Apple, with the release of Apple Intelligence and the company's latest iPhone. Apple Intelligence will bring new features like image and language-generation tools, photo updates, and a complete overhaul of its smart assistant, Siri. However, Apple has strategically made its AI upgrades only available on its newest products.\nAs a result, consumers will need an iPhone 15 Pro or higher to access Apple Intelligence through a smartphone. Meanwhile, iPads and Macs must be running the company's M1 through M4 chips. Apple's iPhone 16 launch in September is coming at the perfect time and could lead to a rush of smartphone updates by consumers.\nApple's product line has slumped over the last year, facing repeated sales declines. However, the company is now utilizing AI to encourage shoppers to upgrade their devices. Apple's stock has already begun trickling up since June, but it is still a long way from seeing the growth its peers have enjoyed from AI. Consequently, Apple's shares are a compelling buy right now, with plenty of room to run.\nAccording to the chart above, Apple's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio has decreased 98% over the last year to about 4.\nPEG is a helpful valuation metric as it uniquely accounts for a company's growth prospects. It is calculated by dividing its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) by its earnings-per-share growth rate over time. Generally, the lower the PEG, the better the value.\nSo, despite rises in its share price, Apple's stock has actually increased in value over the last year. Its lower PEG suggests its stock is trading at a bargain and at one of its best-valued positions in months.\nThe decline in PEG aligns with Apple's significant potential for the rest of 2024. In addition to AI, Apple has a booming services business. Its digital-services segment includes income from the App Store and subscription-based services like Apple TV+ and Music. In the second quarter of 2024, the services segment posted revenue gains of 14% year over year, beating all of Apple's other divisions in growth. Meanwhile, it hit a profit margin of 75%. For reference, Apple's products achieved a profit margin of 37%.\nApple had a challenging start to the year but appears to be back on a promising growth trajectory, which is why I'm doubling down on its stock this month.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The exclusion of the much-anticipated Apple Intelligence suite from China's market could weigh on iPhone sales in the country, analysts said, especially after the US tech giant dropped out of the mainland's top-five smartphone brand list in the second quarter.\nFollowing the debut of Apple Intelligence's beta version on its newly released iOS 18.1, Chinese users expressed disappointment that the highly anticipated suite of artificial intelligence (AI) features is not yet available in their market. The beta version is limited to American users as it requires them to set the language of the device and voice assistant Siri to US English, and the device region to the US, which excludes China and the EU.\nNetizens on Chinese social media platform Weibo are taking a wait-and-see approach, with many searching for ways to bypass Apple's restrictions. One Chinese user on X, formerly Twitter, wrote on Tuesday that it won't be necessary to have the \"fear of missing out\" as everyone \"inside the Great Firewall ... is subject to this kind of experience downgrade\".\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Bloomberg>\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about its plans to launch Apple Intelligence in China.\nUncertainties are looming around how and when Apple can bring its AI features to China, as the California-based tech giant will need to tackle major challenges including Beijing's stringent regulations on large language models (LLMs) and data handling in the country.\nFulfilling its AI promises has become more pressing as Apple is losing ground in the world's biggest smartphone market. In the second quarter, Apple fell out of the top 5 rankings of smartphone vendors in China, according to data by Canalys, marking the first time in years that the iPhone maker has been out of the top 5 in one of its most important markets.\n\"Apple is facing a bottleneck in mainland China,\" Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong wrote in a report last week. \"The localisation of Apple's Intelligence services in mainland China will be crucial in the next 12 months.\"\nApple adopts a hybrid approach in its AI strategy, with a focus on privacy, promising to handle most of the AI computing on the device, and use its Private Cloud Compute system to handle more complex AI problems.\n\"For the on-device LLM developed in-house, compliance is the main challenge, with localisation being a secondary concern,\" said Zhong. \"While the issue of localisation can be resolved through model tuning, the compliance process will take time.\"\nIn China, the race to integrate generative AI features into smartphones has already escalated as major Chinese vendors, from Beijing-based Xiaomi to Guangdong-based Vivo, Oppo and Huawei Technologies, have been integrating a variety of AI-powered functions to their devices to help users write text messages, edit photos, answer calls and take notes.\nWhile Apple has partnered with Microsoft-backed OpenAI in integrating generative AI in Siri and other tools in its devices outside China, the company has yet to announce a local partner in the Chinese market where ChatGPT is not available.\n\"The potential roll-out of Apple Intelligence in China depends on its negotiations with the Chinese government,\" said Arthur Guo, a senior analyst with IDC China. \"We believe that the key difference between the China roll-out and the global version would be in its cloud-based intelligence.\"\nApple's South Korean rival Samsung Electronics, which formed a partnership with Google worldwide, also struck a deal with Baidu to provide AI capabilities for its Galaxy S24 phones in China. The Beijing-based internet search giant is also said to be in talks with Apple about a similar partnership.\nA sign for 'Galaxy AI' artificial intelligence seen at the Samsung Electronics Unpacked launch in Paris, France, on July 10, 2024.

Photo: Bloomberg>\nApple is no stranger to the need for a unique iPhone ecosystem to comply with the heavily regulated Chinese market. For example, it has ceded legal ownership of its customers' data to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, a company owned by the provincial government. Censorship rules in China also block user access to some of the world's biggest apps and services including Instagram, Google search and X in the local app store.\nCanalys' Zhong expects relatively low regulatory resistance for Apple Intelligence in China due to the company's emphasis on compliance during the model training process and its relatively transparent privacy policy.\n\"We can expect the launch of Apple Intelligence in China to boost the demand for iPhone upgrades, but the key challenge for Apple is to revitalise Chinese consumers' interest with innovative updates in the features,\" Zhong said.\nShenzhen resident Thomas Chen said he would stick with iPhones even without Apple Intelligence, as he has been in the Apple ecosystem for years. \"Currently AI has yet to enter a very intelligent stage, and it's not essential for me to have it on my phone. There are many alternative ways to access AI services that I need,\" he said.\nChina's scrutiny over generative AI technology has been tightening, with new guidelines and rules this year to ensure that AI-generated content aligns with what the government permits. Last August, China imposed detailed regulations governing domestic generative AI services, making it one of the first countries in the world to implement rules covering that emerging technology.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The first signs of Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine, \u00a0will be \u201cmore powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\u201d Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0Neural Engine is Apple\u00a0Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\nAfter the latest AI announcements at the WWDC event, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in \u201cdenial\u201d about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nApple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock\u2019s overvalued, given Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc.

Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is seeking to get a Chinese court to alter its written ruling in a lawsuit the iPhone maker won, an unusual move that underscores the sensitivity of the US company\u2019s position in the world\u2019s largest smartphone arena.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMicrosoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android\nBiden\u2019s Biggest Donors Left Powerless to Sway Him to End Bid\nZyn Imitators Rush In as Online Sales Halt Worsens US Shortage\nBoeing to Plead Guilty to Fraud for Violating Deal Over 737 Max Crashes\nRich Chinese Return to Hong Kong as Singapore Steps Up Scrutiny\nApple has filed a petition asking the Supreme People\u2019s Court to make tweaks to select sentences in a ruling that ended a dispute over the cut of app revenue it takes from most developers, according to an excerpt of the filing seen by Bloomberg News. The iPhone maker wants the nation\u2019s highest court to strike references to Apple\u2019s \u201cdominant position\u201d from a decision written by a lower court, which in May tossed out the lawsuit due to a lack of evidence. It\u2019s also objecting to a phrase suggesting \u201cunfair pricing may hurt consumers.\u201d\nApple appears to be trying to play down its market position in China, where it\u2019s often neck-and-neck with Huawei Technologies Co. and other high-end smartphone makers at the top of quarterly shipment rankings. The characterization of Apple\u2019s \u201cdominance\u201d \u2014 in an official court decision \u2014 may get cited in future filings or cases at a time when regulators globally are closely scrutinizing tech giants. At issue is the fee that Apple and its rivals charge developers for hosting their apps on the store \u2014 as high as 50% in the case of popular Android mobile games in China, versus a general 30% in much of the rest of the world.\nApple\u2019s unusual move to try and alter the language of a decision already in its favor reflects its delicate position in China \u2014 both its largest international market and biggest production base. The company is grappling with resurgent rival Huawei and the uncertainty of a ban on the use of foreign devices in many state firms and agencies. Globally, Apple and Google \u2014 which runs the Android app store \u2014 have been forced to defend app store policies to regulators in Europe and the US.\nApple is defending its fees on multiple fronts, including a lawsuit at home in the US and via challenges in Europe, South Korea and Japan. It has consistently argued its commissions are justified by the security and peace of mind that the app store provides users, while giving developers a global showcase.\nIn May, a Shanghai court dismissed a lawsuit over that practice, after ruling there was insufficient evidence to show Apple had abused its status. The plaintiff in that case accused Apple of abusing its market position, both with a 30% commission on in-app purchases and by restricting payment methods.\nAn Apple representative didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The plaintiff \u2014 surnamed Jin \u2014 submitted a separate appeal in which she argued Apple is charging a fee in China that is higher than in Europe and the US, and that the iPhone maker was suppressing transactions through its policies.\nThe ruling coincides with moves by major Chinese developers and store operators to try and change the dynamics of the domestic app ecosystem.\nIn June, Tencent Holdings Ltd. made a surprise move to pull hit game DnF Mobile off Android app stores operated by Chinese smartphone makers including Huawei and Oppo, citing unspecified \u201cadjustments\u201d in their collaborations. Tencent executives have long expressed frustration over the up-to-50% cut those app platforms take from in-game purchases.\nAt the same time, Huawei is considering taking a cut of in-app purchases on its own Harmony mobile operating system, levying a fee for the first time as its smartphones grab market share from Apple.\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving\nPsychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch\nThe Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded\nHow Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Apple reportedly in talks for an ad-supported tier of Apple TV+",
        "Author": "  Chris Morris ",
        "Text": "Apple may be looking to ad an ad-supported tier to its Apple TV+ streaming service, but U.S. users aren\u2019t likely to see any changes anytime soon.\nThe Telegraph reports Apple has met with the Broadcaster's Audience Research Board, the U.K.\u2019s television ratings organization, about bringing advertising to Apple TV+ in that country. There are no reports that the company plans to unveil an ad-supported tier in the U.S., however.\nApple did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment on the report.\nApple TV+ already has some commercials on its service, but only for live sporting events like Major League Soccer. Unlike Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and virtually every other streaming service, though, it does not offer a lower-cost ad-supported monthly option for subscribers. (Those additional offerings have proven quite popular with users, resulting in higher subscriber counts.)\nApple has taken some steps in recent months that indicate it is considering an ad-supported subscription model, however. Earlier this year, the company hired Joseph Cady, who previously servied as EVP of advanced advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. That came after a number of prominent hires of people with experience in television advertising.\nAd-supported tiers not only have boosted subscriber counts for other streaming services, they\u2019re a good source of additional revenue for the companies.\nThe news of a possible ad-supported tier comes as Apple TV+ is also reportedly talking with Paramount+ about a possible bundle of their streaming services. As subscriber churn has continued to be a problem for many streamers (and viewers have grown weary of the cost of these services), a growing number are teaming up to offer lower-priced options to consumers. Just last week, Disney+, Hulu, and Max unveiled a bundle that offered savings of up to 38% over the stand-alone pricing of those services for viewers.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Has It Worked?\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\nIn a court filing, Apple denied allegations that it is a monopolist and said it is not required to give software developers more access to iPhones than they currently have. The company has set the terms for access to its own platform and technologies, Apple argued in its filing, but hasn\u2019t interfered or restricted third parties from dealing with its smartphone rivals. Those actions can\u2019t be challenged under US antitrust law, the company said.\n\u201cApple faces robust competition from other smartphone manufacturers around the world, including Google and Samsung,\u201d company lawyers argued Thursday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.\nThe suit against the world\u2019s most-valuable company came as the Biden administration made competition a cornerstone of its economic policy, with a primary focus on Silicon Valley. Apple, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. also face possible hefty fines as the European Union investigates their compliance with strict new laws reining in the power of Big Tech.\nIn its motion to dismiss the US case, Apple argued the complaint fails to demonstrate that the company\u2019s conduct has harmed consumers \u2014 a key component of antitrust cases.\n\u201cIt is implausible to claim, as the government does, that Apple has deterred any customers from switching to Google or Samsung because of its policies with respect to \u2018super apps,\u2019 cloud gaming, smartwatches, or anything else,\u201d according to the filing.\nIn March, the US Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general sued Apple for allegedly blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices. The suit alleges Apple used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. Antitrust enforcers alleged the company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services.\n\u201cThe implausibility of the government\u2019s claim that Apple\u2019s conduct has eroded smartphone competition is underscored by the complaint\u2019s implicit recognition that the smartphone market exhibits ongoing innovation and vigorous competition,\u201d according to Apple\u2019s filing.\nIn addition to the competition Apple faces from other smartphone makers, \u201cthird-party developers are flourishing on Apple\u2019s platform, offering iPhone users a wide range of competitive choices,\u201d the company said.\nCompanies typically ask judges to dismiss antitrust cases, though they rarely succeed in cases brought by the government.\nUS District Judge Julien Neals, an appointee of President Joe Biden who joined the bench in 2021, is likely to hold a hearing on Apple\u2019s request to dismiss the case later this year.\nThe case is US v Apple, 24-cv-04055, US District Court, District of New Jersey.\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\n(Updates with details of filing)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\nForty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest\nThe Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) -Apple on Thursday asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit by federal and state antitrust regulators accusing it of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market, saying the case would have a judge redesign its popular iPhone.\nThe Justice Department, 19 states and Washington, D.C., accuse Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.\nIn a motion filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Apple argued that putting reasonable limitations on third-party developers' access to its technology did not amount to anti-competitive behavior, and forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation.\n\"Endorsing such a theory would require courts to oversee product-design and policy choices in dynamic technical markets,\" Apple said.\nThe lawsuit filed in March takes aim at Apple's restrictions and fees on app developers, and technical roadblocks to third-party devices and services -- such as smart watches, digital wallets and messaging services -- that would compete with its own.\nThe Justice Department says that by hampering interoperability between the iPhone and third-party apps and devices, Apple locks users into its own products and harms competition in the market.\nBut Apple argued that the lawsuit fails to raise any evidence that its practices harm competition or consumers, who it says plausibly switch to a competitor if they dislike what iPhone features.\nU.S. District Judge Julien Neals, who is overseeing the case, will receive a response from the government and a reply from Apple before deciding the motion later this year.\nThe case is one of five blockbuster monopoly cases pending against Big Tech companies.\nFacebook parent Meta Platforms and Amazon.com are facing lawsuits by antitrust enforcers alleging they illegally maintain monopolies, and Alphabet's Google is facing two such lawsuits.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New YorkEditing by Chris Reese and Leslie Adler)\n"

Williams reportedly told Meng that Shenzhen is an important market for Apple, which intends to deepen its cooperation with the city.\nMeng welcomed Apple to increase its local business and investment, adding that Shenzhen would strengthen its supply chain for the company to produce more mutually beneficial results, according to the Chinese readouts.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Sina>\nApple is currently ramping up production for its iPhone 16 series devices, which are expected to launch in the fall, as its contractors in China, including Foxconn Technology Group's plant in Shenzhen, are recruiting workers. While Apple has joined rival firms like Samsung Electronics in building up production capacity in countries such as Vietnam and India, China has remained a key assembly location for the iPhone maker, as no other country yet has the same level of manufacturing sophistication and scale.\nWilliams was among the US executives who met with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing on Monday as part of the first US business delegation to visit China after a key Communist Party meeting this month. The official statement on the visit did not mention Williams, but a photo published by China's foreign ministry showed him in the group.\nThe meeting between Meng and Williams came four months after the Cupertino, California-based company unveiled a plan to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen this year. The Shenzhen lab is expected to boost Apple's testing and research capabilities in developing important products such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Vision Pro, with deeper collaboration with local suppliers, according to the company.\nApple has also invested in other research and development facilities in the country. It has established R&D centres in Shanghai, Suzhou, Beijing and Shenzhen. Apple said in March that it has so far invested 1 billion yuan (US$137.5 million) in its Shanghai applied research lab, which it is expanding.\nWhile in Beijing, Williams visited an Apple Store in the Wangfujing shopping district to greet staff and customers, Isabel Ge Mahe, Apple's vice-president and managing director of Greater China, said in a Weibo post.\nHe also met with team members of Migu, China's digital entertainment service provider, who were at the store to showcase their app developed for the Apple Vision Pro, which just hit the shelves in China last month.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\nApple\u00a0shares hit a 52-week high of $220.38 on Jul 2 and finally closed at $220.27, up 14.4% year to date. Since Jun 10, when the iPhone maker hosted its annual developers\u2019 event, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple shares have jumped 14.1%, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Miniindustry\u2019s gain of 13.8% and the Zacks Computer & Technologysector\u2019s return of 5.8%.\nLately, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his enthusiasm over the opportunities with Generative AI (GenAI). In the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Cook stated that Apple enjoys a significant advantage in the AI space due to \u201cApple\u2019s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple\u2019s silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy.\u201d\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, has become more natural, contextually aware, and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri\u2019s new design features an elegant glowing light around the screen edge when active, and its functionality extends to providing device support and answering detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nIn a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri can utilize ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities, with user consent, to provide more detailed and accurate information. ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide Writing Tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\nApple\u2019s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are noteworthy. As of Mar 30, 2024, cash & marketable securities were $162.34 billion compared with term debt of $102.59 billion.\nApple returned nearly $27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 through dividend payouts ($3.7 billion) and share repurchases ($23.5 billion). Its board authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and also raised dividend payout by 4% to 25 cents per share.\nChina\u2019s growth remains a worry for Apple due to stiff competition from local smartphone makers, including Huawei. The Chinese government\u2019s directive to state officials not to use non-Chinese phones for work has been detrimental to the iPhone\u2019s demand.\nPer Canalys data, the Mainland China smartphone market witnessed 67.7 million units of shipment in first-quarter 2024. Huawei led with a 17% market share, shipping 11.7 million smartphones, while Apple sold 10 million units, down 25% year over year, the most among the top five vendors.\nThe issues forced Apple to cut retail prices, which drove iPhone smartphone shipments in April (up 52% year over year) and is also expected to have benefited May sales. However, Apple is suffering from a lack of GenAI capabilities in the iPhone.\nApple\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.75 billion, indicating 2.38% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has increased by a penny to $1.33 per share over the past 30 days.\nMoreover, Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.63X compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini industry\u2019s 28.58X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nHowever, Apple\u2019s AI push is hard to ignore. The Services business has emerged as AAPL\u2019s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple\u2019s investment profile attractive.\nMoreover, Apple shares are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\nApple currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - The former senior Apple lawyer who avoided prison time after pleading guilty to insider trading must pay a $1.15 million fine in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.\nU.S. District Judge William Martini in Newark, New Jersey, said that while Gene Levoff \"was not living excessively, his violations were nonetheless especially egregious\" given the lawyer's former role enforcing Apple's insider trading policies.\nLevoff had been senior director of corporate law at Apple before the iPhone maker fired him in September 2018.\nProsecutors charged him five months later with making stock trades based on advance nonpublic information about Cupertino, California-based Apple's earnings announcements.\nLevoff pleaded guilty to securities fraud in June 2022, and was sentenced by Martini in December to four years of probation, 2,000 hours of community service and a $604,000 forfeiture.\nThe proposed SEC fine was triple Levoff's estimated $384,400 profit or avoided losses on six trades.\nIn court papers, Levoff called the fine unnecessary, saying he had been punished enough and made no effort to hide his stress-induced trading, which he labeled \"self-sabotage.\"\nBut the judge said Levoff, a Stanford University law school graduate, knew his trading was wrong, and could handle the fine given his estimated $13 million net worth.\n\"Regardless of why he was trying to get caught, he acted knowingly and willfully,\" Martini wrote.\nKevin Marino, a lawyer for Levoff, said in an email: \"We are of course disappointed, but Judge Martini has been fair and even-handed throughout this case and we respect his decision. Mr. Levoff is pleased to put this matter behind him and move on with his life.\"\nThe case is SEC v Levoff, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 19-05536.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)\n"

        "Title": "Why Apple and other tech giants turned to dividends \u2014 \u2018They\u2019ve won\u2019",
        "Author": "  Greg McKenna ",
        "Text": "Investors raked in record dividend payments last year, and more of Big Tech is joining the party. After helping drag the market to record highs, mega caps like Meta and Alphabet have joined fellow tech giants Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia in returning cash to shareholders. While dividends may be more commonly associated with traditional value stocks, rather than market darlings helping drive the A.I. boom, analysts said the move opens these stocks to new categories of investors\u2014and utilizes cash that has few places to go.\nFacebook-parent Meta introduced a 50-cent dividend in February, which helped fuel a historic rally for the stock. Three months later, Alphabet followed suit with a dividend of 20 cents per share, sparking a 10% gain in the Google-parent\u2019s shares.\nIn doing so, the companies finally joined the likes of Microsoft, which first declared a dividend in 2003, and Apple, which reinstated its quarterly dividend in 2012 after suspending it for 17 years. In the first quarter of 2024, the latter two companies were the third- and eighth-biggest dividend payers in the world, according to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index.\nCompanies in growth-mode are typically focused on reinvesting in the business, not redistributing earnings back to shareholders, but CFRA Research\u2019s Angelo Zino and Baird\u2019s Ted Mortonson both said these dividend payments don\u2019t represent a threat to future dominance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t view it as a problem,\u201d Mortonson said. \u201cI view it as they\u2019ve won. They\u2019ve won the technology side. They've won on the business-model side, and they're going to win on the Gen AI cycle.\u201d\nThe \"Magnificent Seven,\" a movie-inspired moniker that refers to\u00a0Alphabet,\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Apple, Meta,\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Nvidia, and\u00a0Tesla, accounted for half of the S&P 500\u2019s total gains last year,\u00a0according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Amazon and Tesla\u2014the latter an outlier in the group due to its much weaker profitability\u2014are the only two members that do not pay a dividend. \nIn May, Nvidia increased its dividend by 150%, from $0.04 to $0.10, but only to make way for a 10-for-1 stock split that resulted in a quarterly payout of just $0.01. It's worth remembering the dividend yields for Big Tech remain quite low relative to the rest of the market. The average yield for a dividend-paying stock in the S&P 500 is about 2.3%, according to Barron\u2019s. That\u2019s well above the likes of Microsoft (0.73%), Apple (0.55%), Alphabet (0.47%) and Meta (0.42%), per Morningstar. \nZino noted these companies' payouts represent a marginal portion of their free cash flows, which together exceed $200 billion as of last quarter. With a collective cash balance of over $400 billion, including a whopping $162 billion at Apple, there's only so many ways for the tech giants to deploy it. \nOne option is massive share buybacks. Meta's and Alphabet\u2019s dividend announcements came with $50 billion and $70 billion repurchase authorizations, respectively. Apple set the record for the largest buyback in U.S. history by repurchasing $110 billion of shares in May, topping the $100 billion mark it previously set in 2018.\nPotential acquisitions, however, appear to be drying up as Big Tech draws antitrust scrutiny. Widely expected regulatory hurdles, for example, might have scuttled talks over Google\u2019s $23 billion bid for cybersecurity startup Wiz last week.\nSo, despite hefty investments in AI, there\u2019s plenty to reinvest and then some.\n\u201cThey better pay a dividend,\u201d Mortonson said of the tech giants, \u201cbecause they\u2019re going to be free cash flowing better than some countries.\u201d\nBoth Mortonson and Zino noted paying dividends makes these Big Tech stocks eligible for inclusion in income and dividend funds, expanding their investor pools dramatically. The recent sell-off of tech stocks, meanwhile, could also make these companies more appealing to value-focused investors.\n\u201cWe see potential for them to significantly hike those dividends here over the next three years or so,\u201d Zino said.\nFor investors seeking both eye-watering growth and consistent returns, it just might be a win-win.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "How Apple and Samsung are selling gen AI is wildly different",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "The world\u2019s two biggest smartphone makers, Samsung and Apple (AAPL), are going all in on generative AI. Take a look at Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris, where the company debuted its latest foldable smartphones and espoused the benefits of its Galaxy AI platform.\nApple, meanwhile, spent the majority of its WWDC event in June focusing on how its Apple Intelligence generative AI software will power new features on its iPhones. But the companies that, according to IDC, made up a combined 36.6% of the global smartphone market as of the second quarter of 2024 are taking decidedly different approaches to bringing generative AI to their users.\nSamsung is angling to quickly build a large user base for its generative AI services, thus incentivizing developers to build apps for its Galaxy AI platform. And as those apps prove to be more capable and useful, Samsung will draw in more users.\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy AI features are available on this year\u2019s Galaxy S24, last year\u2019s S23, and 2022\u2019s Galaxy S22, not to mention three generations of its foldable phones. Overall, Samsung says it expects to put Galaxy AI on some 200 million devices by the end of the year. Apple, however, says only people who own its most powerful iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and later iterations of the ubiquitous smartphone will get Apple Intelligence features.\nApple is banking on boosting iPhone sales in the near to medium term by getting users who are interested in generative AI apps to upgrade to the next generation of devices, rather than holding on to their current iPhones for years to come.\nDespite the difference in approaches, both companies still need to prove to consumers that generative AI apps are worth the hype. And that will take time.\n\u201cThrough 2025, if not a little bit longer, most of the purchasing would be purchasing that would have happened anyway as opposed to [people] running out because they need [AI] features,\u201d explained Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC's Mobile Device Tracker suite.\nSamsung got the jump on Apple in the AI race, debuting its Galaxy AI platform, complete with a handful of Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) AI apps, alongside its Galaxy S24 line in January. Since then, the company says 77% of S24 users have used its AI capabilities at least once per week. So far, Samsung says Google\u2019s Circle to Search feature, which lets you snap photos of objects and text and circle them to identify or translate them, is among users\u2019 favorite AI options.\nIn addition to Google\u2019s Circle to Search, Samsung offers AI-powered translation, transcription, text composition, and photo editing apps. Of those, I find transcription to be the most useful. Photo editing, which lets you manipulate photos using generative AI, feels like more of a party trick than a must-have feature that people will use on a regular basis.\nStill, those options are a start. And getting them into the hands of users and developers will inevitably help Samsung create more interesting and, importantly, useful AI offerings moving forward.\n\u201cI think Samsung is recognizing that they want to get [Galaxy AI] out there to as many people as they can,\u201d explained TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell.\n\u201cThey want to get developers excited to create things for their platforms. And so, this is a way to do that, because all of a sudden, you've got a significantly larger install base with Samsung incorporating a few previous generations, whereas, obviously with Apple, it's going be a significantly smaller install base,\u201d he added.\nSamsung\u2019s approach should incentivize developers eager to reach a large user base to begin building apps for its platform. And if those developers build engaging apps, users will inevitably opt for Samsung\u2019s devices to gain access to those apps. The approach isn\u2019t going to move smartphone units in the immediate future, but if customers like using apps built for Samsung\u2019s AI services, they\u2019ll be far more likely to purchase the company\u2019s devices when they\u2019re shopping for a new phone in the future.\nApple, however, isn\u2019t interested in waiting for phone sales to trickle in over time. The company clearly wants users to go buy its next-generation iPhone the moment it hits the market, likely this September. It makes sense for Apple. The iPhone is its most important product, and after sales declines in 2023 and a mixed start to 2024, getting new devices into consumers' hands sooner rather than later is a must.\nWall Street is hoping the company\u2019s Apple Intelligence platform helps power a new sales cycle in the year ahead. Tying the software to the latest and greatest iPhones gives Apple a better chance of pulling that off.\nBut it also means it\u2019ll have a smaller install base of users for its generative AI products than Samsung. And that could hurt AI developers building on Apple\u2019s software, at least in the near term.\nAll of this generative AI talk, though, won\u2019t be worth a thing if consumers don\u2019t actually understand it. While Samsung\u2019s early usage numbers are impressive, they only account for users who access its AI software once per week. Considering we pick up our phones dozens of times each day, that\u2019s not exactly a ringing endorsement just yet.\nAnecdotally, my family and friends are still largely confused by what adding generative AI to their smartphones means for them. While Samsung and Apple have made splashy announcements, the average consumer, at least in so far as my own circle goes, doesn\u2019t quite get the whole concept quite yet.\nFor now, we\u2019ll have to see how Apple pitches its Apple Intelligence during its expected iPhone event in September and how Samsung and Google continue to evolve their own messaging and offerings in the months ahead.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's holding company, owns a portfolio of around 45 stocks. But those are far from equally weighted. Several stocks, like drink maker Diageo and financial company Jefferies, barely register above 0% of the entire portfolio. But Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) accounts for an outsize portion of the total.\nApple weighs in at 44.7% of the entire Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio, equivalent to $185 billion. It owns nearly 790 million shares of Apple stock, or a 5.1% stake in the company.\nBuffett recently grouped Apple together with American Express and Coca-Cola as stocks he plans to hold forever. \"Unless something really extraordinary happens,\" he said at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting, \"we will own Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" referring to Greg Abel, who is next in line to lead the company.\nApple has all of the qualities Buffett frequently extols in his shareholder letters.\nIt has strong management, with a seamless transition from founder and former CEO Steve Jobs to current CEO Tim Cook. It sells excellent products and has a competitive advantage, and customers are willing to pay premium prices for access to these products. It also has varied revenue streams in its broad array of products and services, and it plays a large role in the global economy, with continuing opportunities to do so. It also pays a dividend.\nWhen Buffett first bought Apple stock in 2016, it was trading at a low P/E ratio. That's increased over the past few years, but Buffett hasn't sold it, indicating that he still thinks it's a good value at the current price.\nApple stock has been feeling some pressure this year, and it's been knocked down from the most valuable company on the market to second place.

        "Title": "Why Berkshire Hathaway Is Likely to Continue to Sell Its Apple Stake",
        "Author": "  Grahamites ",
        "Text": "In a previous discussion, I wrote about potential reasons why Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is missing from the permanent holding list for Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B). Shortly after publication, the insurance conglomerate reported that it cut its stake in the tech giant by about 13% during the first quarter.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CCL.\nThis 13% cut is the second quarter in a row that Buffett has trimmed Berkshire's massive Apple position. The company also sold about 1% of its Apple position during the fourth quarter of 2023. Berkshire's first-quarter sale marked its largest cut in Berkshire's Apple stake since the initial purchase in 2016. I believe Buffett is very likely to continue to sell down the Apple stake over the next several quarters and years for a few reasons.\nWhen asked about the Apple sale during the annual meeting, Buffett said the following:\n\"Almost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it's been 52% in the past when I've been operatingIt doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope that with all that America has done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it and if I'm doing it at 21%, and we're doing it at a lot higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind that we sold a little Apple this year.\nEssentially Buffett said that he is selling Apple now because the capital gains tax rate is at a very low level and he thinks the capital gain tax rate may rise in the future due to the growing budget deficit. Here the guru is again subtlety insinuating that the company is not a permanent holding for Berkshire Hathaway because if it doesn't consider selling Apple at all, then the tax rate does not matter.\nApple's current valuation, driven by years of strong performance, has reached a peak level. The following chart shows Apple's price-to-owner earnings, price-sales and price-book ratios all reached peak levels.\nNot only is Apple's valuation at peak level, its margin expansion, which is driven by both improving operational efficiency and higher contribution from higher-margin service revenue, may also have reached its peak, leaving little room for future margin expansion.\nApple's potential peak margin, combined with the possible slowdown in the growth rate of the smartphone business and the heightened competition from Huawei, suggest revenue and earnings may struggle to sustain the impressive growth rate achieved in recent years. In fact, we have already noticed a slowdown in recent quarters. It has yet to be seen whether the hype surrounding Apple Intelligence, the company's version of artificial intelligence, will materially boost the sales of the next generation of iPhones.\nCEO Tim Cook started Apple's share buyback program in 2013. Since then, the company has repurchased $651 billion worth of its common stock, reducing its share count by 11 billion shares, or roughly 41% of its outstanding shares. From 2013 to 2019, Apple's stock was very cheap, making the stock repurchases extremely value-additive.\nThe stock got cheap again for a short period of time during 2020 and 2022. However, as I pointed out above, at the present market price, Apple's valuation has reached peak level. At this level, stock buybacks are very unlikely to be the best way to allocate capital. Nonetheless, share repurchases remain Apple's largest capital allocation option. Therefore, its return from capital allocation is almost guaranteed to decline from what it has been over the past decade.\nBuffett has repeatedly cited Cook's leadership as a major reason for his investment decision. Cook has proven that he possesses the rare skillset of both operational excellence and outstanding capital allocation capability.\nCook is turning 64 in November. By Berkshire's standard, he is far from retirement age. However, the CEO himself has publicly said he will not stick around for many years. Concerns over Cook's retirement first emerged in 2021 when he said he \"will probably be leaving Apple in the next 10 years, A recent report from Bloomberg wrote that people close to him believe Cook will be Apple's CEO for at least another three years.\nAs I wrote in my previous discussion, Apple is not an idiot-proof business. Cook's potential retirement may not be imminent, but Buffett must be thinking about it.\nGiven the uncertainties surrounding capital gains tax rates, concerns about Apple's peak valuation and peak margin, diminishing returns from capital allocation and the potential retirement of Cook, it is extremely likely that Berkshire Hathaway will continue to trim its massive position in Apple. We will find out over the next few quarters.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "The Fly ",
        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop 5 Upgrades: \nLoop Capital upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $300, up from $170. Loop's supply chain work suggests that Apple has an opportunity the next few years to solidify itself as consumer's generative artificial intelligence \"base camp\" of choice, just as it did for social media 15 years ago with the iPhone and digital content consumption 20 years ago with the iPod.\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Alcon (ALC) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $85, up from $65. The firm's prior downgrade of the stock was predicated on a sluggish U.S. premium IOL market, and while that risk remains, \"there can be no doubt\" that Alcon has found other factors that have more than offset the risk, diminishing the bear case, the firm tells investors.\nBMO Capital upgraded UDR (UDR) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $45, up from $39. BMO's recent discussion with private owner Carmel Partners reinforced its view that coastal fundamentals have continued to be strong, in particular Washington, D.C., UDR's largest market.\nRBC Capital upgraded TD Synnex (SNX) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $140, up from $135. The firm says solid growth in advanced solutions driven by data center builds and cloud deployments, Hyve customer ramp, PC refresh cycle, and demand for AI-powered PCs should improve TD Synnex's billings growth to mid-single-digits in the second half of 2024 with likely further improvement in fiscal 2025.\nBaird upgraded Carrier Global (CARR) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $75, up from $64. The firm sees multiple catalysts that could play out over the next 12-18 months for the company, including asset sales, buybacks and reaccelerating residential trends.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nCiti downgraded Electronic Arts (EA) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $161, up from $148. Since the fiscal Q2 results, EA's shares have risen 15% on optimism around the upcoming release of College Football, and while bullish on the release, Citi has some concerns, including potential weakness at Apex Legends, potential crowding out from GTA IV's release in Q4 of 2025, and macro risk if consumer spending moderates.\nTD Cowen downgraded Travelers (TRV) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $230, down from $252, citing uncertainty about whether modest adverse development for liability coverages in Q1 in recent accident years is a sign of more to come.\nCiti downgraded On Semiconductor (ON) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $77, down from $85. The firm believes the company's silicon carbide exposure will hurt its multiple.\nWells Fargo downgraded SBA Communications (SBAC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $220, down from $230. Despite some interest rate cute enthusiasm, the company's fundamentals will remain \"relatively weak\" near-term with no funds from operations inflection until 2027 and a lack of a discernible catalyst on the horizon, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nSusquehanna downgraded Caesars Entertainment (CZR) to Negative from Neutral with a price target of $33, down from $44. The firm believes the stock's underperformance versus MGM Resorts (MGM) is very likely to continue.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nEvercore ISI initiated coverage of Datadog (DDOG) with an Outperform rating and $150 price target. After \"treading water\" for two years, Datadog has matured to a point and grown into its valuation so that it can become a more consistent compounder over the next 12-24 months, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBaird initiated coverage of SentinelOne (S) with an Outperform rating and $25 price target. Despite a slight fiscal 2025 guidance down-revision, SentinelOne maintains a strong growth trajectory, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBaird initiated coverage of Rubrik (RBRK) with an Outperform rating and $42 price target. target. Rubrik stands out as a \"top-tier data security vendor, seamlessly integrating backup and security amid surging data and cyber threats,\" the firm argues.\nBaird initiated coverage of Tenable Holdings (TENB) with an Outperform rating and $55 price target. The firm sees upside potential amid \"modest\" growth expectations, favorable market dynamics, and the company's strategic expansion into federal markets, diversifying its revenue streams.\nTruist initiated coverage of Zeta Global (ZETA) with a Buy rating and $23 price target. Zeta is \"a potential disruptive force\" in the large and growing marketing tech space, serving enterprises with unique combination of data, AI-powered intelligence, marketing cloud and activation capabilities, the firm tells investors. \n"

        "Text": "All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Aug 1. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.\u00a0Apple reclaimed the most valuable title last month and emerged as one of the strongest performers relative to the other \u201cMag 7\u201d amid the recent sell-off. The stock has gained about 28.5% over the past three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 8.4%. The solid trend is expected to continue, given that the tech giant has a strong chance of beating earnings estimates. It has seen positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis has put investors\u2019 focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW, iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF IWY and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation. These ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.30% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\u00a0Apple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the fiscal third quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year growth of 6.3% for earnings and 3.2% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.14% in the trailing four quarters (read: Tech ETFs Faceoff: Apple Vs. Microsoft).\u00a0The stock currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.68 a month ago based on 30 recommendations. Of the 30 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 66.67% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 63.33%, while Buy represented 10%.Based on the short-term price targets of 32 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $232.22. The forecasts range from a low of $180.00 to a high of $300.00.\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally turning around following the launch of a brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence for iPhones, iPads and Macs in June. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple (read: Apple Jumps on the AI Bandwagon: ETFs to Buy).The technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. Apple also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which provides customers access to ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost. The company released a beta version of its new iOS 18.1 to developers early this week, offering the first look of Apple Intelligence and some of the iPhone maker's new artificial intelligence features.According to LSEG data, the tech titan is expected to win back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts and by selling more high-margin iPads with a refreshed design. iPhone sales are expected to decrease 2.2% in the to-be-reported quarter, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter. This suggests that the worst might be over for Apple.For the fiscal third quarter, the iPhone maker expects overall revenues \"to grow low-single digits\" and iPad revenues to grow in double digits.\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) - Apple accounts for a 16.1% share.MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC) - Apple accounts for a 16% share in the basket.\u00a0iShares US Technology ETF (IYW) - Apple makes up 16.1% of the assets.iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF (IWY) - Apple accounts for a 13.8% share in the basket.Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) - Apple accounts for 12.4% of the total assets\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  James Brumley, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Consumer technology titan Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been paying dividends to shareholders since 2012. The dividend, however, isn't the reason investors own the stock. This ticker's been incredibly rewarding since the company first unveiled its iPhone back in 2007, up nearly 4,500% during that time, making Apple the world's biggest publicly traded organization (as measured by market cap).\nNevertheless, it is a dividend stock. The big question? How much will Apple pay in dividends this year?\nAs of May, Apple's quarterly dividend stands at $0.25 per share. That's up a penny from February's per-share payout of $0.24, continuing the company's cadence of yearly dividend growth. Assuming the payout stays at its current level for the rest of the year, shareholders can anticipate getting $0.99 in per-share dividends payable in 2024, which will cost the company something on the order of $15 billion.\nIt can afford them to be sure. Despite the headwind currently working against its flagship iPhone business, Apple's still managed to generate $57.6 billion in net income during the six-month stretch ending in March following a bottom line of nearly $97 billion for the fiscal year ending in September.\nThat's an encouraging degree of dividend-supporting profitability. It leaves lots of room for continued payout growth or wiggle room should earnings stumble.\nFor investors prioritizing income though, Apple's not your best option. Newcomers would be stepping in while the dividend yield's less than 0.5% of the stock's present price. That's not a lot, particularly given the number of higher-yielding options available right now.\nIndeed, Apple remains far better-suited for growth-minded investors if for no other reason than it's investing so much more in reducing its sheer number of outstanding shares. The company spent over $43 billion on stock repurchases alone during the six months ending in March, following the prior fiscal year's $76.6 billion worth of spending on buybacks.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "India announced it will cut import duty on mobile phones and some key parts to 15% from 20%, a move that will directly benefit Apple (AAPL), which still imports its high-end smartphones into the country despite increasing local production.\nPresenting the annual budget for 2024/25 in parliament on Tuesday, India's finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said import tax on mobile phones, printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and mobile chargers is in the \"interest of consumers.\"\nAlmost 10-12% of the Apple iPhones are imported each year into India and a 5% reduction in tax on the devices will result in a $35-50 million annual benefit to Apple, said Neil Shah, a co-founder at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research.\nAlthough Apple has boosted its local production in India through contract manufacturers such as Foxconn (601138.SS)and India's Tata Group, it still imports some of its high-end Pro and Pro Max iPhone models into the country.\nApple \"will directly benefit ... they (also) have some models for which PCBAs are still being imported,\" said Shah.\nThe move will also \"alleviate import duties for new players entering the market. It's a gamechanger for them,\" he added.\nOther manufacturers such as Samsung (005930.KS) would also benefit, but to a lesser degree as the majority of their smartphones are locally made, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\nApple and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nApple has a 6% share of India's smartphone market, according to Counterpoint.\nIndia's deputy IT ministry in January privately argued for a reduction on import taxes on mobile phones, saying the country risks losing out to China and Vietnam in the race to become a major smartphone export hub and must \"act fast\" to lure global companies with lower tariffs, Reuters has reported.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and the nation's $24-billion local production scheme covers mobile phones, prompting companies such as Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Vivo to expand local operations.\nChina's Xiaomi has also in the past asked for tariff reductions on sub-components used in batteries, USB cables and phone covers.\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil, Editing by Louise Heavens)\n"

        "Title": "At last, Apple's Messages app will support RCS and scheduling texts",
        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "The biggest updates coming to Apple's iMessage and its Messages app in iOS 18 aren't its AI emoji, Genmoji, or even the ability to send texts via satellite. It's the ability to finally, finally schedule messages to send at a later date and time, as well as support for RCS, the next-gen messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will make texting with Android folks much less painful. These updates are now available in iOS 18's public beta, which just opened up this week.\nThough buried amid a slate of AI announcements and other user interface tweaks at WWDC 2024, these messaging features will have a significant impact on how people communicate every day.\nFor years, consumer demand for scheduling messages has led developers to create complicated and cumbersome workarounds, like apps that remind you via push notifications to send a text, for example, or solutions that only worked on jailbroken iPhones. The new iOS will offer the ability to schedule your messages to be sent later as built-in functionality.\nThe feature only got a brief mention at WWDC. In Apple's press release, it was announced in the same sentence as the Tapbacks upgrade, which has expanded to include support for any emoji or sticker in iOS 18. Clearly, Apple doesn't think \"Send Later\" is a feature worth spending much time on. But for anyone who runs a business from their iPhone -- or people who only remember the important things they need to text while laying in bed at 3 a.m. -- the new scheduling feature will be a much-welcomed addition. Beyond simply making life easier, like when you want to text someone across time zones without disturbing them, Apple's screenshot suggests you could also use the feature to ensure you don't miss sending someone a birthday greeting.\nOf even greater importance, however, is the Messages app's support for RCS, the messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will address many of the grievances of texting those Android users with a green bubble.\nFor a long time, Google has urged and campaigned for Apple to adopt the standard, which would improve the communication experience between Android and iOS users. The Wall Street Journal ran a report on the fight over the green bubbles and how blue bubbles are a must-have for U.S. teens. While EU regulators ultimately decided that iMessage was not popular enough to be forced to open up and become interoperable with other messaging services, the additional scrutiny likely influenced Apple's decision here -- as did U.S. lawmakers' interest in Apple's shutdown of Beeper, a third-party app that brought iMessage to Android users.\nBecause of Apple's longtime refusal to add support for RCS, texting with Android users meant no typing indicators or read receipts, broken group chats and blurry photos and videos. It also meant that messages would not be end-to-end encrypted as they were on iMessage.\nUnfortunately for Android users, Messages sent via RCS won't be relieved of the green bubble curse on Apple devices according to screenshots on its website, which show the feature in action. Instead, the text box indicates in a light gray font that your texts with someone support both \"Text message + RCS,\" while the texts themselves are still green.\nHowever, issues that make the Messages app a broken experience for Apple's customers will be addressed, it seems, as Apple says it will support the standard later this year. The news, of course, only got a brief mention in Apple's press release, where it noted that RCS would allow for \"richer media and more reliable group messaging compared to SMS and MMS.\"\nEarlier reports indicated Apple intends to work with the GSMA to add support for end-to-end encryption in the Universal Profile for RCS, but won't support E2EE out of the gate. That's likely why there was no mention of encrypted messaging in Apple's announcement of RCS.\nThis story was originally published June 11 and was updated to reflect that the iOS 18 public beta is live.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/at-last-apples-messages-app-will-support-rcs-and-scheduling-texts/\n"

A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in \u201cdenial\u201d about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 31X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock is overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth expectation of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) skeptics have long believed that the company is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) almost always makes its own way and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet.

In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape.

The agreement includes rules about scheduling, severance, and sub-contracting, and requires that any discipline not be \u201carbitrary, capricious or without merit,\u201d an IAM spokesperson said. The three-year deal will increase pay by an average of 10% and maintains the status quo on healthcare, retirement, and staffing, according to the union.\nThe Maryland store is one of two unionized sites among Apple\u2019s roughly 270 US locations. Both were organized in 2022, and since then contract talks have also been underway at an Oklahoma City store that unionized with the Communications Workers of America.\nBoth IAM and CWA have been attempting to expand their footholds to other Apple locations around the country, but efforts have so far come up short. Employees\u2019 assessments of what their peers in Maryland won in their contract talks could either ignite or subdue interest in organizing other stores.\nIn an emailed statement, the IAM\u2019s negotiating committee said it planned to \u201cbuild on this success in store after store and grow the power\u201d it created at the Towson, Maryland site. \u201cWe are giving our members a voice in their futures and a strong first step toward further gains.\u201d\nIn May, employees at the Towson store voted to authorize a potential strike, accusing the company of refusing to fairly negotiate.\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.

There are no reports that the company plans to unveil an ad-supported tier in the U.S., however.\nApple did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment on the report.\nApple TV+ already has some commercials on its service, but only for live sporting events like Major League Soccer. Unlike Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and virtually every other streaming service, though, it does not offer a lower-cost ad-supported monthly option for subscribers. (Those additional offerings have proven quite popular with users, resulting in higher subscriber counts.)\nApple has taken some steps in recent months that indicate it is considering an ad-supported subscription model, however. Earlier this year, the company hired Joseph Cady, who previously servied as EVP of advanced advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. That came after a number of prominent hires of people with experience in television advertising.\nAd-supported tiers not only have boosted subscriber counts for other streaming services, they\u2019re a good source of additional revenue for the companies.\nThe news of a possible ad-supported tier comes as Apple TV+ is also reportedly talking with Paramount+ about a possible bundle of their streaming services. As subscriber churn has continued to be a problem for many streamers (and viewers have grown weary of the cost of these services), a growing number are teaming up to offer lower-priced options to consumers.

        "Text": "Institutions' substantial holdings in Apple implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\n Insiders have sold recently \nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 56% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Apple.\n View our latest analysis for Apple \nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nApple already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Apple's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Apple. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.8% of common stock, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds about 5.1% of the company stock.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur information suggests that Apple Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. \nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 38% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nPublic companies currently own 5.1% of Apple stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

        "Text": "Wednesday, July 3, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), as well as a micro-cap stock Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC).\u00a0 The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Apple\u2019s shares have only slightly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+14.5% vs. +14.3%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple\u2019s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.However, Apple\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.Apple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have far outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +32.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia/Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platform is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects.AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Tesla\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (-17.3% vs. -16.9%). The company\u2019s recently shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. Tesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.With competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game-changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its \"robotaxi\" venture.The successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win. Additionally, TSLA\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)Shares of Natural Health Trends have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+25.6% vs. -10.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $79.12 million shows a promising uptick, with an 11% quarterly order rise and a 1% annual increase, suggesting a market and operational recovery.Despite a slight revenue drop, cash flow remains positive, supported by prudent financial strategies, including a $0.20 dividend. The company is capitalizing on emerging markets like India, showing substantial growth, and aligning with global e-commerce trends to boost online sales. Strategic initiatives, new products and member incentives such as MetaBoost are aimed at growth and market share.However, challenges include a significant membership decline, impacting sales potential, and heavy reliance on volatile markets like Hong Kong and China.

        "Text": "Tech majors Microsoft and Apple are dropping out of their respective seats on the Board of Directors of AI startup OpenAI, the developer of generative chatbot ChatGPT, amid increasing regulatory scrutiny in Europe and the US over generative AI, according to reports.\nMicrosoft, OpenAI's largest investor, has quit as an observer on OpenAI's nonprofit board, a non-voting seat which it took in November last year.\nMicrosoft's Deputy General Counsel Keith Dolliver, in a letter to OpenAI, said the seat was no longer needed as the company had witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board.\nFurther, Apple, which was planning to join the Board following its recent AI development deal, is said to be no longer taking its board seat.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple announced its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iOS 18.\nAs part of the collaboration, Phil Schiller, the former marketing head and chief of the App Store at Apple, was selected to have an observer role on OpenAI's board, and was expected to join later this year.\nConfirming that Microsoft has given up its seat, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe reportedly said, \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\"Under the leadership of CFO Sarah Friar, we are establishing a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners - such as Microsoft and Apple - and investors - such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\"\nThe new approach by OpenAI is said to involve regular stakeholder meetings with Microsoft and Apple to share progress on its mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\nMicrosoft took the non-voting board seat at OpenAI during the troubling period of the startup last year, when its co-founder Sam Altman was ousted from the Board and as CEO after alleging that he was not consistently candid in his communications.\nAltman rejoined as CEO few days later, and also to the board after an independent Special Committee investigation found that his conduct did not mandate removal.\nThe news comes as the European Commission recently said Microsoft could face an antitrust investigation as the regulator was looking into some of the deals between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers to find the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics.\nThe Commission in January said it was checking whether Microsoft's investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger Regulation.\n"

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWedbush Securities in a fresh note said mega-cap tech stocks have a 15% upside in the second half of 2024, driven by AI. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been beating the AI drum and thinks the AI \u201cparty\u201d is just getting started, wrote that the $4 trillion AI arms race is between major tech players and GPU chips have become the new oil or gold in the tech industry.\nIves wrote that he thinks NASDAQ will have another strong second half of the year.\n\u201cTech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand.\u201d\nWhile Ives continues to see the major tech stocks leading the AI market, he thinks the AI-led rally can broaden out to tech companies who have strong \u201cinstalled\u201d bases which can actually use generative AI applications and models.\nLast month, while talking to CNBC, Ives said that the tech bull market is going to last for at least two more years. When asked what could be the threat to this bull run, Ives said that China could be a threat amid a possibility of \u201ctech cold war\u201d but he thinks that is a \u201ccontained threat.\u201d\n\u201cIt started off with the semis, but now it\u2019s started to happen is, the demand and the use cases\u201d are expanding to other companies. Ives called the AI boom the \u201cfourth industrial revolution.\u201d\nWe picked top AI stocks from Wedbush\u2019s latest note. The firm named some of these stocks as the best picks for the second half of 2024 while called others \u201coversold\u201d tech stocks. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple is among the top picks of Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives for the second half of 2024.\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in \u201cdenial\u201d about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nApple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock\u2019s overvalued, given Apple\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. dropped plans to take board roles at OpenAI in a surprise decision that underscores growing regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech\u2019s influence over artificial intelligence.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign\nTrump Taps Vance as Running Mate, Picking Populist Protege\nTrump Classified Documents Case Dismissed by Florida Judge\nBold and Bloodied Trump Seizes the Moment After Being Shot\nMicrosoft, which invested $13 billion in the ChatGPT creator, will withdraw from its observer role on the board, the company said in a letter to OpenAI on Tuesday, which was seen by Bloomberg News. Apple was due to take up a similar role, but an OpenAI spokesperson said the startup won\u2019t have board observers after Microsoft\u2019s departure.\nRegulators in the US and Europe had expressed concerns about Microsoft\u2019s sway over OpenAI, applying pressure on one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies to show that it\u2019s keeping the relationship at arm\u2019s length. Microsoft has integrated OpenAI\u2019s services into its Windows and Copilot AI platforms and, like other big US tech companies, is banking on the new technology to help drive growth.\nStill, the board resignation is unlikely to resolve the US Federal Trade Commission\u2019s concerns about Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI, a source familiar with the agency\u2019s thinking said. Other regulators will likely feel similarly because the change doesn\u2019t alter Microsoft\u2019s close ties to the startup, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said in a note on Wednesday.\n\u201cMicrosoft \u2018giving up\u2019 its OpenAI board seat is just another gambit on the chessboard,\u201d said Foxglove director Cori Crider, whose law firm is pushing for more antitrust scrutiny of the relationship. \u201cBig Tech know they\u2019re in a cat-and-mouse game with antitrust enforcers over AI.\u201d\nThe Financial Times reported Microsoft\u2019s exit earlier.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\nThe move by Microsoft and Apple to opt out as observers from the OpenAI board may be driven by regulatory pressure, but we don\u2019t see this lessening their influence over the latter\u2019s product strategy or ending the antitrust investigations. In the longer term, we see other cloud providers such as AWS or even Google to be preferred vendors for OpenAI as demand increases and it faces more scrutiny globally.\n\u2014 Justin Teresi, BI Litigation Analyst and Anurag Rana BI Technology Analyst\nAI Scrutiny\nMicrosoft is facing broader scrutiny over its alleged dominance of artificial intelligence. In January, the US Federal Trade Commission said it was looking into Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI as part of a broader inquiry into Big Tech companies and their partnerships with AI startups. Separately, the US is looking at whether the company properly notified antitrust agencies about its deal with an OpenAI rival, Inflection AI, people familiar with the matter have said.\nEuropean regulators also said they were going to survey Microsoft\u2019s rivals about OpenAI\u2019s exclusive use of its technology, and the UK\u2019s competition regulator is weighing a deeper investigation of the tie up.\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t being singled out. The UK is also looking into Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s $4 billion collaboration with AI company Anthropic, expressing concern that large tech companies are using partnerships to \u201cshield themselves from competition.\u201d The US is probing Nvidia Corp.\u2019s dominance over AI chips.\nMicrosoft shares rose 0.4% to $461.38 at 11:31 a.m. in New York trading. Apple gained 1.1% to $231.19.\nBig Tech Investments\nThe biggest US tech companies including Microsoft as well as Nvidia, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com have poured tens of billions of dollars into AI businesses. While these investments and partnerships are a lifeline for the startups, regulators have expressed concern that they threaten to concentrate access to the most innovative large language models among the tech companies that already dominate other platforms.\nTech giants are also striking non-financial agreements. These include Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the iPhone, and Microsoft\u2019s decision earlier this year to bring on Inflection AI\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman and most of his staff from the OpenAI rival.\nMicrosoft took on the non-voting observer role on OpenAI\u2019s board last year, weeks after the startup\u2019s directors had fired Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman in a dramatic coup over the direction of the company. Altman was quickly reinstated following a backlash from employees and the board was remade.\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\u201d OpenAI said in a statement to Bloomberg News, without commenting directly on Apple or Microsoft\u2019s decisions.\nOpenAI said that moving forward, the company will host regular stakeholder meetings with partners and investors, including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, \u201cto share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\u201d\nOpenAI began in 2015 as a nonprofit research organization, but later shifted its structure to include a for-profit startup that has solicited investments and struck commercial partnerships.\n--With assistance from Rachel Metz, Katharine Gemmell, Samuel Stolton and Mark Bergen.\n(Updates with people familiar on FTC, analyst commentary from fourth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\nUkraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs\nAsia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel\nFrench Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Timothy Smith ",
        "Text": "Shares Suffered Largest One-Day Percentage Decline Since March on Thursday\n\nApple shares shed 2.3% on Thursday as investors pivoted out of top-performing large-cap tech stocks into small caps that may benefit more from expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year.\nDespite Thursday's drop, Apple shares remain in an uptrend, with the price continuing to gain momentum this month after breaking out from a pennant pattern.\nThe measuring principle, which calculates the distance of the trend in points that proceeded the pennant and adds that amount to the pattern\u2019s top trendline, forecasts a price target of $271.\nDuring pullbacks, Apple shares may encounter support on the chart at levels including $220, $197, and $190.\n\nApple (AAPL) shares shed 2.3% on Thursday to record their largest one-day percentage fall since late March as investors pivoted out of top-performing large-cap tech stocks into small caps that may benefit more from rate cuts. The rotation came after a government inflation report revealed that consumer prices unexpectedly fell in June, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting its benchmark interest rate soon.\nBelow, we take a closer look at the technicals on Apple\u2019s chart, while also pointing out important levels to watch out for that may come into play over the coming weeks.\nDespite Thursday's decline, which snapped a seven-session winning streak for the stock, Apple shares remain in a longer-term uptrend.\nAfter breaking above key resistance to a new record high in mid-June, the stock's price consolidated within a pennant pattern for several weeks before gaining further upward momentum this month.\nMoreover, a recent cross of the 50-day moving average (MA) above the 200-day MA to form a bullish golden cross signals rising prices.\nSamsul Said / Bloomberg / Getty Images\nTo project a potential upside target in Apple shares, we can use the measuring principle. We do this by calculating the distance of the trend in points that proceeded the pennant and apply that amount to the pattern\u2019s top trendline.\nFor example, we add $56 to $215, which forecasts a price target of $271. This technique provides investors with a general area on the chart where the shares may trend to if the price rhymes with the prior move higher between late April and mid-June.\nDespite the bullish technicals, it's worth monitoring several locations on the chart where the price would likely encounter support if the current pullback continues.\nThe first area sits at $220, a level that may attract buyers near the pennant pattern\u2019s high.\nA failure to hold this initial area could see Apple shares fall to around $197, where they would likely find support near a horizontal line that connects several prior record highs and the upward sloping 50-day MA.\nFinally, a deeper retracement could spark a fall to around $190, a chart location that finds support from a trendline linking a range of peaks and troughs from September 2023 to May this year.\nApple shares were up 0.4% at $228.41 in recent premarket trading Friday.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Cramer said Biden once told him that he was the \u201cpoorest senator out of one hundred because he owned no stocks.\u201d\n\u201cHe was actually bragging about it,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer said that Joe Biden is not the \u201cchampion\u201d of stocks and he\u2019s \u201con board with labor.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what Cramer said about Trump:\n\u201cIn the many years I\u2019ve known Trump and I have known him fairly well, he\u2019s been wildely pro stock market, always watching it like a hawk. He loves bantering about the stock market.\u201d\nCramer said that even though Trump was in \u201creal estate, he enjoyed stocks.\u201d\nJim Cramer added that Trump always thought there was too much regulation and was also \u201cwildly\u201d pro-oil and gas.\u00a0 The CNBC host said since Trump cannot see the stock market going down and sees the market gains as a positive factor even for his presidency, his arrival in the White House could boost stock portfolios.\n\u201cHate him or like him, he\u2019s good for your portfolio.\u201d\nFor this article watched the latest programs of Cramer where he mentioned stocks that could benefit from a Trump presidency. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that could see troubles if Donald Trump comes to power because of the China factor, according to Cramer. He said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has high exposure to China as the company makes \u201cChinese phones with Chinese labor\u201d\nHowever, there\u2019s a positive factor for Apple, too, if Trump comes to the White House, according to Cramer. He thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u00a0has been \u201cabused\u201d by the government on several regulatory issues.\n\u201cNeither of the candidates seems like Big Tech but Trump administration will certainly be more circumspect about hammering great American tech companies.\u201d\nDoes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have any AI growth catalysts? Wall Street is turning bullish on the company after Apple revealed Apple Intelligence plans at the WWDC event.\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it\u2019s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance after unveiling its AI strategy to its software developers. The Company has been at the forefront of proprietary computer processor development for over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well-situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. While revenue growth has been relatively flat post-Covid-19, we expect Apple\u2019s AI value proposition will be compelling enough for consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Apple Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Over the past year, many Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n View our latest analysis for Apple \nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior VP, Katherine Adams, for US$23m worth of shares, at about US$189 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$224). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 30% of Katherine Adams's stake.\nInsiders in Apple didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Apple. In total, insiders dumped US$15m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Apple insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$2.1b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Apple makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Apple you should know about.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock recently received a pair of price target hikes. An analyst at Piper Sandler raised its target to $225 per share from $190, while an analyst at Needham took a more aggressive view and raised the target to $260.\nThe Needham analyst likes Apple's $110 billion stock buyback plan and believes it supports the share price. Meanwhile, the Piper Sandler analyst argues Apple's stock is riding a wave of optimism over the possibility of a bounce back in growth in iPhone sales in China, and the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications that could lead to an upgrade cycle in iPhones.\nApple's revenue mix is changing, with its higher-margin services revenue (roughly double the gross margin of its product revenue gross margin of around 37%) representing 26.3% of revenue in the most recent quarter compared to 17.8% in 2019. Its service revenue growth is a function of growing subscriptions within its installed base of devices, which number more than 2.2 billion.\nWhile the shift to services revenue will improve margins and cash flow via the long-term stream of income from subscribers, it's still critical that Apple can generate product sales growth by driving periodic upgrade cycles with innovative products. That's where the excitement around AI comes in and why the market recently got so excited about Apple stock.\nCEO Tim Cook thinks \"AI, generative AI, and AI are big opportunities for us across our products.\" This opportunity can lead to a new cycle of product sales growth at a time when Apple is delivering on its services growth and margin expansion plans.\nThe Piper Sandler analyst has a point when referencing the recent stock run-up that reflects optimism over AI. Much of it appears to be in the price of the stock already. Apple still must contend with waning consumer spending at relatively high interest rates. Still, trading on 38 times Wall Street analyst estimates for 2024, Apple looks fully valued right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The device accounted for 50.6% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales decreased 10.5% year over year to $46 billion.\u00a0Apple is expected to have struggled in China amid significant competition from domestic handset makers. Per IDC, China\u2019s smartphone shipments grew 8.9% year over year to 71.6 million units in the second quarter of calendar 2024, driven by robust performance from Vivo, Huawei and Xiaomi. Apple is expected to have witnessed a 3.1% year-over-year decline.Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple\u2019s market share was 16% in the second quarter of calendar 2024, trailing Samsung\u2019s 18%.

An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit a worsening regulatory environment.Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, which offers Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle.\nApple\u2019s Mac sales are expected to have jumped 20.8% year over year in the second quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data.

        "Text": "BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple's smartphone shipments in China fell by 6.7% in the second quarter of 2024, as the tech giant faced intensifying competition from rivals like Huawei, according to data from market research firm Canalys.\nThe decline underscores the difficulties the U.S. tech giant faces in its third-largest market.\nApple's total shipments for the quarter ending in June stood at 9.7 million units, down from 10.4 million units in the same quarter last year, Canalys data shows.\nIn contrast, Huawei's smartphone shipments surged 41% year-on-year to 10.6 milion in the quarter, bolstered by the launch of its new Pura 70 series in April.\nThe Canalys data revealed that Apple's market share decreased to 14% from 16% in the same quarter of 2023.\nAs a result of this decline, Apple's ranking in the Chinese smartphone market fell from third to sixth place.\nOverall, China's smartphone shipments rose by 10% in the quarter, Canalys said. Vivo was the top vendor with a share of 19%, followed by Oppo, Honor and Huawei with 16%, 15% and 15% respectively.\n\"Domestic manufacturers have demonstrated market leadership, occupying the top five positions in the mainland Chinese market for the first time in history,\" said Lucas Zhong, research analyst at Canalys.\n\"On the other hand, Apple faces growth pressure in the Chinese market and is actively focusing on optimising channel management.\"\nHuawei made a comeback to the high-end smartphone segment last August with the release of a device powered by a domestically-made chip, defying U.S. sanctions that have cut off its access to the global chipset supply chain.\nIn an effort to boost sales, Apple has ramped up its discounting efforts this year to entice consumers. The U.S. company launched an aggressive campaign in May, doubling the scale of an earlier promotion in February and offering price cuts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318.84) on select iPhone models.\nAnalysts expect Huawei's strong performance to continue throughout the year. Canadian research firm TechInsights projected earlier this year that Huawei's overall smartphone shipments in China will exceed 50 million units in 2024, with the Pura 70 series accounting for 10 million of those shipments.\nThat would make Huawei the No. 1 seller with a 19% market share, up from 12% in 2023, TechInsights has said.\n($1 = 7.2136 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Casey HallEditing by David Goodman, Sharon Singleton and David Evans)\n"

Analysts forecast revenues of $84.02 billion, representing an increase of 2.7% year over year.\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 0.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Apple metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\nAnalysts expect 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' to come in at $7.51 billion.

        "Title": "Forget Apple: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Instead",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a long history of providing consistent stock gains. Its shares are up 346% in the last five years alone, outperforming many of its peers and the S&P 500's 86% rise. The company is the king of consumer tech, profiting from the immense brand loyalty it has built.\nHowever, Apple has hit many hurdles over the past year. The company got a late start in artificial intelligence (AI), which left it out of much of the rally the market has seen since the beginning of 2023.\nMeanwhile, repeated declines in sales have forced the company to rethink its product strategy. It has the cash and brand dominance to turn things around over the long term, but it might be worth investing in more reliable stocks for now.\nThis table shows Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have delivered significantly more returns than Apple since the start of 2024. They have rallied investors with dominating roles in crucial areas of AI: chip design and cloud computing. The two leaders in their respective industries are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon.\nTheir more established positions in tech indicate they could offer more share increases over the next decade than the iPhone maker. So, forget Apple and consider buying these two millionaire-maker stocks instead.\nFew stocks have been watched as closely as Nvidia has over the last year. The company has achieved rock-star status in the tech industry as its chips have become the gold standard for AI developers worldwide. Nvidia is responsible for an estimated 90% of the AI chip market thanks to the success of its graphics processing units (GPUs).\nMuch as Apple has attracted loyal users with its easy-to-use design language, Nvidia's Computer Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a leading reason for its AI dominance. CUDA is the software platform that complements the company's AI GPUs. Millions of developers have grown so accustomed to Nvidia's chip architecture that switching to similar offerings from competitors like AMD makes little sense.\nAs demand for AI services has soared, so has Nvidia's sales. The chart above shows the significant difference in financial growth that Nvidia has seen over AMD since last July. As a result, Nvidia hit $39 billion in free cash flow this year, while AMD hovered around $1 billion in free cash flow.\nNvidia's higher figure suggests it's only widening the gap between the companies, with it potentially being better equipped to keep investing in its technology and maintain its lead.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market reached $196 billion in spending last year and is growing at a rate that would see it hit close to $2 trillion by 2030. So, despite its meteoric rise since last year, the AI market still has plenty of room to run, with Nvidia well-positioned to keep seeing major gains and creating millionaires.\nAmazon has made more than a few millionaires over the years. Since its initial public offering in 1997, the company's stock has soared over 200,000%.\nIt has gone from an online book retailer to the biggest name in e-commerce in multiple countries. And as its earnings have grown, Amazon has reinvested in its business, diversifying its revenue streams to include income from cloud computing, digital advertising, streaming, and more.\nThe company posted its first-quarter earnings on April 30, delivering revenue growth of 13% year over year and beating Wall Street estimates by $750 million. Amazon proved its e-commerce business remains lucrative, with revenue rising 10% and 12% in its two retail segments. Meanwhile, retail operating income reached a collective $6 billion after reporting losses of $349 million the year before.\nBut it's outside of e-commerce where the company's greatest promise can be found. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), dominates the market, reporting revenue growth of 17% year over year and operating income that nearly doubled. The quarter also highlighted the company's budding digital ad business, with revenue in its advertising services segment rising 24% after introducing ads on Prime Video.\nWhile Apple has suffered several quarters of sales declines, Amazon has seen an impressive boost to revenue in its retail segments. Meanwhile, it has become an imposing figure in AI thanks to AWS. With growth catalysts in multiple markets, its stock is too good to ignore right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently hit a $3 trillion market cap and is now among the three most valuable companies in the world. Right above it in valuation is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), with a market cap of just under $3.4 trillion, while Microsoft is currently in the top spot at just over $3.4 trillion.\nThough Microsoft is a tech stalwart and a safe stock, I think Apple and Nvidia both possess better growth prospects in the long run. So which of them is the most likely to reach a $4 trillion valuation first?\nIt's hard to bet against Nvidia when you consider just how well its business has performed of late. The company is the leading provider of the artificial intelligence (AI) chips that other tech companies need to develop their next-gen software and models. And with AI infrastructure and development still in its early stages, Nvidia could be on the cusp of much more growth.\nThat's in stark contrast to Apple, which has been struggling lately to grow its top line at all.\nBut there is reason to expect that the gap between these growth rates will shrink. While Nvidia is a growth beast, it isn't likely to continue tripling its revenue on a year-over-year basis. As it starts lapping its latest huge numbers, it will become more difficult for it to keep its growth rate so high. And with so many companies loading up on AI chips, Nvidia may be punching above its weight right now. As more competing chips come to market in quantity and chip buyers potentially ease up on their AI-related spending, its growth rate could come down drastically.\nOn the flip side, Apple's growth rate should improve thanks to its recently unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will inject AI capabilities into its latest iPhones, Macs, and iPads. That will give users an incentive to get the latest Apple devices when they come out later this year, so it could be the catalyst for a strong upgrade cycle. As Apple dives deeper into AI and enhances its services, it has the potential to tap into more growth opportunities down the road.\nWhat may be the biggest impediment for Nvidia's stock to rally much higher in the near future is its extremely high valuation of more than 70 times earnings.\nTrading at a much more modest P/E ratio of around 34, Apple could have more room to rise, especially if its growth rate improves. Meanwhile, Nvidia's multiple means it will have a high bar to meet each and every time it reports earnings. That leaves the stock vulnerable to a sell-off should it have a quarter that falls short of expectations or if management offers a forecast that isn't sufficiently rosy.\nWhile things are going well for Nvidia today, that doesn't mean it will be able to maintain its current pace.\nBoth of these stocks make for good long-term investments, but if I were buying shares today, I would pick Apple over Nvidia.\nThere is a lot of excitement around Nvidia now, and that has me concerned that expectations for it may have climbed too high. Apple may not be as popular with growth investors today, but it shouldn't be counted out as it still has a lot more room for growth left.\nAnd Apple is the stock that I think will hit $4 trillion first, beating out both Microsoft and Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "A $50 million fund paid by Apple to settle a class-action lawsuit over faulty butterfly keyboards on MacBooks is about to be shared among affected customers following an approved claim, MacRumors reported.\nAlthough the settlement was agreed to in 2022, a court has only recently issued a payment order, with payouts for approved claims set to be made this month, according to a notice on the MacBook Keyboard Litigation Settlement website. Claims from impacted customers were accepted through March 6, 2023, but it\u2019s not clear why it\u2019s taken so long for the money to be sent out.\nThe issue affected butterfly keyboards on MacBooks, MacBook Airs, and MacBook Pros that were sold between 2015 and 2019. The keyboards were poorly designed and susceptible to failure, and caused numerous complaints about the keys sticking or failing entirely. The issue even prompted one frustrated customer to write a song about it, and it became a hit on YouTube.\nMacBook owners who needed at least two keyboard replacements from Apple within four years of purchase will receive a payment of up to $395, while customers who had to replace one keyboard can expect to receive as much as $125. Those who had smaller issues with one or more keys on the butterfly keyboard can expect to receive up to $50.\nThe tech giant tried to improve the design of the keyboard, but even the third generation had issues. It finally ditched the butterfly keyboard in late 2019, returning to a more conventional scissor switch mechanism that\u2019s more robust and therefore far less likely to fail.\nApple has always denied the allegations made in the lawsuit, and the settlement to resolve the case is not an admission of guilt or wrongdoing.\n"

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have trickled up 15% year to date, lower than rivals like Microsoft and Amazon, and roughly matching the rest of the market. The company has hit some roadblocks during the past year, faced with the aftermath of an economic downturn in 2022, declines in product sales, and missing out on the initial boom in artificial intelligence (AI).\nHowever, recent developments suggest Apple is turning things around. Strategic discounts in China are attracting consumers and significantly boosting iPhone sales. Additionally, the tech giant recently announced the launch of a new AI platform that could elevate its entire product lineup and help it achieve a lucrative role in the budding industry.\nModerate stock growth in 2024 has kept Apple's shares at a reasonable price point, potentially making the company one of the bigger bargains in tech.\nSo, here are three reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.\nChina is Apple's third-biggest market, accounting for 19% of its sales in fiscal 2023. However, during the past year, rising tensions between the U.S. and China have made it challenging for American tech companies to attract the East Asian country's shoppers. Meanwhile, domestic brands like Huawei have gained traction.\nAs a result, Apple's sales in Greater China fell 8% year over year in the fiscal second quarter of 2024 (ended in March). The company has responded to declines by offering aggressive discounts on its products in China, which appears to be paying off.\nReuters reported on June 28 that iPhone sales spiked 40% year over year in May, continuing to fuel a rebound that began in April. While discounts don't often do much for profitability, the sales are more promising in Apple's case thanks to the advanced connectivity between its products.\nApple has strategically created an interconnected ecosystem that encourages consumers to try its other offerings after the purchase of their first Apple product. This strategy means iPhone users are much more likely to buy a Mac when shopping for a computer or an iPad if they need a tablet. And it's the same for the company's wide range of digital services, including the App Store, Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Each of these services lets Apple continue making money on the iPhone years after a consumer has purchased the device.\nAs a result, new Chinese customers will likely generate sales for years in the East Asian nation.\nApple was slightly late to the AI party. As a result, its stock hasn't benefited much from the rally in AI, which companies like Amazon and Nvidia have enjoyed during the past year. However, Apple's approach to AI isn't out of the norm.\nThe company isn't known for always being the first to a new technology. Instead, Apple prefers to observe the competition while researching and honing its technology before presenting a product that often grows to dominate the market. This method has enabled Apple to succeed immensely in smartphones, tablets, headphones, and smartwatches. The company wasn't the first to enter many of these markets, but now it is the leading brand in each of them.\nConsequently, the debut of Apple Intelligence this past month is an exciting development. The new AI platform will bring generative features across the company's product lineup, including a major upgrade to Siri, image and language generation tools, and more. However, the catch is consumers will need an iPhone 15 Pro or higher or a Mac/iPad equipped with an M1 through M4 chip to access Apple Intelligence.\nDespite recent challenges, Apple remains a behemoth in tech with immense brand loyalty. The company's use of AI to boost product sales is promising, and with $102 billion in free cash flow (what's left of cash flow after capital spending), I wouldn't bet against Apple thriving in AI over the long term.\nApple's modest stock gains since the start of 2024 have kept its share price at a better value than many of its competitors. However, improvements in its business suggest it won't stay like that for long.\nThe table above uses two key metrics to compare the valuations of some of the most prominent names in tech: price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value. The data show Apple is potentially one of the bigger bargains in tech, with a significantly lower P/E and price-to-free-cash flow than some of its peers.\nWith recovering product sales in China and a promising push into AI, Apple is a no-brainer buy right now and an excellent option for long-term investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release earnings results for its third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Aug. 1.\nMeanwhile, some investors are eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company currently has a dividend yield of 0.45%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents a share ($1.00 a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple's $1.00 dividend: $6,000 / $1.00 \u00a0= 6,000 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,332,480 worth of Apple, or 6,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares, or $266,496 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nView more earnings on AAPL\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple rose 1.5% to close at $222.08 on Wednesday.\nAnalysts expect Apple to report quarterly earnings at $1.35 per share, up from $1.18 per share in the year-ago period. The company is projected to post revenue of $84.53 billion, compared to $76.41 billion a year earlier.\nOn Thursday, analysts will also be looking at Apple\u2019s streaming results and its ability to balance ad-free plans with\u00a0ad-supported plans. Apple is one of the newer companies in the streaming space and could soon be launching an ad-supported plan.\nRead Next: \nJim Cramer Says This Home Improvement Chain Is A Buy Ahead Of Fed Rate Cut Cycle: \u2018I Would Pick Some Up Tomorrow\u2019\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a program last week tried to make sense of the decline in tech stocks, saying companies with the \u201cbest fundamentals\u201d got \u201chammered once again.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that to happen.\u201d\nCramer said that sometimes it\u2019s difficult to own the \u201cwinners.\u201d The CNBC host said it\u2019s important to understand the bear cases around stocks otherwise you will never know what \u201cyou are up against.\u201d\nJim Cramer tried to find out whether the latest decline in top tech stocks was just a \u201cperiodic selloff\u201d that presented an \u201copportunity.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we get this kind of rotation, you never know whether these stocks are selling off because there\u2019s something wrong or because they are up huge.\u201d\nJim Cramer pointed to a caveat when it comes to holding winning stocks. When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \u201cchanged.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\u201d\nIn this article, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nJim Cramer in a latest program said people were selling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock in April when it was trading at around $165 saying the new iPhone won\u2019t resonate. But when Apple revealed its AI features at the WWDC event, the stock came \u201croaring\u201d back, Cramer said. But then why the stock recently went down? Cramer said that Apple recently \u201cpeaked\u201d at $230 and has run too much.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s ailing it.\u201d\nCramer also believes the anti-China \u201crhetoric\u201d from Donald Trump is also a factor affecting Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares because \u201cthey have big China business.\u201d\nDoes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have any AI growth catalysts? Wall Street is turning bullish on the company after Apple revealed Apple Intelligence plans at the WWDC event.\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it\u2019s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance after unveiling its AI strategy to its software developers. The Company has been at the forefront of proprietary computer processor development for over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well-situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. While revenue growth has been relatively flat post-Covid-19, we expect Apple\u2019s AI value proposition will be compelling enough for consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. Just think about the savvy investors who held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares for the last five years, while they gained 338%. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 30% gain in the last three months.\nSince it's been a strong week for Apple shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n Check out our latest analysis for Apple \nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nOver half a decade, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 354% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nApple provided a TSR of 15% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 35% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Sanghamitra Saha ",
        "Text": "The Apple AAPL stock, which has so far been a laggard in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, has picked up momentum. Apple shares have surged 14% past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 5.8%. Much of the credit goes to its newly announced AI initiatives.\nThe iPhone maker announced its much-awaited generative AI initiative called \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d at its WWDC conference in Cupertino, CA, in mid-June. Apple Intelligence is positioned as a distinctive offering that understands users and their data (read: Bet on \"Apple Intelligence\" With These ETFs).\nUpdates to its iPhone and Mac operating systems will now allow access to ChatGPT through a partnership with developer OpenAI. ChatGPT can also be used to boost other tools, including text and content generation.\nApple Intelligence will be deeply integrated across the company's hardware and software products. It will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro, iPads and Macs running Apple's M1 series chips and newer models starting this fall.\nApple has developed a new cloud service called Private Cloud Compute to ensure user privacy. This service uses Apple Silicon with built-in privacy capabilities, determining if a request can be processed on-device or needs cloud access. Apple assures that no user information will be stored in the cloud.\nWall Street had long awaited Apple\u2019s entry into generative AI, following Microsoft\u2019s MSFT OpenAI-powered Bing chatbot (Copilot) and Google\u2019s (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL) Bard chatbot, now named Gemini. Meta META has also integrated AI into its platforms through recommendation software and the Meta AI chatbot. Amazon AMZN has also been very much in the AI race.\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.68 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.82 a month ago based on 30 recommendations.\nOf the 30 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 63.33% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 56.67%, while Buy represented 10%.\nSince there still are uncertainties related to the success of Apple\u2019s upcoming AI rollout, it is better to track the company with the ETF approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks. Apple-heavy ETFs include the likes of Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, iShares Global Tech ETF IXN and iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Apple Hits 52-Week High: Can AI Focus Drive AAPL Stock Higher?",
        "Author": "  Aniruddha Ganguly ",
        "Text": "Apple AAPL shares hit a 52-week high of $220.38 on Jul 2 and finally closed at $220.27, up 14.4% year to date. Since Jun 10, when the iPhone maker hosted its annual developers\u2019 event, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple shares have jumped 14.1%, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Mini industry\u2019s gain of 13.8% and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 5.8%.Lately, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.Apple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his enthusiasm over the opportunities with Generative AI (GenAI). In the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Cook stated that Apple enjoys a significant advantage in the AI space due to \u201cApple\u2019s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple\u2019s silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy.\u201d\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, has become more natural, contextually aware, and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri\u2019s new design features an elegant glowing light around the screen edge when active, and its functionality extends to providing device support and answering detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.In a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri can utilize ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities, with user consent, to provide more detailed and accurate information. ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide Writing Tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\nApple\u2019s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are noteworthy. As of Mar 30, 2024, cash & marketable securities were $162.34 billion compared with term debt of $102.59 billion.Apple returned nearly $27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 through dividend payouts ($3.7 billion) and share repurchases ($23.5 billion). Its board authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and also raised dividend payout by 4% to 25 cents per share.\nChina\u2019s growth remains a worry for Apple due to stiff competition from local smartphone makers, including Huawei. The Chinese government\u2019s directive to state officials not to use non-Chinese phones for work has been detrimental to the iPhone\u2019s demand.Per Canalys data, the Mainland China smartphone market witnessed 67.7 million units of shipment in first-quarter 2024. Huawei led with a 17% market share, shipping 11.7 million smartphones, while Apple sold 10 million units, down 25% year over year, the most among the top five vendors.The issues forced Apple to cut retail prices, which drove iPhone smartphone shipments in April (up 52% year over year) and is also expected to have benefited May sales. However, Apple is suffering from a lack of GenAI capabilities in the iPhone.\nApple\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.75 billion, indicating 2.38% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has increased by a penny to $1.33 per share over the past 30 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMoreover, Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.63X compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini industry\u2019s 28.58X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.However, Apple\u2019s AI push is hard to ignore. The Services business has emerged as AAPL\u2019s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple\u2019s investment profile attractive.\nMoreover, Apple shares are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "Text": "Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its \u201cPolen Focus Growth Strategy\u201d second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the fund returned -0.11% (gross) and -0.31% (net) compared to 8.33% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 4.28% for the S&P 500 Index. Generative AI (GenAI) remains the dominant market narrative in the second quarter. The portfolio does not own NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies that are presently benefitting from the demand for AI hardware. However, with the portfolio\u2019s extensive investment in software and IT services, the firm anticipates that GenAI's long-term economic gains will go to these industries. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. The one-month return of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was 7.77%, and its shares gained 16.37% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 19, 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $224.31 per share with a market capitalization of $3.44 trillion.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\"\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in 9th position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 150 hedge fund portfolios held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the first quarter which was 131 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nIn\u00a0another article, we discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and shared Wedgewood Partners' views on the company. In the previous quarter, the absence of Apple Inc.

        "Text": "Foxconn Technology Group, which runs the world's largest iPhone factory in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, has started building a \"trial\" electric vehicle (EV) plant there, as it aims to replicate its success as Apple's top smartphone contractor when it comes to cars and other products.\nThe company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, on Tuesday held a groundbreaking ceremony for an \"trial manufacturing centre\" for electric vehicles in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, the provincial government announced on its website.\nThe EV production centre will cater to \"well-known domestic and foreign automobile brands\", with the goal of building the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone, where Foxconn's biggest iPhone factory is based, into a \"core production base for Foxconn's new energy vehicle segment\", the Taiwanese company said in a social media post on Wednesday.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Bloomberg>\nA day earlier, Foxconn reaffirmed its commitment in the region by signing a strategic partnership with the provincial government, during which company chairman and chief executive Liu Young-way said Foxconn \"attaches great importance to the cooperation with Henan\" and promises to \"continuously be rooted and ploughing deeply in Henan,\" according to the provincial government's statement.\nHenan provincial governor Wang Kai said the government \"highly values Foxconn's development in the region\" and expects the company to \"further expand its industrial layout\" and \"keep opening up to new sectors\" there.\nThe relationship between the two parties has not always been stable. Foxconn's production activity in Zhengzhou suffered major disruptions in 2022 after a Covid-19 outbreak led to mass walkouts and worker protests over stringent pandemic controls and wages.\nThe debacle caused shipment delays for the iPhone during that year's holiday season in Apple's home market as well as Europe, prompting the Californian giant to accelerate the shift of some production outside China, to areas including India and Vietnam.\nYoung Liu (centre), chairman and chief executive officer of Foxconn Technology Group.

Last April, the company picked Zhengzhou as the headquarters for its new businesses, with plans for a 70,000-square-metre complex with an investment of 1 billion yuan (US$137 million).\nIt established the Foxconn New Business Development Group in Zhengzhou in June 2023, with registered capital of 1 billion yuan, to conduct business in EV sales and battery production. Another company, Foxconn New Energy Vehicle Industry Development (Henan) Co, was established in January with a registered capital of 500 million yuan.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Mac revenue is expected to increase by 13% year-over-year, thanks to recent launches like the MacBook Air 13\u201d and 15\u201d with M3.\nThe Services segment is predicted to grow by 15% year-over-year, driven by price increases and strong App Store spending, which is up 13% according to Sensor Tower.\nMeanwhile, the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category is expected to see a modest 2% year-over-year decline, although accessories tied to new iPad and MacBook launches should provide some support.\nLooking ahead, Goldman Sachs sees a path for Apple path to achieve $9-$10 EPS in fiscal 2026/27, driven by increased iPhone shipments, new product innovations, and a shift towards premium iPhone models.\nThey forecast iPhone shipments to reach 230 million in fiscal 2024, 240 million in fiscal 2025, and 256 million in fiscal 2026.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Goldman Sachs projects EPS of $1.55 and revenue of $93.6 billion, aligning with the Visible Alpha consensus.\nThey expect Apple to guide for mid-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth, with declines in iPhone revenue offset by growth in iPad, Mac, and Wearables, along with continued strong growth in Services.\nRelated Articles\nGoldman Sachs expects Apple to post an earnings beat\nAvoid this group of chip stocks as the US election approaches: Citi\nUS mine development timeline second-longest in world, S&P Global says\n"

The global premiere of F1 has been planned for Jun 25, 2025.\nApple had onboarded actor Brad Pitt in 2022 and then director Joseph Kosinski for this film based on Formula One racing. The audience received their first sneak peek of the film at the British Grand Prix, leading some experts to speculate that the film's budget could be around $250 million.\nF1 will be streamed on Apple TV+ after its theatrical run, contributing to Apple TV+'s rich content library of award-winning movies. Per a report by Self Financial, Apple TV+ has maintained the top position on IMDb with the highest average IMDb rating of 7.01 out of 10 for its content library throughout 2021, 2022 and 2024.\nFor the rest of 2024, Apple has a lineup of theatrical releases \u2014 Fly Me to the Moon, The Instigators, Blitz and Wolves. Moreover, Wolves will star both George Clooney and Brad Pitt. In 2024, Apple TV+ originals like Palm Royale and Sugar also contributed to Apple TV+\u2019s content pool.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nA report by Statista shows that Apple TV+ had a market share of 8% in the first quarter of 2024 in the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) market of the United States. The leaders in this space, Amazon AMZN Prime Video, Netflix NFLX, Max and Disney\u2019s DIS Disney+, had a market share of 22%, 21%, 14% and 11%, respectively.\nIn the week of May 27, 2024 to Jun 2, 2024, Neilsen reported that the top streaming programs in the United States were Bridgerton streamed on Netflix and Bluey streamed on Disney+. Moreover, among the top-watched originals were Amazon Prime\u2019s Fallout and Outer Range and Netflix\u2019s Bridgerton, Evil, Dancing for the Devil, Eric and Jurassic World: Chaos Theory.\nTo counter its competition, Apple is also expanding in the streaming arena by increasing its content base and improving the quality of its offerings. Alongside TV+ shows, Apple is launching games on Arcade and increasing its footprint globally by launching TV+ in new countries and collaborating with new partners for the Apple Pay feature.\nApple TV+ also has the advantage of being a low-priced subscription model and financial support from Apple Inc. that can enable it to capture more audience, given that Apple keeps increasing its content pool.\nMoreover, Apple is getting into the sports entertainment space with the Apple Sports app, which is free for its users. With this new sports offering, 2,100 award nominations and 480 award wins for both its TV+ originals and theatrical releases, Apple is poised to be a strong contender in the entertainment space.\nAlthough Apple\u2019s entertainment offerings face immense competition from giants, including Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu in the streaming space and Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount and Disney in the theatrical space, Apple has the advantages of a rich content base, free sports content and strong financial support.\nIn the previous quarter, i.e., the first quarter of 2024, Apple set an all-time revenue record in the services segment with $23.9 billion, up 14% year over year. Apple\u2019s services segment accounts for subscription-based services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music and Apple News+.\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has risen 17.6% in the year-to-date period, marginally surpassing the Zacks Computer Mini-computer industry\u2019s growth of 17.5%.

        "Text": "The Free App Is the Fastest, Simplest Way to Capture and Digitize Procedures for Industrial Users\nSEATTLE, July 17, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Taqtile, Inc. has created an exceptionally efficient \u2013 and absolutely free \u2013 tool for creating spatially anchored work instructions for use by deskless personnel in industrial and defense organizations \u2013 Manifest\u00ae Maker. Powerful new capabilities have been incorporated into Maker, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) to dramatically reduce the effort required to dynamically create step-by-step videos on complex procedures. The new version of Maker is available now and supports iPhone, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro.\nManifest Maker enables organizations to capture expert operators doing jobs, procedures, and workflows correctly, then document and share these procedures throughout the organization. Intuitive Manifest Maker tools make creating custom work instructions easier than ever before, without the need for specialized skills or equipment. Completed work instructions, enhanced with AR and spatially anchored content, can be exported to the Manifest platform with a single tap and made available to deskless workers anywhere, anytime.\nExpanded Hardware Support\nIndustrial users now have more hardware options for using Manifest Maker, so they can now leverage the power of Apple Vision Pro, the utility of iPad, and the ubiquity of iPhone. Apple Vision Pro users can spatially anchor content and valuable information for each step, providing helpful context for workers. Manifest Maker 2.0 runs natively on Apple Vision Pro, iPad and iPhone, for optimized performance.\nAI Capabilities Streamline Procedure Creation\nBy leveraging AI, Manifest Maker automatically creates linear, procedural steps out of captured video footage. The addition of AI enables efficient creation of documented procedures, including detailed work instructions that deskless workers can easily follow when conducting maintenance, making repairs, or performing inspections.\nEffortlessly Create 3D Models\n3D models are valuable tools for training and supporting employees, familiarizing them with complex equipment, and helping them follow repair and maintenance procedures. With Maker, making these highly useful models takes less time to create and requires no specialized skills. Anyone with an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro can easily capture industrial objects, and turn them into 3D models for use in Manifest Maker and shared across the Manifest platform.\nWhen designing highly engaging, easy-to-follow visual procedures, Manifest Maker users can drag-and-drop 2D or 3D images into the app from a Scratch Pad. Images and videos stored on shared drives can be accessed from Manifest Maker, then imported for use in work instructions. Furthermore, features like auto-transcribed text and dictated guidance are also built into the tool.\n\"Supporting Apple Vision Pro and its game-changing spatial computing capabilities is going to make it easier to create superior work instructions that will make deskless employees more effective and more efficient,\" explains John Tomizuka, Co-founder and Chief Technical Officer, Taqtile. \"With the addition of AI and other technical enhancements, the new version of Manifest Maker is more powerful, simpler to use, and a more valuable option for industrial users.\"\nCapturing knowledge is critical for maintaining institutional knowledge as valuable employees retire or leave an organization. Manifest Maker can also digitize antiquated paper-based work instructions, and transform existing procedures into dynamic, spatial aids to more effectively instruct deskless workers. With the Manifest platform, deskless workers can access Manifest Maker step-by-step work instructions, digital manuals and guidance, animated 3D models and digital twins, detailed holograms, and other invaluable company-centric knowledge, increasing maintenance and operational efficiencies, and improving overall safety.\nDownloads and Demonstrations\nDownload Manifest Maker here: App Store\nSign up for a demo of the Manifest AR-enabled platform here: DEMO\nAbout Taqtile\nSeattle-based Taqtile is revolutionizing how deskless workers do their jobs.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are \u2018Money Machines\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nAswath Damodaran believes Apple, which is part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks, has become a money machine. In October last year, while talking to CNBC, the professor recommended investors to hold on to Apple shares. He said at the time that the biggest risk for Apple is not being able to catch up on the next upgrade cycle of iPhone. However, he reiterated that Apple has become the company for \u201call seasons.\u201d\nApple is among the top picks of Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives for the second half of 2024.\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in \u201cdenial\u201d about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock\u2019s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): One of the Best Stocks in the Obama Portfolio?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks in former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio.\nFormer United States President Barack Obama took office during one of the worst recessions in U.S. history, yet the stock market reached new highs during his tenure. Stepping into office in 2009, the year after stocks plummeted nearly 40% amid the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Obama made a remarkably well-timed market prediction. On March 3, 2009, just days before the S&P 500 hit an intraday low of 666 and a closing low of 676.53, the then-president stated, \"What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.\" By the time he left office on January 20, 2017, the S&P 500 had soared to 2,263.69, reflecting a gain of about 225% since his predictive remark.\nThe \"Obama Years\" coincided with rapid technological advancements that significantly impacted the stock market. Apple Inc.'s iPhone, introduced less than two years before he took office, exemplified this era of innovation. In addition, during Obama's presidency, billionaire Reed Hastings transformed Netflix Inc. from a DVD rental-by-mail company into a video-streaming giant, revolutionizing entertainment consumption. On the other hand, renewable energy, particularly solar energy, struggled during the president's tenure. Despite the administration's solar subsidies, investors were largely disappointed as those subsidies eventually faded. First Solar Inc., one of the largest U.S. solar equipment producers, saw its stock plummet by as much as 74% due to falling solar panel prices, making it the worst-performing S&P 500 stock of the Obama era.\nFrom speaking at events worldwide to writing memoirs and signing a major production deal with Netflix, the Obamas have led a busy and highly lucrative life post-White House. Michelle Obama's first memoir, \"Becoming,\" published in November 2018, became that year's No. 1 best-selling book. Her second book, \"The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,\" also achieved bestseller status. Similarly, Barack Obama's latest memoir, \"A Promised Land,\" sold nearly 890,000 copies within 24 hours of its November 2020 release. These ventures, along with the six-figure pension that all former presidents receive, have significantly boosted the Obamas' net worth, which is at least $70 million according to the International Business Times. The New York Post, however, estimates their fortune to be much higher, at $135 million.\nOf course, Barack Obama\u2019s income isn\u2019t limited to speaking fees and pensions. Like many other wealthy individuals, he has invested significantly in the stock market. So what does his portfolio look like? When he took office in 2009, Obama, like all presidents, was required to make financial disclosures by law. At that time, Obama held $200,000-$450,000 in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares that tracks the S&P 500 index, according to a report by CBS News.\nOur Methodology\nThese investments were selected from the top holdings of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares, one of Barack Obama's primary investments during his presidency, according to official disclosures. We have provided each stock's trailing 10-year returns to assess their performance over the decade. Data from approximately 919 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024 was also analyzed to determine the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each firm.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy picks 14 small and large-caps every quarter and it has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their trailing 10-year returns.\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\nTrailing 10-Year Returns: 24.83%\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands as a prominent tech giant. Headquartered in Cupertino, California, the company is renowned for its flagship products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Notably, Bloomberg recently reported on May 9 that the tech giant plans to incorporate its own high-end chips in data centers to deliver AI features this year.\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\u201cConsumers may find purchasing Microsoft\u2019s AI PC confusing (calculating whether it reaches 40 TOPS before purchase), whereas Apple directly tells consumers which models can support Apple Intelligence. Regardless of whether on-device AI applications meet consumer needs, Apple has a clear selling advantage from the start,\u201d Kuo said.\nOn June 14, Erste Group upgraded its rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from Hold to Buy, citing several positive factors contributing to the tech giant's favorable outlook. The firm highlighted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s strong customer loyalty and continuous product innovation as key strengths. They emphasized the company's advancements in its Mac lineup, particularly the introduction of the M4 chip, as a significant driver of long-term growth.\nAs of the first quarter of 2024, Insider Monkey\u2019s database revealed that 150 hedge funds held stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), collectively valued at $205 billion. This represented a notable increase from the previous quarter, where 131 hedge funds held stakes valued at $161 billion.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company\u2019s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company\u2019s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio stocks. You can visit Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns\u00a0to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Recommendations.\u00a0Since Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the concept of \u201csuitability\u201d of stocks in investing, which emphasizes the importance of picking individual stocks based on your personal context, circumstances and life goals instead of short-term market movements. Cramer recalled his days at the Harvard Law School and how he used to run to the library to read research reports on companies to dig out information on quality stocks on a week-to-week basis. When Cramer joined Goldman Sachs, an \u201cexecutive\u201d at the firm introduced him to the concept of suitability, advising him never to recommend stocks to people without knowing what they want out of investing. According to Cramer, that \u201cbest semiconductor stock\u201d might not be good for all individuals and therefore it\u2019s necessary to know the \u201ctolerance\u201d and risk appetite of investors.\nAnswering a question during the program, Cramer said technical analysis, including paying attention to RSI values, is \u201cincredibly\u201d important to him and he does not like to buy stocks if \u201ctheir chart is bad.\u201d\nFor this program we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he talked about recently. These include stocks he\u2019s bullish on as well as the ones he recommends selling. We have analyzed each stock in detail to see its fundamentals and know what the Wall Street believes about it. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment with each company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\nA caller recently asked Jim Cramer whether he should hold on to Skyworks Solutions\u00a0(NASDAQ:SWKS). Cramer said \u201cyes.\u201d\n\u201cActually I\u2019d buy them.\u201d\nCramer said Skyworks Solutions\u00a0(NASDAQ:SWKS)\u00a0CEO Liam Griffin is \u201cterrific\u201d and the stock could have a \u201cbig move\u201d amid orders from Apple.\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) makes analog and mixed-signal chips for Apple\u2019s iPhones. Apple accounts for about 65% of the company\u2019s revenue. Wall Street is also bullish on Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) because of the Apple factor. Last month B. Riley increased its price target on Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) to $130 from $96 and said the stock has upside because Apple is a major customer of the company.\nHowever, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) shares fell after the company gave weaker guidance in April driven by soft mobile revenue. Piper Sandler analysts Harsh Kumar and Robert Aguanno said in a note that these mobile headwinds are \u201cshort term in nature.\u201d\nCowen analyst Matthew Ramsey \u00a0downgraded Skyworks Solutions\u00a0(NASDAQ:SWKS)\u00a0to Hold from Buy and also cut its price target to $90 from $125.\n\u201cWe remain encouraged at Skyworks\u2019 efforts to strategically position the business following a difficult recent macro environment, yet see an approximately 10% socket loss that may or may not be temporary as too much to overcome.\u201d\nSkyworks Solutions\u2019s (NASDAQ:SWKS)\u00a0forward P/E is 17.07, lower than the sector median of 24.\nOverall, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Recommendations.

Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future. Munster referred to a latest interview of Mark Zuckerberg in which he said if his company does not keep spending on AI it may miss the biggest opportunity in the next 10-15 years. Munster said Zuckerberg believes this AI spending \u201ccannot slow down.\u201d\n\u201cI am most optimistic because that CapEX number, if you\u2019re gonna boil it down to one point, it\u2019s gonna be higher for longer and it\u2019s good for AI.\u201d\nAsked whether investors should stick with mega-cap AI stocks or move on to smaller companies that could benefit from this AI spending, Munster said that depends on to what degree you believe in the transformative power of AI.\n\u201cIf you are in my camp.. which I think it (AI) will be more transformative than the internet, then small companies and the big companies are going to participate.\u201d\nMunster thinks the AI-led bull market could last for 3-5 years before ending in what he called a \u201cspectacular bubble burst.\u201d\nFor this article we picked the AI stocks Gene Munster and his firm Deepwater Asset Management hold, according to the disclosures on CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Wall Street is turning bullish on the company after Apple revealed Apple Intelligence plans at the WWDC event.\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it\u2019s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA,\u00a0Apple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks.

        "Title": "Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's been nearly impossible to escape coverage on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) over the last year, as its stock has been on a historic bull run, soaring 762% since the start of 2023. The chipmaker's rise dwarfed the growth of many of the most prominent tech companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which saw its stock increase by 80% in the same period.\nThe disparity between the companies' stock growth is significant, considering Apple is the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $3.5 trillion. Nvidia's rally has seen it become the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $3 trillion, putting it third on the list of most valuable companies (after Microsoft, which is in second).\nNvidia's swift rise saw it temporarily overtake Apple in market cap earlier this year, but it didn't last. However, the chipmaker's consistent ability to outpace Apple in growth suggests it's a matter of when, not if, Nvidia will one day be worth more than Apple. Meanwhile, the company's dominance in the chip market and lead over its competitors indicates that day might not be very far away.\nSo, will Nvidia be worth more than Apple by 2025? Let's assess.\nNvidia's recent rally was primarily driven by its dominance in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred hardware for developers worldwide, with Nvidia now responsible for an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI chip market.\nThe company's success in the industry has seen its earnings skyrocket over the last year, even while rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel launched competing products.\nNvidia has taken a massive financial leap Nvidia over its competitors in the last 12 months, with far more revenue, operating income, and free cash flow. The figures suggest Nvidia is far better equipped than AMD and Intel to continue reinvesting in its technology and stay ahead in AI.\nComparatively, Apple's AI competitors are in similar financial positions to the iPhone maker. Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily in the generative technology, even pulling ahead of Apple since the start of 2023, and have the financial resources to do so. As a result, Apple will likely continue to face fiercer competition in AI than Nvidia, which could mean slower earnings and stock growth as it develops in the sector.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's more established position in AI means it's already enjoying major gains from selling its hardware to the industry. At the same time, it remains to be seen if Apple will, in fact, attract consumers to the soon-to-be-launched AI features in its iPhones, Macs, and iPads.\nPast chip trends indicate it will be an uphill battle for Nvidia's competitors to chip away at its leading market share in AI. For instance, Nvidia's share of the discrete desktop GPU market has grown from 65% in 2014 to 88% this year. The company's position has risen despite AMD's investment in the sector, with AMD's share falling from 35% to 12% in the same period.\nA similar example has occurred with central processing units (CPUs). Since 2017, AMD's CPU market share has risen from 18% to 33%. While Intel's position in the industry has declined since then, it has held onto its majority market share, which was 64% as of the first quarter of 2024.\nHistorical trends in the chip market show that once a company takes a dominant position, it can be nearly impossible for a competitor to steal the top spot. As a result, Nvidia will likely retain its dominance in AI GPUs for years, especially as it continues widening the financial gap to its peers.\nMeanwhile, in the first six weeks of 2024, Apple's iPhone sales tumbled 24% in China, while domestic rival Huawei's smartphone sales soared 64%. Apple has responded to the market shift by introducing heavy discounts on its iPhones. However, the situation suggests Apple's dominance in some regions could be more fickle than previously thought.\nNvidia's business has exploded since the start of 2023 and has shown no signs of slowing. Apple has delivered solid stock growth more recently, hitting a new high in its share price this year. However, Nvidia's lead in AI and more extensive financial resources than its competitors indicate it could surpass Apple in 2025.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com - Analysts from UBS issued a research note on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), predicting the tech giant will deliver in-line results for June and September, while cautioning that the market's optimism for FY25 may be misplaced.\nUBS forecasts June 2024 revenues of $84.6 billion, a 3.5% year-on-year increase, with iPhone unit sales expected to reach 43 million, a 2% decrease year-on-year. The firm also anticipates that Mac sales will benefit from easy comparisons, driving their forecast to $7.5 billion.\nAdditionally, they predict that iPad revenue will grow by 10% year-on-year for the quarter.\nDespite these predictions, UBS doubts the likelihood of an iPhone \"super-cycle\" in FY25, arguing that their analysis of smartphone demand by region, previous cycles, income demographic data, and carrier subsidies suggests a more modest cycle next year.\n\u26a0\ufe0fStay updated with the latest market moves using InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\nIn addition, given Apple's current price-to-earnings multiple of 33 times, UBS believes that unless EPS estimates increase significantly, the risk/reward is unfavorable.\nDespite making minor adjustments to their estimates, UBS maintains that FY25 iPhone demand expectations are overly optimistic. They estimate that peak demand for iPhones will reach around 247 million units, significantly below the most bullish investors' forecasts. UBS also notes that the market is pricing in iPhone units 15% above their 225 million forecast for FY25.\nUBS's analysis further suggests that global iPhone share would need to reach a record 22% to underwrite an AI supercycle or approximately 260 million iPhones in FY25. This would be a significant increase from the current 19% share, especially given increased competition from Huawei in China.\nThe note also highlights concerns around privacy, cost, and lack of applications as potential impediments to the success of a GenAI replacement cycle. They point out that almost 40% of respondents in a recent UBS Evidence Lab Smartphone Survey cited privacy as a concern. Price is also a crucial factor for consumers, and any attempt to raise iPhone prices could negatively impact demand.\nUBS rated Apple as \"neutral\" with a price target of $190, reflecting a challenging growth backdrop, higher rates, and an undefined AI strategy.\nRelated Articles\nUBS casts doubt on Apple's FY25 iPhone 'super-cycle'\nF.N.B.

The fine does not place any restrictions on the bank's ability to serve its existing clients.\nIn a statement published this afternoon the Fed said the fine was for \u201cnumerous unfair and deceptive practices and a deficient consumer compliance risk management program.\u201d According to the statement, Green Dot violated consumer law in its marketing, selling, and servicing of prepaid debit card products, and its offering of tax return preparation payment services.\nSpecifically, Green Dot failed to adequately disclose the tax refund processing fee for tax preparation services offered on a third party's website. Green Dot previously announced it had set aside $20 million to help cover the fine. Green Dot CEO George Gresham said in a statement the bank had been working closely with regulators to prepare for the public enforcement action.\n\u201cThe order relates to practices in place years ago, and we have taken and will continue taking meaningful steps to correct and remediate those issues,\u201d Gresham said in the statement. \u201cIncluding significant updates to our processes, our product packaging and marketing.\u201d\nFortune previously reported on Green Dot's work with Apple and Walmart. The bank is part of a recent trend called banking-as-a-service, where chartered banks work with tech companies to help them build services only banks can offer.\nFinancial analyst Timothy Switzer of financial services broker-dealer Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in an investor note that, while the fine is more than the bank initially set aside, it is below the maximum potential loss of $50 million estimated by the bank\u2019s management. KBF estimates the additional $24 million will reduce earnings per share by between $0.35 and $0.44, depending on tax deductibility, representing a 23% to 30% decline relative to its current estimate.\n\u201cImportantly,\u201d Switzer wrote, \u201cthe order did not place any restrictions on GDOT\u2019s business operations, as management expected, indicating that the direct financial impact will be limited to investment requirements.\u201d\nIn addition to the fine, the Federal Reserve Board is requiring that Green Dot hire an independent third-party to strengthen its consumer compliance risk management program, develop an effective anti-money laundering program, and hire an independent third-party to conduct a review of certain transaction activities.\nThe company\u2019s second quarter earnings results are expected to be published on August 8, and should provide further information.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July.\u00a0Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a fresh episode of \u201cMad Money\u201d on CNBC said that while investing isn\u2019t easy, it\u2019s made even more difficult by \u201cauthentic Wall Street gibberish\u201d and \u201carcane technology.\u201d Cramer said that there\u2019s an \u201centire industry\u201d in Wall Street wanting people to think that investing is hard and \u201cordinary people\u201d cannot do it on their own. Cramer said that many people in the financial industry are just \u201cafter your fees\u201d and they aren\u2019t interested in making money from original investing. Cramer said that hedge fund managers and mutual funds make investing look inaccessible and impenetrable.\nCramer said that he\u2019s \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d and emphasized that investing isn\u2019t \u201crocket science\u201d or \u201cbrain surgery\u201d and you don\u2019t need to go to a business school to understand it. Cramer pitched himself as a \u201ccoach\u201d or a \u201ctranslator\u201d who can explain the meaning of complex financial terms to ordinary people.\n\u201cYou can comprehend all the mystical-sounding vocabulary we throw around here as long as you have a translator, a coach like me, who can explain what the darn words mean.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\nTalking about the top performers of the second quarter, Jim Cramer reiterated his age-old mantra of \u201cown it don\u2019t trade it\u201d for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), saying he has remained \u201csteadfast\u201d on his Apple thesis.\n\u201cWe held it through this period for the trust, because we are still believers.\u201d\nCramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0showed at its WWDC event that it can offer the \u201cbest\u201d of AI because \u201ceverybody in the industry wants access to Apple\u2019s massive user base.\u201d\n\u201cThe stock soared when it dawned on the doubters that they can have its cake (access to the best of AI) and eat it too because they don\u2019t have to spend tens of billions of dollars to build out their own collection of data centers.\u201d\nApple is among the top picks of Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives for the second half of 2024.\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in \u201cdenial\u201d about Apple\u2019s AI potential.\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock\u2019s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cApple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Here's Why Apple (AAPL) is a Bullish Stock in a Tough August",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL have come a long way over the past three years to around $222 from $130 at the beginning of January 2021. However, the uptick in the Apple stock has been erratic at times. While the stock gains were 35% and 49% in 2021 and 2023, respectively, shares tanked 26% in 2022 when the company\u2019s product sales hit a roadblock due to the outburst of the pandemic.\nTherefore, investors may be rightfully skeptical about Apple\u2019s performance in the notoriously challenging month of August when several stocks post lackluster performances. However, Apple is experiencing a bullish trend this year, with its shares gaining 15.5% year to date.\nMoreover, Apple\u2019s short-term moving average (50-day) went above the long-term average (200-day) on Jun 13, and the tech behemoth\u2019s shares have advanced almost 4% since then. After all, this phenomenon is a golden cross in technical terms, which is considered a potential indicator of a long-term uptrend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAstute investors should have considered buying Apple stock during the bullish crossover period. However, it\u2019s not too late to place a bet on the iPhone maker. This is because the company has the wherewithal to go far in artificial intelligence (AI) and boost iPhone sales through planned discounts in China. Apple\u2019s stock is also trading at a reasonable price point compared to other tech bigwigs.\n\u00a0\nCompanies such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, to name a few, have gained substantially over the past year, banking on the spectacular growth in AI. However, Apple is slightly late in joining the AI bandwagon.\nBut this is Apple\u2019s trend, the company always gambles with new technology after doing proper research, which helps it to introduce market-leading products. The company didn\u2019t enter the smartphone and smartwatches market in the first place, yet it is now leading such markets.\nApple is introducing a generative AI platform where a series of new products, including language and image generation tools, are lined up. Apple\u2019s brand loyalty will certainly boost sales of such products, and with $162.34 billion in cash and marketable securities (as of Mar 30, 2024), Apple is further poised to invest more in AI.\n\u00a0\nRising trade tensions between the United States and China, coupled with stiff competition from Huawei, have impacted Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China for quite some time. However, Apple seems to have successfully lured Chinese customers in the fiscal third quarter with attractive iPhone discounts and improved iPad margin by refreshing its design.\nThis encouraging development will surely lift Apple\u2019s revenues in the fiscal third quarter. According to market intelligence firm IDC, Apple offered discounts of up to $317 on select iPhone products in China, which is expected to narrow down iPhone sales decline by 3.1% in the fiscal third quarter.\nApple is slated to report earnings for the Apr-Jun quarter on Aug 1, and an improvement in revenues is expected to boost the company\u2019s bottom line. Apple is projected to notch earnings per share of $1.34 for the fiscal third quarter, more than $1.26 a year ago, indicating an increase of 6.4%.\nMoreover, Apple has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 4.1%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has a good chance to exhibit solid earnings growth in the upcoming earnings release, leading to an uptick in share price.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBut it\u2019s just not all about the fiscal third-quarter results, Apple is expected to introduce its iPhone 16 with advanced AI features in September, which could very well propel the iPhone maker to a $4 trillion market capitalization.\n\u00a0\nApple\u2019s modest stock gains compared to its AI rivals like NVIDIA and Amazon so far this year have made it a bargain in a dull August when investors are frantically searching for a better value stock.\nBy looking at the Price/Earnings ratio, the Apple stock presently trades at 33.6X forward earnings. On the other hand, rivals NVIDIA and Amazon\u2019s forward earnings multiples are 43.5X and 40.7X, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThus, investors must pick Apple shares like there\u2019s no tomorrow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 0.5% over the past 60 days, while the company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.8%.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-07-22, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.71. It's currently trading at a price of $224.31. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -44.06%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.43\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.22%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n83.43\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n72.28\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n155.71\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $137.30. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -63.37%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "JPMorgan analysts set a new December 2025 target for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock at $265, compared to the previous December 2024 target of $245. Relative to the current share price, the new price objective implies a potential upside of around 18%.\nJPMorgan analysts also placed AAPL on their 'Positive Catalyst Watch' list.\nThe move comes ahead of Apple\u2019s upcoming quarterly report for the fiscal third quarter.\nAnalysts said they expect investors to start looking beyond 2024 and see AAPL as \u201cwell positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print relative to the shares representing a solid \u201cEdge AI\u201d play heading into the upcoming fiscal years.\u201d\nJPMorgan believes the iPhone maker will reassure investors that the upcoming AI replacement cycle, set to begin in earnest in fiscal 2025 and further accelerate into fiscal 2026, is leveraging a more robust launchpad in FY24. This is supported by better-than-expected revenue drivers for both iPhone and the company as a whole.\nAnalysts project that Apple will beat revenue expectations, driving earnings per share (EPS) upside and likely leading to consensus revisions for full-year earnings. This, in turn, should help ease investor concerns about Apple's premium valuation multiple, analysts added.\nDespite Apple's strong performance over the past couple of months, the stock has only matched the broader market's year-to-date performance.\n\u201cHowever, we see room for that to change once we take into account the upcoming earnings print, and the likely positive revisions to iPhone 16 volumes from the supply chain following the launch, which we expect to act as a catalyst to drive the shares higher than its prior peak multiple of 31x during the 5G cycle,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts continued.\nTheir expectations of a higher peak multiple in the AI replacement cycle compared to 5G are mainly driven by a higher mix of earnings from Services in FY25 versus FY21; the potential for higher peak iPhone volume due to a larger installed base despite lower replacement rates; and a longer cycle driven by advancements in Edge AI capabilities that could increase replacement rates beyond the initial adoption period.\nRelated Articles\nJPMorgan sees near 20% upside left in Apple stock, adds it to focus list\nPolitical storms won't curb military spending boom, defence firms say\nThermo Fisher lifts profit forecast as biotech demand shows signs of improvement\n"

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "The foldable smartphone market is set for a big boost amid reports that Apple is preparing a clamshell-style model, while Huawei Technologies may soon launch a tri-folding handset.\nApple's top-down folding iPhone could come as early as 2026, according to a report by The Information on Wednesday. The US tech giant has reached out to Asian suppliers in recent months to make components for its first foldable handset, according to the report, citing anonymous sources.\nThis would mark Apple's entry into the foldable handset segment, a fast-growing category in an otherwise flat smartphone market. The global market has become crowded with foldables from the likes of Samsung Electronics, Xiaomi, Oppo and Huawei.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nHuawei overtook Samsung as the biggest foldable smartphone maker in the second quarter largely thanks to sales of devices like the Mate X5 in China. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Huawei overtook Samsung as the biggest foldable smartphone maker in the second quarter largely thanks to sales of devices like the Mate X5 in China. Photo: Bloomberg>\nUS-sanctioned Huawei is reportedly on track to launch another foldable handset with the introduction of the world's first smartphone that folds into three sections, with two hinges, according to a report on Saturday by Chinese state-backed media outlet Securities Daily.\nThe prototype is ready and mass production is scheduled to start in the third or fourth quarter this year, according to the report, citing anonymous sources who work in the supply chain. Huawei is also working to incorporate the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into the phone.\nApple and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\nSenior Huawei executive Richard Yu Chengdong said in a live-streamed interview last week that the company has been working on \"the next generation of foldable phones\" for the past five years.\nThe Shenzhen-based telecoms equipment maker filed a patent for a dual-hinge foldable device in 2022, according to records from the China National Intellectual Property Administration.\nIn the first quarter, Huawei beat Samsung to become the world's bestselling foldable smartphone brand with a 35 per cent market share, as the South Korean brand's share fell to 23 per cent, according to data from Counterpoint Research. However, Huawei has largely been limited to selling its devices in China, as restrictions on accessing US technology such as Google services limited the appeal of its products overseas.\nHuawei is likely to continue to prioritise foldable smartphones because of the higher price they command, even as the company faces challenges in securing supplies of its self-designed 5G system-on-a-chip, according to Counterpoint.\nFoldable smartphones are becoming increasingly popular in China, with shipments more than doubling to 7.01 million in 2023 from 3.2 million in 2022, according to a report published by IDC in February.\nHowever, the Chinese foldable smartphone market has been heating up, as major players are forming partnerships and launching new products to grab a greater share of the high-end segment while competing with Apple's iPhone.\nBeijing-based Xiaomi - the world's third-largest smartphone vendor in the June quarter, according to IDC - unveiled the Mix Flip, its first-ever clamshell-type model, and the Mix Fold 4, a book-style foldable, last Friday.\nSamsung, which unveiled its new Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6 models in Paris earlier this month, will add new AI-driven avatar and voice-assistant functions to those handsets using ByteDance's large language model Duobao, the two companies announced last Wednesday.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Title": "Tech in Kuala Lumpur: Apple arrives \u2013 Samsung makes playful jab",
        "Author": "  GlobalData Thematic Intelligence ",
        "Text": "The tech scene in Kuala Lumpur is buzzing with the much-anticipated arrival of Apple's first retail store in Malaysia.\nThe new store is due to open its doors on June 22nd, 2024, in the heart of the city's new Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) central business district. The store promises to be an architectural marvel, featuring a unique, tiered white pyramid design\u2014much like a futuristic version of Paris\u2019 Louvre. This marks a significant expansion for Apple in Southeast Asia, and the new launch joins the ranks of existing stores in Singapore and Thailand.\nHowever, Apple's grand entrance has been met with a playful counterpoint from its biggest competitor, Samsung. In a move that has generated significant buzz, Samsung has secured the naming rights for the nearest train station to the TRX mall and renamed it the \"Samsung Galaxy\" station. This strategic decision places Samsung's name prominently in the minds of commuters and visitors arriving at the very doorstep of Apple's flagship store.\nWhile the move might seem like a sassy jab at Apple, it is a clever marketing ploy. The Samsung Galaxy Station is an automatic landmark, a reference point for navigating the area. Passengers disembarking at the station are immediately greeted by the familiar blue and white logo, subtly reminding them of another technology giant vying for their attention.\nThis playful one-upmanship between the two tech titans adds a layer of intrigue to the arrival of Apple's first store. It highlights the fierce competition within the smartphone and electronics market, particularly in Southeast Asia where mobile phone penetration is high.\nThe \"Samsung Galaxy\" station serves as a constant reminder to consumers that they have choices. While Apple may be the new kid on the block, Samsung has a well-established presence in Malaysia, boasting a loyal customer base and a wide range of products. However, the impact of the station's name on consumer behavior remains to be seen. Will it deter potential Apple customers or raise brand awareness for both companies? Only time will tell.\nBeyond the marketing battle, the arrival of Apple's store and the Samsung Galaxy Station signifies a positive development for Kuala Lumpur's tech landscape. It signals an increased demand for cutting-edge technology and a growing appetite for premium brands among Malaysian consumers. This competition will likely lead to a wider variety of products and services being offered, ultimately benefiting tech enthusiasts and casual consumers alike.\nThe opening of the Apple store is expected to create a vibrant hub for technology enthusiasts. Customers can expect the familiar Apple experience \u2014a sleek and attractive environment with knowledgeable staff ready to showcase the tech giant\u2019s latest products and services. The store will likely attract a significant crowd on opening day, further adding to the excitement surrounding its arrival.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Station, on the other hand, stands as a symbol of Samsung's commitment to the Malaysian market. It acts as a constant reminder of the company's dedication to innovation and its desire to remain a top contender in the region.\nUltimately, the arrival of Apple and the Samsung Galaxy Station marks a turning point for Kuala Lumpur's tech scene. This playful competition between the two giants promises to benefit consumers by fostering innovation and driving down prices.\nWhether you're a die-hard Apple fan or a loyal Samsung user, one thing is certain: the tech landscape in Kuala Lumpur is about to get a whole lot more exciting.\n\"Tech in Kuala Lumpur: Apple arrives \u2013 Samsung makes playful jab\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 15, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Walmart Inc. WMT and Chevron Corp. CVX.\nU.S. stock markets have been on an impressive bull run over the past 18 months. However, the Dow, despite participating in the rally, lagged its peers, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Wall Street\u2019s blue-chip index is up 5.4% year to date. On the other hand, the broad-market S&P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have climbed 17.8% and 23.8%, respectively.\nMeanwhile, the Dow recorded its all-time high of 40,077.40 on an intraday basis on Mar 20 and 40,003.59 on a closing basis on May 17. Technically, at its current level of 39,753.75, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 39,035.26 and 37,365.23, respectively.\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trendsetter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\nWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days.\nApple Inc. has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, AAPL\u2019s competitive position is expected to improve. Moreover, AAPL is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment.\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. AAPL\u2019s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\nZacks Rank #2 Apple has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.8% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\nWalmart Inc. has been gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. WMT has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nWalmart\u2019s strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled WMT\u2019s first-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\nZacks Rank #1 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days.\nChevron Corp. is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen CVX\u2019s presence in oil-rich Guyana.\nCVX seems one of the best-placed global integrated oil companies to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. We expect the company's average output during 2024 to rise 4-7% year over year, due to the PDC Energy acquisition and robust output in the showpiece Permian Basin region.\nZacks Rank #2 Chevron has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Is Most-Watched Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) Worth Betting on Now?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +15%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 15.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.5%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.39 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $83.75 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.4%. The $386.4 billion and $416.79 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.8% and +7.9%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nApple reported revenues of $90.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.85%. The EPS surprise was +1.32%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "From a technical perspective, Apple (AAPL) is looking like an interesting pick, as it just reached a key level of support. AAPL recently overtook the 20-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\nLike other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.\nOver the past four weeks, AAPL has gained 7.6%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.\nThe bullish case solidifies once investors consider AAPL's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 2 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.\nInvestors should think about putting AAPL on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In China, the resurgence of Huawei Technologies and consumer demand during the midyear 618 shopping festival contributed to the growth, Counterpoint noted.\n\"Sales were at the lowest point in a decade in 2023 but the market was quick to rebound thanks to improving consumer sentiment and inventory positions,\" Tarun Pathak, a director at Counterpoint, wrote in a note.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Its global shipments rose 22 per cent year on year in the period, capturing a 16 per cent market share, trailing only Samsung and Apple, according to Counterpoint data.\nThe popularity of the Redmi 13 and Note 13 series, along with a more streamlined product line-up and a stronger push into high-end handsets, helped Xiaomi gain another 2 per cent share in the second quarter.\nEmployees at a Xiaomi office in Nanjing, in eastern China's Jiangsu province, on May 14, 2024.

Vivo, headquartered in Dongguan, is reportedly in talks to sell its stake in an Indian factory to the domestic conglomerate Tata Group, as New Delhi tightens its scrutiny of foreign businesses operating within the country.\nThe combined market share of the top five brands - Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Oppo - declined year on year, primarily due to pressure from Huawei, Honor, Motorola and Transsion Group' brands including Tecno, Infinix and iTel.\nUS-sanctioned Huawei stood out as the best performer among all brands in China, with a 69.7 per cent year-on-year growth in shipments in the first quarter, the latest period reported by Counterpoint.

        "Title": "It\u2019s for the best that Microsoft and Apple won\u2019t be observing OpenAI\u2019s board meetings",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "OpenAI\u2019s board meetings were about to get really weird, with not one but two major customers and partners sitting in as observers. But that awkward situation has suddenly been averted.\nMicrosoft, OpenAI\u2019s biggest partner and investor, has been a board observer since last year\u2019s leadership crisis, in which Microsoft and everyone else were shocked by OpenAI's board abruptly and briefly firing CEO Sam Altman. And, as I wrote last week, Apple, which plans to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, was reportedly about to get the same privilege.\nHowever, it emerged today that Microsoft has dropped its observer role with immediate effect, and Apple won\u2019t take one either. Microsoft reportedly told OpenAI in a letter that its seven months observing meetings \u201cprovided insights into the board\u2019s activities without compromising its independence,\u201d and the role was no longer necessary because \u201cwe have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction.\u201d\nInstead of having board observers, OpenAI said it will now just hold regular meetings with its strategic partners and investors. This seems a far more sensible approach, for multiple reasons.\nFirstly, while European antitrust officials earlier this year dropped a probe into Microsoft\u2019s relationship with OpenAI\u2014they conceded Microsoft had not taken control of its partner\u2014there\u2019s now a broader EU review taking place, covering strategic investments and partnerships across the entire AI industry. Regulators in the U.K. and U.S. are also paying close attention. This is not a time for Microsoft and OpenAI to appear overly cozy.\nSecondly\u2026well, here I\u2019m going to hand things over to Data Sheet reader JE, who wrote me this in response to last week\u2019s essay about the subject:\n\u201cThe issue of letting major customers sit in on board meetings would seem to raise all kinds of issues. As the retired chair of the board of a publicly traded company, I would have real concerns about how we could have functioned with customers or even large shareholders sitting in on what should be candid, serious and confidential discussions\u2026I question how this \u2018observation\u2019 can be helpful if open-ended. Having input and discussion for a defined topic and time in meetings with customers is fine; attending meetings as an observer or participant is not.\u201d\nDoubly so if two competing customers like Microsoft and Apple are both in the room, I imagine.\nSince we\u2019re on the subject of AI, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI startup has decided to build its own data center systems rather than continuing its server rental agreement with Oracle. The Information had the scoop and the man himself confirmed it on X, where he said xAI\u2019s only chance of catching up with more established rivals was to move faster than them.\n\u201cOracle is a great company\u2026but, when our fate depends on being the fastest by far, we must have our own hands on the steering wheel, rather than be a backseat driver,\u201d Musk tweeted.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has for the first time accused another country of using generative AI in a foreign influence campaign, Reuters reports. You will be shocked to hear that Russia is the alleged miscreant\u2014a Russian organization apparently designed an AI-powered bot farm to spread disinformation in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nFinally, Fortune AI maestro Jeremy Kahn has a new book out! It\u2019s called Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future and I for one can\u2019t wait to read it. We published an excerpt yesterday\u2014which appropriately focuses on AI\u2019s potential for surreptitiously influencing people\u2014and you can also read Jeremy\u2019s own rundown of the book\u2019s key themes in yesterday\u2019s Eye On AI essay.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Can Amazon Compete with Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft in the Market Cap Race?",
        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft regained the title of most valuable company in the world after briefly falling behind Nvidia with the latter's recent stock split. However, it's been playing second fiddle to Apple for years and only recently slid into first place since Apple has been under some pressure.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is only in fifth place on the list of U.S. companies with the highest market caps, also behind Alphabet. It has extraordinary growth opportunities in several of its businesses, and the second-highest sales of any U.S. company behind Walmart. Can it become the most valuable company in the world?\nMarket cap is simply the price per share multiplied by the outstanding share count. In other words, it's the total dollar value of all of a company's stock. Amazon stock trades at $193 per share, and there are 10.4 billion shares outstanding, so the market cap is over $2 trillion. That makes it the fifth most-valuable company on the stock market.\nAs you can see in the chart above, Apple had been the most valuable company until recently, when Microsoft took over and Nvidia briefly topped it.\nMarket cap tells investors a few things. Highly valued companies are best in class, and they have proved that over time. Investors have piled in because these companies perform, quarter after quarter, and they're large businesses that drive the economy. In general, you can count on them to deliver, and they're low risk.\nBut highly valued companies might offer less growth for investors, since they're already so valuable. For the top three stocks here to even double at this point, they would be worth more than $6 trillion.\nIs it possible? Yes. But that comes with its own risk, since they would need to sustain their high value. It's easier to see Amazon or Alphabet doubling from where they are today.\nIn terms of valuation, none of these stocks are cheap. They all get a premium valuation for their reliable track records and incredible businesses. Nvidia tops them, trading at 73 times trailing-12-month earnings, and Amazon comes in second at 55.\nAmazon struggled a bit, like many companies, when inflation started soaring in 2022. It rebounded already last year, but the stock only surpassed its previous highs a few weeks ago, and it could be in its best position in a long time.\nOne reason is generative artificial intelligence (AI). It's today's hot topic, but it might have more staying power than other recent trends like cryptocurrency and the metaverse, and Amazon is a major player.\nIt has launched a powerful set of AI tools for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients, and as the leading worldwide cloud computing company, it stands to benefit in a big way from adoption of these tools. According to consulting company McKinsey, as much as 30% of workplace hours could be automated through generative AI, and it could add $4.4 trillion to the economy.\nAmazon is at the forefront of these endeavors, and CEO Andy Jassy recently said, \"I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time.\"\nBut it's not just AI, with Jassy adding, \"We have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity.\" He said that AWS is already a $100 billion run-rate business, and that 85% of global spending on information technology is still on-premises, meaning not in the cloud. That leaves a massive opportunity for further spending in AWS.\nAnd AWS isn't even its biggest business, which is still e-commerce. Amazon has an unbeatable lead in that category globally and accounts for nearly 38% of all U.S. e-commerce. It has made strides in improving logistics to get more deliveries out faster, and as it speeds up shipments, more shoppers rely on it for even more of their daily essentials, leading to a positive growth cycle.\nThe company's fastest-growing business these days is advertising, which increased 24% year over year in the 2024 first quarter. It's a high-margin business, and with its new ad-supported streaming tier for Prime Video, Amazon is finding more ways to monetize its advertising capabilities.\nIt has an edge in this business because when customers see advertisements on the company's platform, they're already looking to buy, and that can lead to incredible conversion rates.\nAmazon can certainly muscle its way to the top of the market-value chain, just as it's pushing ahead and getting closer to becoming the largest U.S. company by sales. Regardless, it has tremendous opportunities in many ways, and its stock is a no-brainer buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n View our latest analysis for Apple \nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Apple grew its EPS by 13% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It was a year of stability for Apple as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Apple?\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$3.5t company like Apple. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$2.2b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.06% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.\nOne important encouraging feature of Apple is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for Apple that you should be aware of.\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nPiper Sandler analysts on Monday reaffirmed an Overweight rating for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised their target price from $120 to $140 in a move driven by strong expectations ahead of the company's earnings report for the July quarter and guidance for the October quarter.\n\"We see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by NVDA set to continue aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter,\" the analysts wrote.\nThe investment bank views the launch of the Blackwell architecture as a catalyst for a new phase of growth, anticipating continued strong demand from cloud service providers (CSPs), enterprises, and sovereign entities. Analysts believe that demand for NVIDIA's upcoming B100/B200 products will significantly outpace supply.\nIn its bullish scenario, Piper Sandler says NVDA could exceed expectations by more than $2 billion in reported revenue for the July quarter, thanks to a recovery in networking supply.\n\"In our view, NVDA continues to be a premier player in the accelerated compute and gen AI end market,\" the analysts added.\nSimilarly, Loop Capital analysts increased their price target for Nvidia stock from $120 to $175, citing the company's potential to significantly exceed consensus revenue and earnings estimates for fiscal 2026.\nWells Fargo analysts have identified Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the \"most favored long among mega-caps\" as the tech giant approaches its second-quarter earnings report.\nDespite mixed hedge fund positioning for competitors like Meta (NASDAQ:META), Wells Fargo believes Amazon stands out due to strong performance expectations and positive forward commentary.\nThe bank's analysts predict an 18% increase in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue for the second quarter, with a sufficient operating income (OI) guidance of $16 billion for the third quarter.\nWells Fargo also plans to closely monitor Amazon's air freight commentary, estimating its impact on third-quarter operating income to be in the $200-$400 million range.\n\"See AMZN as the most favored long among mega-caps vs. META with more mixed HF positioning,\" the analysts stated, highlighting strong investor sentiment towards Amazon.\nThey note that the upcoming second-quarter earnings reports will be critical for understanding CapEx allocation and return time frames, especially given potential changes in AI strategy at AWS following the recent CEO change.\nRaymond James analysts have raised their stock price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $250 from $200, describing the company as \"a more stable AI play for volatile times.\" The firm maintained an Outperform rating on the stock, expecting a slight beat in F3Q24 results and an outlook in line with previous expectations.\nThis optimism is based on recent conversations in the Asia supply chain, TSM results, and China CAICT data, all indicating positive near-term trends for iPhone and Mac sales.\n\"We expect a slight beat and largely in-line outlook,\" the analysts wrote.\nWhile near-term results may not significantly impact the AI narrative, Raymond James remains \"optimistic that upcoming AI features will drive a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle.\"\nThe firm pointed to upward revisions in iPhone 16 builds for the second half of 2024, based on supply chain conversations, and mentioned significant changes to the internals of the iPhone 17, indicating Apple's increased focus on enhancing on-device AI capabilities.\n\"Supply chain data also points to material changes to iPhone 17 internals, suggesting that Apple is looking to do more AI on the device,\" analysts noted.\nApple's unique position in offering on-device AI features stems from its strong ecosystem, advanced hardware capabilities, and a focus on privacy.\n\"We believe Apple is in a unique position to offer on-device AI features given its ecosystem strength, hardware capabilities, and privacy focus,\" the note added.\nEarlier in the week, Baird analysts added Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock as a \u201cBullish Fresh Pick\u201d and increased their target price on the stock to $250.\nThis revision follows Baird\u2019s initial channel feedback, which revealed a procurement units estimate of over 90 million for the upcoming iPhone 16, a significant rise from the low 80 million units of previous iPhone launches.\n\u201cSimilar to the Galaxy S24 launch earlier this year, AI is the driver,\u201d analysts noted.\nThey expect strengthening demand trends in Qualcomm's handset business in the third quarter of the calendar year, following a seasonal trough in the second quarter and a year-over-year comparison trough in the first quarter.\nBaird\u2019s team believes that AI will drive double-digit increases in Qualcomm's average selling prices (ASPs) for various components, starting with the iPhone 16 in the second half of this year. Moreover, initial AI content in high-end phones from Chinese smartphone OEMs will contribute, followed by the next-generation Galaxy platform in the first half of 2025.\nRadio Frequency (RF) ASP and content are also expected to benefit from AI beginning in the second half, driven by higher performance, faster uplinks, and greater integration.\nAdditionally, the investment firm pointed out a strong initial response for Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor in South Korea, as the chipmaker is the first to market in the initial wave of AI in PCs.\nSamsung (KS:005930) has launched Copilot+ PCs based on the X Elite, with demand surpassing initial channel expectations. Besides Samsung, the X Elite is also currently being shipped by HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Acer, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Lenovo.\n\u201cWe would be buyers of QCOM shares on recent share pullback,\u201d the analysts concluded.\nUBS analysts have reiterated their Sell rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), citing substantial downside risk due to overvaluation and challenges in the automotive business highlighted in its latest quarterly report.\nThey believe Tesla's stock, which is currently trading at over 100 times its run-rate EPS of approximately $2.25, has a considerable amount of AI optionality already priced in, resulting in an inflated valuation.\n\"TSLA 2Q24 results showed the stress on the automotive business, just to keep vehicle deliveries ~1.78mm annualized units (which would be -2% y/y),\" analysts noted.\nThe bank pointed out that Tesla's aggressive pricing and promotional strategies to stimulate demand have caused its auto gross margin, excluding credits, to drop to 14.6%, the lowest since the first quarter of 2019.\nAdjusting for higher-than-normal credits and restructuring charges, UBS estimates Tesla's run-rate EPS to be around $0.56, which still includes a strong but potentially volatile quarter for its Energy business.\nLooking ahead, analysts are skeptical about the near-term drivers for Tesla's earnings. While the introduction of a new lower-cost model and increased Full Self-Driving (FSD) take rates could provide some support, the analysts argue that even an improvement of $1 per share in earnings would still leave the stock trading at over 75 times its price-to-earnings ratio.\nThe analysts assert that Tesla's current stock price heavily relies on future AI initiatives such as robo-taxis and Optimus humanoid robots.\nThey believe Tesla's stock faces more downside risk if confidence in these AI initiatives wavers. Upcoming events like Robo-taxi day on October 10 could trigger a \"sell-the-news\" reaction, emphasizing the overvaluation of the stock based on uncertain future opportunities, analysts explained.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: PT hikes for Nvidia, Apple; Tesla downside risk flagged\nWhat are the best trades to position for a red wave in the US election?\nWould the US outperform if Trump wins a clean sweep?\n"

        "Text": "Morgan Stanley analysts are setting a bullish tone for the upcoming earnings season, with specific companies expected to outperform. According to the analysts, investors should watch Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) closely, as these companies are anticipated to deliver strong results.\nAmazon is highlighted with a \"Positive\" near-term view. Morgan Stanley expects Amazon to deliver a significant EBIT beat in Q2 and guide positively for Q3.\n\"We are 17% above Street EBIT\" for Q2 and 10% above for Q3, the analysts noted, driven by North America Retail profitability and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nApple also holds a \"Positive\" near-term outlook. For the first time in over a year, Morgan Stanley sees a favorable setup, expecting Apple to post better-than-expected results.\n\"Street estimates are 4-5% too low for the September quarter,\" the analysts stated. They forecast Apple will achieve $96.9 billion in revenue for the September quarter, which is 4% above the consensus. Driving this optimism are strong iPhone builds, improvements in the Mac outlook, and robust growth in Services.\nEli Lilly is another key player with a positive outlook. Morgan Stanley anticipates that upcoming data from the Phase 3 SUMMIT trial of Tirzepatide/Zepbound in patients with obesity and heart failure will be a catalyst for the stock. The data, expected in Q3, could demonstrate significant benefits beyond weight loss, potentially broadening Medicare coverage and strengthening Tirzepatide's competitive profile.\nThe analysts noted, \"We would expect positive data from SUMMIT (a statistically significant benefit on CV outcomes) to move LLY shares up ~2-3%.\"\nOverall, Morgan Stanley's analysts are keen to see how companies manage margins in a challenging pricing environment and whether high expectations for the second half of 2024 will hold.\nThey also highlighted that earnings revisions for the S&P 500 have been less negative than average heading into the reporting season, suggesting cautious optimism for the broader market.\nRelated Articles\nAmazon, Apple, Eli Lilly: Here's Morgan Stanley's earnings playbook\nAbbott posts Q2 earnings beat, lifts full-year outlook\nCiti sees further S&P 500 upside during 2H24\n"

        "Title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights ",
        "Text": "The U.S. Senate is sometimes called \"the most exclusive club.\" However, I can think of a club that's much more exclusive than the legislative body, which has 100 members. It's the $3 trillion club.\nOnly three companies in the world boast market caps of $3 trillion or more: Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. But this club might be a little less exclusive in the not-too-distant future. Here are three unstoppable stocks that could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 trillion club.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is in the driver's seat to become the next $3 trillion company. The Google parent's market cap currently stands at around $2.3 trillion. At the rate the stock is climbing, it's not out of the question that Alphabet could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia by early 2025.\nMost of Alphabet's revenue and profits continue to be generated by its Google Search business. While some have predicted the rise of generative AI presents an existential threat to search engines, Google has thrived. CEO Sundar Pichai noted in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings call that Google's new AI overviews have increased search usage and user satisfaction with search results.\nGoogle Cloud should enjoy a strong tailwind from AI for years to come. The unit's sales jumped 28% year over year in Q1 with operating income soaring 371%. Google Cloud is especially popular with generative AI start-ups, with more than 60% using its cloud service.\nYouTube is another key growth driver for the company. It's the leader in U.S. streaming with viewers watching over 1 billion hours of content daily. YouTube now has over 100 million music and premium service subscribers, while YouTube TV claims over 8 million paid subscribers.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't too far behind Alphabet, with a market cap hovering around $2 trillion. I fully expect the e-commerce and cloud services giant will also take a spot in the $3 trillion club within the next two or three years.\nLike Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) should deliver strong growth in the years ahead thanks to the demand for building and deploying AI models. AWS is the leader in the cloud services market. I suspect it will stay on top because of the appeal of new products such as AI-powered software development assistant Q.\nAmazon dominates the e-commerce market. Cost improvements in the company's e-commerce platform and distribution network have helped to boost profitability. As Amazon increases delivery speed further, its e-commerce revenue and profits should grow as customers shop online more frequently.\nAdvertising is also an important growth engine for Amazon. In Q1, advertising sales soared 24% year over year on a constant-currency basis. This growth could increase in the future as advertising on Prime Video gains momentum.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has a steeper hill to climb to join the $3 trillion club. The social media leader's market cap of $1.3 trillion is well below the market caps of Alphabet and Amazon. However, I think it's only a matter of time before Meta reaches the $3 trillion threshold.\nThe company is an advertising juggernaut. Its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, reach more than 3.2 billion people across the world every day. Advertisers can' ignore such a massive audience.\nMeta's efforts to more efficiently monetize its products, especially Reels, are paying off handsomely. Profits more than doubled year over year in Q1. The company continues to get better and better at showing ads to the right person at the right time.\nAI presents a major growth opportunity for Meta. In particular, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI-powered business messaging will be the \"next major pillar\" of the company's business.\nYou might think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are no-brainer stocks to buy if they're truly on track to join the $3 trillion club. And you'd be right, in my view.\nAll three stocks have tremendous growth prospects. The growth drivers already mentioned don't even tell the full story. For example, robotaxis could be huge opportunities for Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox units. Meta could be a bigger winner in virtual reality and the metaverse. I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are great stocks to buy and hold.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you\u2019d have $21,904!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $43,562!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $349,245!*\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 8, 2024\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 30, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants \u2014 Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple \u2014gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year\u2019s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\nManagement\u2019s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies \u2013 they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Apple",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "A number of companies' stocks achieved new all-time highs on Friday, July 5, including tech behemoths Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. As a result, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 1% and 2%, respectively, during a 24-hour period.\nThe rally followed news that unemployment had hit its highest level since 2021. Wall Street expects an uptick in unemployment to bring down interest rates, which often promotes growth in the stock market as companies benefit from lower borrowing costs. As a result, now could be an excellent time to expand your position in \"Big Tech\" before it's too late.\nAmazon and Apple are two attractive options, profiting from immense brand loyalty from their customers and the cash to expand into budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI). Let's examine these consumer-favorite companies and determine whether Amazon or Apple is the better stock to buy this month.\nShares in Amazon have climbed 53% during the past 12 months, rallying due to several quarters of impressive earnings growth and expansion into some of tech's fastest-growing industries. One of the most attractive aspects of its business is its diversification.\nThe company has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer 30 years ago. It's vastly expanded its product range to become the biggest name in e-commerce and achieved lucrative positions in cloud computing, video streaming, digital advertising, and now, AI.\nAmazon has growth catalysts across tech, potentially making it one of the most reliable long-term investments. For instance, an economic downturn in 2022 hit the company hard, causing steep profit declines in its retail segments.\nHowever, Amazon remained profitable during the challenging year, thanks to its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the company has since pulled off an impressive turnaround in its retail business, proving its ability to navigate market headwinds successfully.\nIn the 2024 first quarter, Amazon's revenue rose 13% year over year to $143 billion. Its North American and international divisions posted revenue gains of 12% and 10%, respectively, with AWS sales spiking 17%. Also, Amazon's operating income more than tripled, hitting over $15 billion.\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory as sales continue to rise and it keeps investing in its business. This makes its stock a compelling option right now.\nApple's stock hit a record high this week following a rally. Its share price has increased by 17% since its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on June 10.\nDeclines in product sales and a delayed start in AI have concerned investors during the past year. This was reflected in a stock that has risen slower this year than many of its peers (as seen in the chart above). However, the WWDC gave a peek into Apple's plan to boost product sales and carve out a lucrative role in AI over the long term.\nAt the June conference, Apple unveiled a new AI platform it calls Apple Intelligence, which will bring generative features across its product lineup. However, consumers must upgrade to the company's newer devices to access Apple Intelligence.\niPhone users will need a 15 Pro or higher. Meanwhile, only Macs and iPads using Apple's custom-developed Apple Silicon chips can run the new AI tools. The company hopes the new features will compel shoppers to upgrade their devices to access the coming features.\nApple revealed in its Q1 2024 earnings report it had more than 2 billion active devices worldwide. The company's reach in the consumer market is vast, and its deep economic moat is driven by a walled garden of products and a reputation for quality. Apple generated $102 billion in free cash flow\u00a0(what's left of cash flow after capital expenditures), so I wouldn't bet against the company flourishing over the long term.\nAmazon and Apple have become worldwide household names. Both companies can seemingly do no wrong, succeeding in nearly every new market they enter. However, Amazon's quick recovery after macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 and arguably more diverse business model make its stock potentially more reliable and worth considering over Apple.\nThis chart shows that Amazon's financial growth has dwarfed Apple's during the past year. The retail giant is enjoying gains in all parts of its business. Meanwhile, many questions remain about whether Apple's AI expansion will, in fact, boost earnings.\nIn addition to Amazon's price-to-sales ratio of 3.5, compared to Apple's 9.3, the e-commerce company's stock is the better no-brainer buy this year.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $771,034!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, and Nvidia NVDA.\nUS stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs \u2013 if you aren\u2019t bullish now, I don\u2019t know what else to tell you.\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\nThe 'Magnificent 7' continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also show encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet. Also, Nvidia, gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months.\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\nNotably, Apple\u2019s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple\u2019s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\nBased on these developments it\u2019s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise it earns a premium valuation.\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The collaboration quickly became the top trending topic on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, attracting over 110 million views and 21,000 discussions as of Wednesday.\nThe new campaign comes as Apple reiterates its commitment to privacy in China, where consumers are increasingly wary of data security issues and regulators are tightening their scrutiny of how businesses are handling user data.\nPrivacy has also emerged as a key issue as Apple moves to incorporate generative artificial intelligence (AI) in its devices. The company highlighted its focus on privacy in its AI strategy outlined last month, where it promised to handle most of the AI computing on the device, and use its Private Cloud Compute system to handle more complex AI problems.\nThis is not Apple's first attempt to appeal to Chinese consumers' concerns over data privacy. In May last year, the company launched a one-minute video featuring Hong Kong martial arts star Donnie Yen Ji-dan, who delivered kicks and punches when anyone invaded the privacy of iPhone users.\nApple's previous privacy ad featured Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen.

        "Title": "Sequoia Capital invested early in Google, Nvidia, and Apple. Can Roelof Botha keep the legendary venture capital firm ahead in the AI future?",
        "Author": "  Michal Lev-Ram ",
        "Text": "At the crown of Roelof Botha\u2019s otherwise perfectly coiffed, light-brown head of hair, there\u2019s a small patch that\u2019s gone completely white. It\u2019s the result of a serious concussion Botha incurred in his twenties while playing rugby, his sport of choice in his native South Africa and in business school at Stanford.\nThat injury ended his playing days. But spend some time with Botha\u2014who\u2019s now the head of Sequoia Capital, one of the oldest, largest, and most successful firms in venture capital\u2014and rugby will come up again and again. Botha cites lessons from rugby in talks with founders and colleagues, and watches it devotedly while he exercises. The game has provided him with endless analogies about the value of teamwork and resilience\u2014and some decent one-liners.\n\u201cSoccer is 90 minutes of pretending to be hurt when you\u2019re not,\u201d Botha tells me. \u201cAnd rugby is 80 minutes of pretending not to be hurt, with blood spewing on your face.\u201d\nWhile some soccer fans might quibble with the comparison, rugby is, indisputably, not for the faint of heart. Then again, neither is Botha\u2019s other passion: venture capital. The industry that has become a financing pipeline for young, innovative, and risky companies is known for dramatic booms and busts\u2014and it\u2019s coming off a particularly harrowing cycle. A COVID-era bump in demand for all things tech helped VC funds raise and invest record amounts in 2021, as an unprecedented 340 new U.S. startups achieved \u201cunicorn\u201d status, or valuations of $1\u00a0billion or more. Then, in 2022, came a correction, triggered by high interest rates and a slumping stock market\u2014a decline that bloodied balance sheets and left many people wondering whether the VC model itself was broken.\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Botha, who appears to be equal parts jock and nerd (a true unicorn) has taken the mantle. The former wunderkind and charter member of the PayPal mafia became senior steward, Sequoia\u2019s term for its top job, in July 2022. (After a reorganization, his title is now just \u201csteward.\u201d) It\u2019s the culmination of a steady rise: Botha, who turns 51 in September, joined the firm in 2003 and had been running Sequoia\u2019s U.S. and Europe business since 2017, scoring lucrative wins over the years with investments in YouTube, Instagram, and Square, among other blockbusters.\nAll along, Botha has kept a low profile: \u201cMy inclination was never to run to the spotlight,\u201d he says. But leading Sequoia comes with certain demands, not just to set strategy internally but to explain it externally. So far, Botha\u2019s run has coincided not just with VC turmoil but with blunders specific to Sequoia (more on that shortly). Still, the firm has ridden out the downturn better than most. It distributed more than $43\u00a0billion to its investors over the past five years, including $10\u00a0billion in 2023. Its limited partners, largely made up of endowments, charitable foundations, and nonprofits, seem satisfied: Indeed, the base of investors in Sequoia\u2019s primary fund grew slightly from 2022 to 2023, from 354 to 358.\nIt helps that the Bay Area-based firm has delivered hit after hit, decade after decade. Sequoia has led investments in tech titans including Apple, Cisco, and Google, plus newer names like Nvidia, Airbnb, DoorDash, and WhatsApp, minting billions in returns along the way. More than 25% of the overall market capitalization of the Nasdaq\u2014more than $7\u00a0trillion, as of mid-July\u2014is composed of Sequoia-backed companies. Sequoia\u2019s kingmaker position is also evident in less quantifiable ways: Securing dollars from the firm is one of tech\u2019s ultimate seals of approval.\nThat stellar reputation is precisely what makes Botha\u2019s job so hard. The task isn\u2019t so much to fix what\u2019s broken as it is to keep what works from breaking\u2014and not to be the guy who ends a five-decade winning streak. And what\u2019s kept Sequoia at the top in the past won\u2019t necessarily keep it there\u2014especially in a VC industry that\u2019s scrambling to adapt. \u201cI want Sequoia to thrive,\u201d says Botha. \u201cAt an organization that has achieved [so much], this is more daunting. It\u2019s much easier to be the underdog.\u201d\nThat said, there\u2019s a reason Sequoia is the alpha: Its culture from the get-go has been one of near-paranoid competitiveness, ruthless honesty, and a constant need for change. Botha has become a paragon of these qualities: His probabilistic-thinking acumen and factual recall make him a force at decision-making time; his intense curiosity helps him question old ways of deciding. Partners credit him with reshaping the way Sequoia thinks\u2014just in time for a moment of industrywide reset (not to mention an AI revolution).\n\u201cWe\u2019re only as good as our next investment,\u201d Botha and his partners like to say. But any fear of failure on Botha\u2019s part is tempered with a relentless drive to master whatever he pursues, something he internalized as a boy in South Africa, and, yes, on the rugby field. Over the course of several interviews that took place at Sequoia\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, a library in Burlingame, and at his Hillsborough home, Botha kept returning to the ultimate sports aphorism. The steward of Sequoia told me any chance he got: \u201cWinning isn\u2019t everything, it\u2019s the only thing.\u201d\nIn mid-May, Sequoia gathered its partners and founders for a two-day retreat on a cattle ranch in California\u2019s San Benito County. The dusty but picturesque venue was nestled so deep in rolling hills that there\u2019s little cellular reception. There wasn\u2019t even an address\u2014invitees were sent a set of longitude and latitude coordinates and told to download directions before they lost signal.\nDubbed Base Camp, Sequoia\u2019s far-from-Silicon-Valley get-together is a fixture for its portfolio companies. Founders from all over the world attended this year\u2019s event, which featured master classes on \u201ceffective founder storytelling\u201d and \u201cclear thinking,\u201d plus a paella dinner under the stars. There were talks from Jensen Huang of Nvidia (a Sequoia investment in 1993), Fidji Simo of Instacart (Sequoia-funded in 2013), and the former captain of South Africa\u2019s rugby team (of course), who bore an uncanny resemblance to Botha.\nBut Base Camp is also about camping. Just a short walk from the barn where the talks took place was a grassy field dotted with neat rows of cream-colored yurts, the sleeping quarters for attendees. \u201cThe first year, it was so cold I thought we were going to die,\u201d says Julia Hartz, cofounder and CEO of ticketing platform Eventbrite, one of Botha\u2019s investments. \u201cIt\u2019s so Sequoia to take founders out and try to kill them just to prove a point.\u201d\nWhile this year\u2019s weather was milder, the tone set by Sequoia was similarly ascetic. The message, repeated in toasts and talks and even spelled out in a book given to founders, was clear: Being an entrepreneur, especially one backed by Sequoia, means embarking on a journey that requires intellectual honesty and grueling work. Shared outdoor bathrooms? Sleeping in yurts? These elements were to be embraced, not just endured, in the spirit of building grit and resilience. \nSequoia has long been known for this demanding, direct ethos. The approach isn\u2019t just for founders: Its internal culture is one of radical candor and open disagreement. Partners have veto power over deals. For each funding decision, the process includes a \u201cblind\u201d pre-vote meant to discourage groupthink. Botha sometimes pushes partners to reargue a case if he feels they\u2019re being too positive.\nThe steward has also welcomed pressure-testing from Sequoia\u2019s own investors. \u201cHe\u2019s always looking for critical feedback, which is not something you hear from many firms,\u201d says Eric Doppstadt, chief investment officer of the Ford Foundation, the first LP to invest in Sequoia.\nSince taking over, Botha has had ample opportunity to receive such feedback, both solicited and unsolicited. There was the firm\u2019s 2023 decision to decouple from its China business, partly because of deteriorating relations between the U.S. and China\u2014a move some thought was overdue. A boardroom spat last winter at Swedish fintech Klarna, involving former and current Sequoia partners, created embarrassing optics.\nBut perhaps the biggest blight was the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in November 2022. Sequoia invested $150\u00a0million in FTX, all of which it lost, and critics savaged the firm for failing to better vet the company. (FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was later convicted of a massive fraud.) Botha ran to the fire: He quickly organized a call with investors both to apologize for the massive loss of capital and to offer concrete ways Sequoia would improve its due diligence.\nLPs were mollified, and some were impressed. It was yet another twist in a rocky year\u2014and another reminder that the firm can never stop adapting. \u201cIt\u2019s not a profession where you master it and you\u2019re done,\u201d he says. \u201cThe business keeps changing, and the technologies you invest in keep changing, and you need to constantly reinvent yourself.\u201d\nOne of the ways Botha has tried to reinvent Sequoia is by departing from the traditional 10-year cycle of VC funds. Such funds usually reap their returns through startup \u201cexits\u201d\u2014IPOs or acquisitions. But they often miss out on the enormous value\u00a0that can be created\u00a0after a company goes public. What\u2019s more, funds\u2019 10-year timelines can induce angst when exits slow down due to short-term market downturns\u00a0or crackdowns on M&A activity.\nThat\u2019s why, in February 2022, Sequoia launched the Sequoia Capital Fund, an \u201copen-ended liquid portfolio\u201d whose holdings include post-IPO equity in portfolio companies, along with allocations in more traditional funds. The firm is going all in, reorganizing itself around this new structure. Botha\u2019s timing was unlucky, as tech stocks tanked that year. But in some ways, that was the point: The strategy is meant to help Sequoia capitalize on investments over the long term, whether the market is up or down.\nBotha has also had to be creative when it comes to providing more immediate liquidity to investors , due to the current scarcity of opportunities for startup exits on both the IPO and acquisitions fronts\u2014and, in some cases, a slower-than-average timeline for building companies. In mid-July, Sequoia wrote a letter to its LPs, announcing that it would purchase up to $861 million of their shares in Stripe, a fintech investment the firm first made in 2010. The offer was made to those LPs who had invested in Sequoia\u2019s \u201cLegacy Funds,\u201d those raised more than 10 years ago, and the acquiring entities would be newer funds, including the Sequoia Capital Fund. The move, according to Sequoia, was meant to offer LPs looking for liquidity a way to cash out on some of their holdings in Stripe. But it was also a message that the firm was doubling down on its faith in Stripe\u2019s long-term success, which the company\u2019s founders, a pair of Irish brothers whose Bay Area-based startup is now valued at $70 billion, heard loud and clear.\n\u201cMaybe Stripe has stayed private for longer than the external world anticipated, but it\u2019s not longer than we anticipated,\u201d says cofounder Patrick Collison, who explains that because Stripe is an \u201cinfrastructure\u201d company, providing a new technology platform for payments, it takes longer to build than, say, a stand-alone app. \u201cThe good news about infrastructure companies is that they can become very large, and the bad news is that it takes decades for the story to play out.\u201d\nWhile some LPs might want or need liquidity much earlier than that, Botha certainly has the temperament to analyze Sequoia\u2019s investments, and just about every other decision in his life, with an eye for future outcomes.\u00a0\u201cHe very much focuses on passing the marshmallow test of what he wants to accomplish for the long term,\u201d says Alfred Lin, a Sequoia partner who joined the firm in 2010.\nBotha is indeed measured, analytical, methodical: He can barely have a conversation without bringing up probability distribution curves. At times, listening to him is like reading the world\u2019s most eclectic encyclopedia. He can break down the impact of cold-water currents on Bay Area microclimates just as easily as he explains the workings of a rugby scrum. Even when telling jokes (he keeps a book of them at his bedside), he delivers humor with a didactic twist.\nBut everything he says is tinged with the soft accent of Afrikaans, his mother tongue. That\u2019s a reminder of the unusual path that eventually led him to Sequoia\u2014and of the hidden layers of his personality.\n\u201cDid you know he makes jerky from exotic meats?\u201d Hartz of Eventbrite tells me. \u201cSeriously, you should ask him what he eats for breakfast.\u201d\nThe next time I see Botha, I do just that, and he proceeds to rattle off the day\u2019s protein-heavy menu. \u201cThis morning, it was some raw salmon and chicken meatballs,\u201d he says. \u201cYesterday I had bison.\u201d Venison, impala, and whole chickens\u2014we\u2019re talking feet and head still on\u2014are also staples in Botha\u2019s fridge. (A private chef handles the decapitating and cooking.) The avid foodie likes to say that a meal without meat is a snack\u2014a common attitude in his home country.\nBotha was born to a pair of star-crossed teenagers in Pretoria in 1973. His parents split when he was 3; he grew up with his mother but remained close to his dad\u2019s side of the family. He is named for his paternal grandfather, an Afrikaans tradition. \u201cAt my baptism, there is a photo of four generations of Roelof Bothas,\u201d he says: his dad, his grandfather, his great-grandfather, and himself. (Later, his dad would have another son and name him \u2026 Roelof Botha.)\nIt\u2019s Botha\u2019s grandfather who loomed largest in his life. Nicknamed Pik, the elder Botha served as South Africa\u2019s foreign minister in the last years of the apartheid regime, later joining Nelson Mandela\u2019s government after democratic elections ended apartheid. As a child, Botha had rare exposure to global dignitaries and business leaders who came to meet his grandfather. One of his earliest memories is of walking in his grandfather\u2019s garden with Pik as journalists photographed the two of them. \u201cI had a sense of the impact that somebody can have in the world,\u201d he says of those days.\n$43 billion\nBut that understanding went hand in hand with immense pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a burden you carry,\u201d says Botha, \u201cthat I\u2019m named after this person, and I have to live up to this person.\u201d There was another downside: Some assumed that any recognition he received was the product of nepotism. \u201cNo matter how well he did in something, it must have been because of \u2026 well, you can finish that sentence,\u201d says Doug Leone, Sequoia\u2019s former senior steward, whom Botha succeeded in 2022. \u201cAnd that just drove him crazy.\u201d\nIt also drove him to distinguish himself. In elementary school, Botha scored so high on an aptitude exam that the district brought in a psychologist for an assessment\u2014and to make sure he wasn\u2019t cheating. He studied up on how to study, reading books about best test- and note-taking tactics. (His handwriting is freakishly neat.) In college, he picked one of the most grueling majors, actuarial science\u2014and earned the best undergraduate grade point average in the history of the University of Cape Town.\n\u201cWhile other kids were spending their spring break surfing, Roelof and I met in \u2018nerd camp,\u2019\u201d says Matt Rabinowitz, a fellow South African and the cofounder and CEO of genetic testing company Natera, which became a Sequoia investment in 2007.\nBotha applied the same drive to his extracurriculars: playing for the top rugby team at his high school, competing in math and science \u201cOlympiads.\u201d It was around this time that the family doctor approached his mom and stepdad to express concern that Botha would burn out because of his obsessive studying and the intensity with which he approached pretty much everything. His response was to double down. \u201cI was like, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d says Botha.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Roelof has ever had less than 100% on any exam,\u201d says Leone, with hints of both admiration and disgust in his voice.\nSo straitlaced and focused was he that it was his mom who suggested he get an earring. He refused. To this day, Botha doesn\u2019t curse, saying that profanity is a \u201csloppy\u201d way of expressing yourself.\nDespite his stellar record in South Africa, Botha felt that the only way to truly make a name for himself was to go somewhere where his name didn\u2019t mean anything to anyone. After college, Botha worked for consultant McKinsey\u2019s local office, where one of his managers, a Stanford alum, suggested that Botha apply for its business school. Botha made the cut, packed his bags, and landed in Palo Alto at the age of 24.\nSoon enough, he fell in love with Silicon Valley and its seemingly endless opportunities\u2014and with his future wife, Huifen Chan, a fellow Stanford student. True to his track record, Botha graduated at the top of his class\u2014this time without anyone assuming he had received preferential treatment. And yet it was a South African connection that propelled him into the center of the action.\nIn the fall of 1999, a Stanford classmate introduced Botha to Elon Musk, a fellow South African who was running an online bank called X.com. Musk saw something in Botha and worked hard to persuade him to come to X.com, which was about to merge with another firm to create what would become PayPal.\nBotha, who had assumed he\u2019d end up working with something cerebral like exotic derivatives, finally joined the startup in the spring of 2000. \u201cI took the plunge,\u201d says Botha. \u201cAnd then, two weeks later, the Nasdaq crashed.\u201d But even in those dark moments, there was the thrill of being a part of something potentially big and belonging to a team of intense, opinionated high performers. This was the group that Fortune later christened the PayPal mafia\u2014a cadre of future A-list investors and founders that also included Peter Thiel, David Sacks, and Reid Hoffman.\n\u201cWe all worked very hard and yet he stood out,\u201d says Max Levchin, another PayPal mafioso, who is now cofounder and CEO of a fintech company called Affirm. Botha was distinct not just because, as Levchin recalls, the South African used the word \u201cspectacles\u201d instead of simply saying \u201cglasses.\u201d He had a quiet but fierce drive to win. And he was a team player.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t require the center of the stage,\u201d says Levchin.\nFor all its talent, PayPal faced significant obstacles\u2014including, increasingly, Musk himself. Musk was advocating unpopular moves, like killing off the PayPal brand even though consumers liked it. Botha became part of a core group that campaigned to remove Musk as CEO. \u201cThere were a lot of people at the company who thought I was his golden boy,\u201d says Botha. \u201cBut he was not running the company well.\u201d\nWhile Musk was on his honeymoon, Botha and other mutineers met with PayPal\u2019s lead investors to make their case. Those investors? Sequoia Capital. Musk was soon ousted, and Botha caught the eye of Sequoia partner Michael Moritz, who sat on PayPal\u2019s board, and was co-head of Sequoia, along with Leone.\u00a0Botha later became CFO, and working with Sequoia on PayPal\u2019s IPO deepened the relationship.\nSequoia was already a Silicon Valley legend. Don Valentine, a former semiconductor exec famed for his eye for talent, started the firm in 1972. His first investment was in a fledgling video game company called Atari, which eventually sold to Warner Communications for a then unheard-of $28\u00a0million, a 3x return. An even better return on that investment was an introduction to a young technician at Atari: Steve Jobs. In 1978, Valentine put $150,000 into Apple, and the rest was tech history.\nFrom the get-go, Sequoia\u2019s culture was unique among a growing crop of fledgling VC firms. While its initial logo more closely resembled a marijuana leaf, its branding was all about longevity and stability\u2014Sequoias, one of the largest trees in existence, can live for thousands of years.\n\u201cDon didn\u2019t name it \u2018Valentine Ventures,\u2019\u201d says Doppstadt of the Ford Foundation. \u201cHe wanted to convey that there was something larger than him involved in the firm.\u201d\nDoppstadt refers to Botha as Valentine\u2019s \u201cspiritual grandson,\u201d saying the younger investor exemplifies the \u201cspirit of Sequoia.\u201d But in the earlier days of his career, Botha wasn\u2019t an obvious fit.\nIn 2003, after a monthslong interview process, Botha was on the verge of getting an offer. But some Sequoia leaders worried that Botha was missing a critical strand in his DNA: a humanity gene, as Leone calls it. Leone recalls partners wondering: \u201cIs he normal? Can we work with him? Can he be part of a team?\u201d Leone says Valentine himself wondered how Botha would handle failure, given that he\u2019d had so much success. (Valentine died in 2019.)\nLeone was tasked to suss out what Botha was really like. \u201cWhen I started going there, we talked a lot about rugby,\u201d says Leone. \u201cI don\u2019t know rugby, but Roelof swears there is no team sport like rugby.\u201d And talking about extreme competition and teamwork, it turned out, uncovered Botha\u2019s emotive side. Indeed, those who know Botha best describe him as unexpectedly sentimental. (During our conversations, Botha teared up several times\u2014once, for example, when talking about his late stepfather, who played a pivotal role in his life.)\nProving his ability to emote was critical to Botha\u2019s hiring; keeping feelings in check eventually proved just as important. Botha hit a home run early on, investing in 2005 in a little-known video-sharing site called YouTube, which Google acquired for $1.65\u00a0billion just a year later. But then he entered what VCs call the Valley of Despair\u2014when bets aren\u2019t paying off, or worse, are leading to loss after loss.\u00a0 \nBotha credits Leone and Jim Goetz, another senior partner, for supporting him without coddling him. The experience gave Botha empathy for the failures that almost all founders go through. He often talks about \u201ccrucible moments\u201d that shape the trajectory of a company or entrepreneur. This was one of his own.\nHe eventually snapped his losing streak, investing in companies including Instagram, Tumblr, and genetic-testing company Natera, all of which earned substantial exits. For years, Botha wrote \u201c10 to the power of 9\u201d at the right-hand corner of each sheet of paper in his copiously filled, impeccably legible notebooks. It was a reminder of a goal he had set for himself: to produce $1\u00a0billion in gains for Sequoia. He hit that milestone in 2015.\nHe also repaired the relationship that had launched his Silicon Valley career. About a decade ago, Botha and Musk sat down for lunch at Tesla headquarters. For the first time, they spoke about their upbringing in South Africa. \u201cWe both felt empathy for each other,\u201d says Botha. \u201cThat rekindled our ability to have a conversation.\u201d\nIt also opened the door to investments in Musk\u2019s new companies. In May 2022, Sequoia announced that it had contributed to Musk\u2019s $44\u00a0billion takeover of Twitter, creating the roller-coaster-riding company now known as X. Sequoia was not an early backer of SpaceX, to Botha\u2019s regret, but it placed a late-stage bet on the company in 2019. And this year, it invested in yet another Musk company, participating in a $6\u00a0billion round of funding in xAI\u2014part of a focus on artificial intelligence that has become a hallmark of Botha\u2019s stewardship. \nSequoia is no AI newbie. The firm put money in OpenAI in 2021, before ChatGPT was cool. But under Botha, it has increased the intensity of its AI focus: Last year, 60% of Sequoia\u2019s new investments were AI-focused; in 2024 so far, it\u2019s made at least 10 such investments.\nWhen I talk with Botha in mid-June, he\u2019s pondering a new puzzle: AI\u2019s sky-high computing costs. \u201cIt\u2019s unsustainable at this level,\u201d he says. But he\u2019s jazzed about a new Sequoia startup called Fireworks. He explains that its goal is to make inference\u2014the process of deploying AI to draw conclusions from new data\u2014\u201cway less expensive.\u201d The company that reaches that goal, he implies, could have Google-like upside.\nWhatever tech Sequoia is assessing, Botha wants it to do so with a fresh mindset. Jim Goetz, who was Sequoia\u2019s steward for the U.S. and Europe until he passed the baton to Botha in 2017, says Botha has reshaped the firm\u2019s decision-making strategy in fundamental ways. Botha has rolled out \u201cpre-parades\u201d\u2014thought experiments in which partners imagine not just what can go wrong but the best-case scenario of each potential investment. He\u2019s also brought in learnings from behavioral psychology, including prospect theory, which asserts that people feel losses more deeply than gains, sometimes leading to faulty decisions. \u201cWe\u2019ve modified our entire investment process to benefit\u201d from such approaches, Goetz says.\nBotha has also emphasized becoming more friendly and transparent with entrepreneurs. Sequoia\u2019s longtime kingmaker status led it to come across as elitist to some. But Botha has helped combat that perception, multiple founders told me.\nJack Dorsey first pitched Sequoia on his payment player Square in 2010. \u201cThey were preachy and condescending,\u201d Dorsey says of the firm; still, he wanted, and eventually got, Botha on his board. \u201cAs the former CFO of PayPal, Roelof had a bunch of experience we wanted,\u201d recalls Dorsey. \u201cThe most helpful thing that any board member can do is provide context, and he\u2019s done a lot of that.\u201d\nBotha, Dorsey adds, remains \u201cthe only investor that\u2019s reached out to ask what his firm can do better.\u201d (Dorsey told Botha that Sequoia should encourage more engineers to contribute to open-source code; Botha took it to heart, starting an open-source fellowship program.) Today, Botha remains a director at Block, the company Square eventually became a part of; he also sits on the boards of eight other companies, including MongoDB and Unity Technologies.\nKevin Systrom, the cofounder of Instagram, says his relationship with Sequoia, which joined his series\u00a0B round in 2012, was also built on rapport with Botha. \u201cHe\u2019s not your typical VC sales guy archetype, where he\u2019s schmoozing you and taking you to play golf, and I really found myself drawn to that,\u201d says Systrom.\nThere\u2019s another way in which Botha does not fit the VC mold, or at least the archetype that\u2019s emerged in recent weeks: While some Silicon Valley investors have come out in support of one presidential candidate or another (a growing number of them, like the founders of Andreessen Horowitz and some of Sequoia\u2019s own partners, are endorsing former President Donald Trump), Botha has doubled down on his neutrality.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no individual or party that perfectly expresses my opinions, so I just don\u2019t like the idea of so publicly lining up with anybody,\u201d Botha tells me in June. \u201cThat\u2019s just not who I am.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s another reason Botha is staying out of the political fray. While individual Sequoia partners are free to endorse candidates and contribute to political campaigns, the firm itself does not take a position\u2014and it does not donate money to any candidates. As the firm\u2019s steward, Botha is well aware that he\u2019s not just representing himself with both his words and actions.\n\u201cWhat I say is probably more personally associated with Sequoia than it would be for somebody else,\u201d Botha says. \u201cI think me as an individual would have more freedom to speak differently if it was 10 years ago and I wasn\u2019t in a leadership position. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d\nTo be sure, that sense of brand affiliation with the firm didn\u2019t stop Sequoia\u2019s former chiefs, Leone and Moritz, from expressing their own firmly-held beliefs when they were in charge. (And both still do.) But even then, Botha says it was done in the style of Sequoia\u2014ruthlessly honest, yes, but also practical.\n\u201cMichael was a staunch Democratic, Doug was a staunch Republican,\u201d says Botha. \u201cMichael would write articles criticizing Trump, and Doug would publicly support him and donate money to him. And then the two of them would work on something. I think that\u2019s the culture we\u2019ve had.\u201d\nBotha\u2019s political neutrality doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not opinionated when it comes to regulatory decisions that impact Sequoia. In fact, the current administration\u2019s more aggressive stance on antitrust laws and scrutiny on Big Tech is part of what drives the new approach at the firm.\nToday, Botha says his biggest priority is keeping Sequoia involved throughout the life cycle of great companies\u2014getting in on very-early-stage deals and staying invested even as they grow past the startup stage. It\u2019s a huge competitive advantage, he asserts, to be able to partner with companies from concept to long after an IPO.\nOne initiative with that aim, launched in 2022, is Arc, an \u201cimmersion program\u201d for early-stage startups. Entrepreneurs accepted into the five-week program are taught \u201cthe Sequoia way to start, build, and scale enduring companies.\u201d They\u2019re also given funding\u2014and the right to say they raised money from Sequoia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks who would probably say, \u2018Just don\u2019t do that, just go invest,\u2019 \u201d says Jess Lee, a partner on Sequoia\u2019s early-stage team. But Botha, she says, \u201cis willing to both fund and invest and believe in those new ideas.\u201d\nInnovating is critical, says Botha, given the iffy landscape for startup exits. Historically, slightly more than half of Sequoia\u2019s exits have been through M&A. As regulators have moved to curb Big Tech, however, it has become difficult for companies to get acquired. This concerns Botha, who sees the overall health of the VC sector as vital to the broader economy. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a single technology company that is a public company in the last 20 or 30 years that wasn\u2019t VC-backed along the way,\u201d he says.\nAs for his own success, he\u2019s changed the metrics. It\u2019s no longer his own goals, or the \u201c10 to the power of 9\u201d number in the corner of his notebook: It\u2019s collective success that counts. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not personal winning now,\u201d says Botha. \u201cIt\u2019s the winning of us as a team.\u201d And a tight-knit team is invaluable\u2014because in venture capital, just like in rugby, another fiercely competitive scrum is always just around the corner.\nA version of this article appears in the August/September 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \"Sequoia is a VC giant. Can Roelof Botha keep it growing?\" \nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETF featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.\nNVIDIA Corporation has experienced an impressive 146.6% surge in its stock price year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 Generalindustry and The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF\u2019s gains of 106.3% and 19.1%, respectively. This YTD performance makes the graphic processing unit (GPU) maker the third publicly traded U.S. company alongside Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., which currently have a valuation of more than $3 trillion.\nWith a market capitalization of $3.414 trillion as of Jul 2, Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world. Apple holds the second spot with a market capitalization of $3.378 trillion, while NVIDIA is in the third position with a market capitalization of $3.058 trillion.\nAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and autonomous vehicles. Given this remarkable growth, the question arises whether it is too late to buy into NVIDIA or if there is still room for further appreciation.\nNVIDIA's remarkable stock performance has been primarily driven by the anticipation that the company will reap substantial benefits from the growing investments in generative AI. Given NVIDIA's leading position in this space and the vast opportunities generative AI presents, the stock seems poised to maintain its upward trajectory throughout the year.\nThe increasing demand for workflow modernization across various industries is expected to elevate the need for generative AI applications. According to a recent report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nHowever, generative AI requires extensive expertise for content creation and significant computational power. As a result, enterprises developing generative AI-based applications will need to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA's next-generation chips, renowned for their high computing power, are likely to become the preferred choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s GPUs are already widely used in AI models, which is expanding NVIDIA\u2019s presence in emerging markets such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nThe generative AI revolution is expected to drive substantial demand for NVIDIA's next-generation, high-computing power chips. With the increasing AI investments in the data center sector, NVIDIA anticipates its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $28 billion from $13.51 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nNVIDIA's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity. Moreover, the shares of NVIDIA are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\nThe company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging NVDA\u2019s potential for sustained long-term growth. NVIDIA boasts an impressive long-term expected earnings growth rate of 37.6%, significantly outpacing the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s growth rate of 18.9%. This semiconductor company\u2019s earnings have consistently exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 24%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $117.55 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of approximately 93%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $2.53 per share over the past seven days, which calls for year-over-year growth of 113.4%.\nFinancially, NVIDIA is on solid ground, with ample cash reserves that provide a cushion against market volatility. As of Apr 28, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $31.44 billion, up from $25.98 billion on Jan 28, 2024.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23.01, which is higher than the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s forward P/S multiple of 19.2. While this might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to NVIDIA's consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and currently boasts a Growth Scoreof A, making it a highly attractive investment option, according to Zacks' proprietary methodology. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "The Art of Valuation: Discovering Apple Inc's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nAs of 2024-07-08, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $155.71. It's currently trading at a price of $226.34. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -45.36%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.43\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.31%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 16.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n83.43\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n72.28\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n155.71\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $137.30. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -64.85%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "1 Phenomenal Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are having a dramatic impact on the technology landscape, which is evident in the market value of some of the world's most technologically advanced businesses. What many of these companies have in common is that they're trailblazers in AI.\nApple is currently the leader (as of this writing), with Microsoft currently at No. 2, with market caps of $3.4 trillion and $3.3 trillion, respectively. Nvidia's ascent has been breathtaking, adding nearly $2 trillion in value over the past year and climbing to $2.9 trillion to take the No. 3 spot. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- all at the forefront of the AI revolution -- boast market caps of $2.2 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $387 billion, it might seem like a longshot to suggest that Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) might be in the running for membership in the $1 trillion club. However, an examination of the company's recent results and commentary from management suggests the adoption of generative AI could push the company to new heights over the next few years.\nOracle is in an enviable place in the AI revolution. It offers cloud, database, and enterprise-software solutions that are relied upon by 98% of the global Fortune 500 companies. Oracle's information technology (IT) expertise makes it one of the go-to sources for enterprises looking to adopt generative AI solutions.\nThis has helped fuel solid overall growth. During Oracle's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended May 31), revenue of $14.3 billion grew 3% year over year, while operating income jumped 15% -- but that doesn't tell the whole story.\nDuring the Q4 earnings call, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison noted that the company had inked more than 30 AI-centric contracts worth more than $12 billion in the most recent quarter alone. This included some of the largest contracts in Oracle's history. Ellison said he expects robust demand for generative AI to \"turbocharge\" the company's cloud database growth.\nThis, in turn, pushed the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contracts not yet recognized as revenue -- to $98 billion, up 44% year over year. When RPO is growing faster than revenue, this suggests sales growth is accelerating. This helps to illustrate that Oracle is capitalizing on the growing demand for AI among its sizable customer base.\nOracle's long track record of cloud and AI experience has many new and existing enterprise clients jumping on the generative AI bandwagon, looking to benefit from the increased productivity resulting from AI adoption. That said, fortune favors the patient, as this process will take some time to come to fruition.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of $57.9 billion in its fiscal 2025 (which began June 1), giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 7. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Oracle would need to grow its revenue to approximately $148 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nRevenue grew by 11% year over year in the most recent quarter and is expected to accelerate to 15% for the fiscal year. If the company achieves 11% sales growth, Oracle could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2034.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 30, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, Apple Inc. AAPL, Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. has become a new poster boy on the global artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy. The company is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world\u2019s best AI chipset developers.\nTSM provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including processes to manufacture complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others.\nTaiwan Semiconductor reported excellent results for second-quarter 2024 beating both top and bottom lines estimates, supported by a 3-nanometer chipset boom. TSM posted a strong revenue ramp-up across various segments. High-Performance Computing surged by 28%, Digital Consumer Electronics increased by 20%, Internet of Things (IoT) rose 6% and the Automotive sector rose 5%. Only Smartphone-related sales dropped a mere 1%.\nTSM is the largest manufacturer of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s chipsets. NVIDIA is globally the largest developer of generative AI-based chips. TSM also caters to Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Apple Inc., Broadcom Inc. and others.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is experiencing solid demand for its advanced technologies, such as 3-nanometer (nm) and 5nm. The growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum.\nThe company\u2019s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus. Also, strength across its 7nm, 16nm and 28nm technologies are contributing well to its top-line growth. In second-quarter 2024, 3nm, 5nm, 7nm, 16nm and 28nm accounted for 15%, 35%, 17%, 9% and 8% of the company\u2019s wafer revenues, respectively.\nFor third-quarter 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor expects the solid adoption of AI and smartphones to boost the demand for its leading-edge process technologies. It projects revenues between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company also expects more than 20% growth in 2024 revenues due to rising demand for high-end chips used in AI applications.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter and 2024 revenues is pegged at $22.72 billion and $85.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 31.5% and 23%, respectively.\nThe consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.69 per share, suggesting year-over-year growth of 31%. The estimate has been revised upward by 8.3% in the last 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.37 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.9%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.9% in the last seven days.\nTaiwan Semiconductor belongs to the Zacks Defined Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry Industry, which currently stands at the top 1% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Since it is ranked in the top half of Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect the Circuit Foundry industry to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.\nTSM is currently trading at a reasonable valuation compared to its peers. The company has a forward P/E of 25.16x, Price/Sales (P/S) of 10.85x and Price/Book (P/B) of 7.13x. All three parameters are in line with the current industry average.\nTSM\u2019s dominant position in the circuit foundry industry has enabled it to sustain margins. Despite facing inflationary forces, including rising electricity costs, TSM\u2019s gross margin, operating margin, and net margin in the last reported quarter were 53.2%, 42.5%, and 36.8%, respectively.\nTaiwan Semiconductor recorded its all-time high price at $193.47 on Jul 11. After that, the stock price tumbled 16.3% due to an AI-related meltdown. However, the recent dip in stock price is a golden opportunity to enter this stock to enrich your portfolio over the long term.\nThe stock price has soared nearly 57% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 27.7% from the last closing price of $161.94. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$205. Finally, Taiwan Semiconductor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) - Fortescue will reduce about 700 jobs, or 4.5% of its global workforce, in a fresh restructuring round, the Australian miner said on Wednesday, as it appointed acting Chief Financial Officer Apple Paget as its permanent group finance chief.\nThe restructuring underscores a weak outlook for iron ore prices as demand from top consumer China slows further due to its struggling property sector, although recent lacklustre economic data raises hopes for further government stimulus.\nIt is not clear whether the job cuts are specific to the Western Australia region or a particular division such as iron ore or green energy, but the company said the process would be finalised by the end of this month.\nThe miner has in recent times consolidated its metals and energy divisions into One Fortescue, as part of a strategy to \"simplify its structure, remove duplication and deliver cost efficiencies.\"\nMeanwhile, Paget's appointment comes at a time when the world's fourth-largest iron ore miner is facing an exodus of senior management and billionaire owner Andrew Forest attempts to transform the company into a green energy powerhouse.\nPaget, who holds around 25 years of experience as a finance executive, joined Fortescue in January last year.\nChief Corporate Officer Shelley Robertson, who has spent less than a year with the miner, will take on the role of chief operating officer, Fortescue said.\nThe company will report its June-quarter production report on July 25 and its full-year results on Aug. 28.\n(Reporting by Roushni Nair in Bengaluru and Melanie Burton in Sydney; Editing by Janane Venkatraman and Subhranshu Sahu)\n"

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "- A patient with ALS in the United States is the first person in the world to use Apple Vision Pro via an implantable brain computer interface\n- Brain-controlled commands replace the need for hand gestures to enable hands-free and voice-free item selections in people with paralysis\nNEW YORK, July 30, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Synchron, the brain-computer interface (BCI) company, today announced the world\u2019s first-ever use of Apple Vision Pro, by one of the patients implanted with the Synchron brain computer interface.\nMark, a 64-year old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), successfully used his direct thoughts to control the cursor on the Apple Vision Pro when he played Solitaire, watched Apple TV and sent text messages using the Synchron brain computer interface, hands-free. Mark is otherwise unable to use the Apple Vision Pro due to the loss of function of his upper limbs. Apple Vision Pro requires hand gestures to make item selections.\n\"This is pretty cool, I've been wanting to try this for a while now,\" Mark said in reaction to using his BCI to watch a video on the Vision Pro. \"It's like watching it in the theater, it really comes to life. Using this type of enhanced reality is so impactful and I can imagine it would be for others in my position or others who have lost the ability to engage in their day-to-day life. It can transport you to places you never thought you\u2019d see or experience again.\"\nApple Vision Pro is a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others. Vision Pro creates an infinite canvas for apps that scales beyond the boundaries of a traditional display and introduces a fully three-dimensional user interface controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible \u2014 a user\u2019s eyes, hands, and voice.\nSynchron's new BCI integration with Apple Vision Pro, allows for the first time \u2013 users who have lost mobility of their hands and voice to engage with the device. The BCI system is designed to be simple to use and easy to learn. This integration reflects Synchron\u2019s commitment to patient-first innovation in neurotechnology.\n\"BCI is a platform to re-connect people with injury or disease back to the fast-moving consumer technology landscape. Vision Pro is a powerful system, but it relies on the use of hand gestures to exert control over the UI. We are sending control signals directly from the brain to replace the need for hand gestures,\" said Tom Oxley, CEO & Founder, Synchron, \"We are moving towards a new Bluetooth standard for Human Computer Interactions that don\u2019t require touch or speech. This is a critical unmet need for millions of people with paralysis.\"\nThe Synchron BCI is implanted in the blood vessel on the surface of the motor cortex of the brain via the jugular vein, through a minimally-invasive endovascular procedure. Once implanted, it is designed to detect and wirelessly transmit motor intent out of the brain, intended to restore the capability for severely paralyzed people to control personal devices with hands-free point-and-click.\nFor more information about the Synchron BCI and our registry, visit https://synchronbci.com.\nAbout Synchron\nSynchron is a neurotechnology company developing an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) designed to restore functionality in people with severe paralysis.

The company also brokered an unprecedented revenue-sharing agreement with soccer superstar Messi, spurring him to join Inter Miami CF.\nFor the company, it\u2019s an opportunity to lock-in Gen Z males, who are the biggest watchers of MLS games. The league has the youngest audience among all legacy leagues.\nSoccer has become an increasingly strong draw for networks and streaming services. In 2022, the FIFA World Cup final attracted 26 million U.S. viewers on linear TV\u2014more than the NBA Finals (13 million), the World Series (12 million), PGA Finals (10 million), Stanley Cup (5 million), and even the Winter Olympics (12 million).\nApple could be on the verge of doubling down on the sport, as negotiations are reportedly underway with soccer governing body FIFA to carry worldwide television rights for a new tournament.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"
