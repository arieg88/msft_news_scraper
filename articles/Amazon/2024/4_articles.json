        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) reported first quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines, sending shares of the retail giant up around 3% in morning trading Wednesday.\nPowered by a strong showing from its cloud computing segment, Amazon continued a wave of Big Tech results that have mostly wowed Wall Street even as investors turn their focus to the conclusion of the Fed's May policy meeting on Wednesday.\nNet sales rose 13% from the same period last year to $143.3 billion, Amazon reported late Tuesday, topping analyst expectations of $142.6 billion, per Bloomberg data. The beat was driven by a 16% jump in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue, which Amazon said is on course to generate $100 billion annually.\nThe company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 versus consensus estimates of $0.83.\nLike its competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon is wielding its heft in its cloud computing business to gain an edge in the nascent AI market. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to supply vital infrastructure.\nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters following the report that overall capital expenditures are expected to \"meaningfully\" increase this year from nearly $50 billion in 2023, driven by higher infrastructure costs to support growth in AWS.\nAmazon is seeing strong demand on the AWS side, with customers signing up for longer deals with bigger commitments, many with generative AI components, he said.\nAdvertising was another strong contributor to Q1 revenue growth. The company matched analyst expectations of $11.8 billion, up 24% from the same period last year.\nEven as Amazon dazzled with growth across its businesses, its outlook flashed some signs of a potential pullback in consumer spending.\n\"What we are seeing is a bit of a continuation of what we've said in prior quarters. Customers in the US are being very thoughtful about their spend. They look for deals. They trade down,\" Olsavsky said. \"And that trend seems to be continuing into Q2.\"\nAmazon projected Q2 net sales to come in between $144 billion and $149 billion, which is slightly lower than analyst estimates of $150.2 billion, per Bloomberg data.\nAmazon's report arrived a week after its cloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft posted an impressive quarter, beating expectations on the strength of its cloud computing business. The market cheered even louder for Google parent Alphabet's results, which outperformed on the top and bottom lines and came with an announcement of a new dividend, the latest in a trend among tech giants.\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the race to claim market share and launch new consumer services. In March, Amazon increased its investment in the AI startup Anthropic, pouring in another $2.75 billion to bring its investment total to $4 billion.\nAmazon's stock, which joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) in February, is up about 20% for the year.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Brett Schafer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The last few months have been delightful for shareholders of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The stock is up 45% in the last six months and 22% year to date.\nWith a market cap of $1.93 trillion, shares recently surpassed all-time highs set in 2021 as investors become increasingly optimistic about profitability in its e-commerce operations and resurgent growth in cloud computing due to the recent boom in artificial intelligence (AI).\nAmazon stock is now up 100% in the last five years. But what do the next five years look like? Can it repeat this stellar performance and double yet again? Let's take a look.\nEven though the online store is now closing in on 30 years of operations, Amazon's e-commerce and global retail operations are still growing quickly. North American sales increased 12% in 2023 to $353 billion, with international operations growing 11% to $131.2 billion.\nEven though Amazon's platform is so dominant within the e-commerce sector, online shopping makes up only an estimated 15.6% of retail sales in the United States today. If that number can consistently rise over the next 10 to 20 years and Amazon can maintain its market share, there are still many years left to increase sales.\nThe best part about this growth at Amazon's e-commerce division is where it is coming from. Third-party seller services were up by 19% year over year last quarter, and advertising services increased 26%. These high-margin segments can drive overall profit margins higher if they keep growing quickly.\nAnd that is exactly what we are seeing today. North American operating margins hit 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023, expanding for each of the last six quarters and reversing from negative 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2024, investors should expect e-commerce profit margins to continue climbing higher.\nThe most profitable segment at the company is its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In 2023, it generated over $90 billion in sales and $24.6 billion in operating income, giving it a profit margin of 27.1%.\nHowever, back in late 2022 and early 2023, there were major concerns about a slowdown at AWS. Revenue growth fell from 28% in the 2022 third quarter to 12% in the 2023 second quarter as the company helped its software customers save on costs after the height of the pandemic.\nToday, these concerns have proved to be too pessimistic. AWS revenue accelerated in the fourth quarter to 13% growth, which has sent the stock higher. And 2024 and 2025 revenue looks promising with the rapid rise in AI services. These new products use a ton of cloud computing to operate, and AWS is looking to be one of the leaders in this space along with Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. For example, the company has signed an extensive agreement in the space with fast-growing start-up Anthropic.\nOver the next decade and beyond, analysts expect cloud computing to continue its ascent, increasing at a double-digit annual rate. If Amazon can maintain its market share lead as it has in e-commerce, AWS should have many years of growth left ahead.\nTo estimate where the stock will be five years from now, we need to make some profit estimates for both e-commerce and AWS. Let's assume that e-commerce -- excluding the unprofitable international segment -- can grow sales by 12% annually over the next five years and expand profit margins to 10%. That would put 2028 North American retail profits at $62 billion.\nDoing the same for AWS, let's assume five years of 12% growth and profit margins that remain at 27%. In 2028, that would equate to $43 billion in AWS profits. Add both numbers together and you get $105 billion in earnings from Amazon in 2028, and that excludes any upside from other divisions such as international e-commerce or satellite internet services.\nNow comes the hardest part: What earnings multiple will Amazon trade at in 2028? An exact answer is impossible, but with a wide competitive advantage in both cloud computing and e-commerce, I think the stock deserves to trade at an above-market multiple of 30 times earnings, otherwise known as a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E).\nMultiply $105 billion by 30 and you get a market cap of $3.15 trillion, or a 66% boost from today's price. While not a doubling, it looks like Amazon still has upside for shareholders who remain for the long haul.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy is finally going all in on generative AI. In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, the Amazon chief said the technology is the company\u2019s next major product opportunity, up there with Marketplace, Prime, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nJassy also laid out why Amazon is uniquely positioned to thrive in the age of generative AI, explaining how the company has all of the pieces in place to be the go-to tech firm for both enterprise customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 generative AI needs.\n\u201cThe amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all,\u201d Jassy wrote in his letter. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\u201d\nAmazon has kept a relatively low profile when it comes to generative AI compared to the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which have spent the last year boasting about their AI offerings and debuting new generative AI-powered products and services.\nBut Amazon has been investing heavily in the technology, including pouring $4 billion into AI startup Anthropic. This has become a kind of flagship offering for the company, akin to how Microsoft positions its relationship with OpenAI.\nNow, Jassy seems ready to push Amazon as a major generative AI player like its rivals. That includes laying out the company\u2019s approach to the technology, from the chips used to train and run AI models to apps like its Rufus chatbot for Amazon\u2019s Marketplace and Amazon Q, which writes and debugs code for AWS users.\nIn his letter, Jassy touted Amazon\u2019s investments in its Graviton CPU chips, as well as its Trainium chip for training AI models and Inferentia chip for inferencing those models, as key offerings that set Amazon apart from the competition. Inferencing refers to using AI models to complete tasks.\nAnd while Jassy said that Amazon offers a vast array of Nvidia (NVDA) chips to its customers for training and deploying AI models, he positioned Amazon\u2019s chips as viable alternatives that can meet customers\u2019 needs at a time when Nvidia\u2019s chips are in short supply and the price to run AI models soars.\nJassy also appeared to take a shot at his Big Tech rivals' AI models themselves, saying that Amazon offers models from a slew of companies, including Anthropic, Stability AI, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, and Amazon\u2019s own models, rather than just one major AI model.\n\u201cCustomers don\u2019t want only one model,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cThey want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications.\u201d\nWhile Microsoft and Google offer multiple AI models to their enterprise customers, the companies have spent much of their time hyping their respective AI platforms. Microsoft regularly points to its relationship with ChatGPT developer OpenAI as a major factor that differentiates it from other Big Tech firms, while Google is focused on rolling out and hyping its Gemini foundation models.\nJassy also pointed to Amazon\u2019s efforts to build its own generative AI apps, including its Amazon Q platform for AWS developers and Rufus chatbot. I used an early version of Rufus, and while I found it helpful in some respects, it\u2019s also still prone to errors when answering some queries.\nNow that Amazon is going full force into the generative AI realm, it will be interesting to see how Microsoft and Google respond. We\u2019ll find out more when both companies host their respective developer conferences next month.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "How Amazon Became the Largest Private EV Charging Operator in the US",
        "Author": "  Matt Day ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon\u2019s Maple Valley, Washington, warehouse is built for speed. At night, big rigs pull up to one end to unload boxes and padded mailers \u2013 some after a short drive from a bigger warehouse down the road, others following a flight in the hold of a cargo plane. Waiting employees scan, sort and load them into rolling racks.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City\nElon Wants His Money Back\nSingapore Loses \u2018World\u2019s Best Airport\u2019 Crown to Qatar\nRecord Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud Seeding\nRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs\nBefore 7 a.m. each day, many of those racks are wheeled out to dozens of vans lined up in four painted lanes. It\u2019s the starting line at a Formula One race, but for $22-an-hour delivery drivers who ferry bottles of shampoo and packs of batteries to suburban Seattle doorsteps.\nTheir routes, the last step in a journey that can take products thousands of miles, are the source of a large chunk of the carbon emissions Amazon has pledged to eliminate in the coming decades.\nThe solution lies in the parking lot across the street: 309 Siemens electric vehicle chargers, which power delivery vans built by Rivian Automotive Inc. Making deliveries without tailpipe emissions, and increasing the size of the electric fleet, is among the most straightforward ways Amazon can wipe carbon from its operations.\nIn a little more than two years, Amazon has installed more than 17,000 chargers at about 120 warehouses around the US, making the retail giant the largest operator of private electrical vehicle charging infrastructure in the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve figured out the path,\u201d said Tom Chempananical, who oversees Amazon\u2019s fleet of last-mile delivery vehicles.\nLogistics companies like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. have rolled out their own ambitious electric vehicle targets, though many have failed to meaningfully curb the growing emissions from e-commerce deliveries. Amazon, meanwhile, backed away from a vow to make half of all deliveries with zero carbon pollution by 2030, saying that initiative was superseded by broader climate goals. But the company has come farther and faster in the transition to EVs than most of its competitors. Understanding the challenges faced by Amazon, a company known for going to extreme lengths to meet tight delivery deadlines, can help chart a roadmap for other companies across industries trying to eliminate their own carbon bills.\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s scale matters,\u201d said Kellen Schefter, director of transportation at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities that has worked to connect Amazon to power companies. \u201cIf Amazon can show that it meets their climate goals while also meeting their package-delivery goals, we can show this all actually works.\u201d\nAmazon has a long way to go. The Seattle-based company says its operations emitted about 71 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, up by almost 40% since Jeff Bezos\u2019s 2019 vow that his company would eventually stop contributing to the emissions warming the planet. Many of Amazon\u2019s emissions come from activities \u2013 air freight, ocean shipping, construction, and electronics manufacturing, to name a few \u2013 that lack a clear, carbon-free alternative, today or any time soon. The company has not made much progress on decarbonization of long-haul trucking, whose emissions tend to be concentrated in industrial and outlying areas rather than the big cities that served as the backdrop for Amazon\u2019s electric delivery vehicle rollout.\nBut Amazon is on track to purchase by next year as much electricity produced by solar, wind and other carbon-free sources as it uses to power its operations. And in Rivian, which Amazon has backed with a massive investment and an order for 100,000 custom-built delivery vans \u2013 13,500 of which have been delivered to date \u2013 the company has suggested it can eliminate much of the emissions associated with its last-mile delivery business.\nTo get there, Amazon had to learn how to pick up the phone and call the power company. Electric utilities, which to that point primarily dealt with electric vehicles through powering the odd home car charging setup, encountered a new type of customer in Amazon. Government electricity use estimates show a 100,000-square-foot warehouse tucked in an industrial area might be powered by about 50 kilowatts, mainly for lighting and air circulation. Setting up 100 chargers in the parking lot could require 10 to 20 times as much power.\n\u201cWhat was different here was this was a new type of electric use,\u201d said Schefter, of the EEI. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big power requirement in a parking lot.\u201d That need could be met relatively quickly if the transmission lines in the area have spare capacity. In areas of the grid that don\u2019t, upgrades can take years.\nRead More: 11 Startups Leading the $1.8 Trillion Climate Tech Revolution\nAmazon also learned how to be flexible and how to wait. The company prefers cookie-cutter processes that can be run like a production line. That breaks down in the physical world, where Amazon\u2019s hundreds of last-mile delivery warehouses come in different designs or parking lot layouts, subject to differing local utility protocols.\n\u201cIt was a bit of a surprise, how long we would need to prepare for the lead time for infrastructure,\u201d said Chris Atkins, who leads Amazon\u2019s logistics sustainability teams.\nIn 2020, Amazon met with some of the country\u2019s large utilities, who probed the company on how much power it would need and where. Representatives of Commonwealth Edison, Illinois\u2019s largest power provider, were there. The utility, which was struggling to secure some types of new equipment during the pandemic, opted to repurpose old transformers for Amazon. \u201cWe were doing some pretty creative stuff internally to make sure that we had what they needed and that we could meet the timelines that they wanted,\u201d said Diana Sharpe, who deals with large customers at the Exelon Corp.-owned company.\nBy the time Rivian began rolling out large quantities of vans during the spring of 2022, ComEd had routed additional power to an Amazon warehouse in Chicago\u2019s Pullman neighborhood. Rivian\u2019s CEO stopped by that July for a ribbon cutting to announce the vans were hitting the road. Today, ComEd powers about 1,100 chargers at four Amazon warehouses in greater Chicago.\nAnother lesson Amazon learned is one the company isn\u2019t keen to talk about: going green can be expensive, at least initially. Based on the type of chargers Amazon deploys \u2013 almost entirely mid-tier chargers called Level 2 in the industry \u2013 the hardware likely cost between $50 million and $90 million, according to Bloomberg estimates based on cost estimates supplied by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Factoring in costs beyond the plugs and related hardware -- like digging through a parking lot to lay wires or set up electrical panels and cabinets \u2013 could double that sum. Amazon declined to comment on how much it spent on its EV charging push.\nIn addition to the expense of the chargers, electric vehicle fleet operators are typically on the hook for utility upgrades. When companies request the sort of increases to electrical capacity that Amazon has \u2013 the Maple Valley warehouse has three megawatts of power for its chargers \u2013 they tend to pay for them, making the utility whole for work done on behalf of a single customer. Amazon says it pays upgrade costs as determined by utilities, but that in some locations the upgrades fit within the standard service power companies will handle out of their own pocket.\nWhen Amazon made the Rivian order, people who worked on the program expected that running an electric delivery fleet would eventually be cheaper than the company\u2019s conventionally fueled fleet, a hodgepodge of bulk-ordered gasoline and diesel vehicles built by the likes of Ford Motor Co., Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Stellantis NV. It\u2019s unclear if Amazon is there yet, though Chempananical said Amazon was happy with the price tag of the Rivian vehicles. \u201cAll of those costs continue to scale down,\u201d he said. \u201cAs usage grows, there's more demand, there's more supply, it gets more efficient and continues to drive to a better spot.\u201d\nAmazon also had to figure out the logistics of charger sharing. That\u2019s not an issue at the Maple Valley warehouse, where 77 electric vans have their pick from among a fleet of 307 level 2 chargers. But other sites have fewer chargers than available vans. Fully charging a van can take several hours, and at first, that created some headaches. Amazon initially required the subcontractors who manage van fleets and drivers to keep their own staff working overnight to rotate vans among available chargers. Last fall Amazon brought that work in house, freeing subcontracted workers to drive, rather than babysit chargers. \u201cThey need the drivers, at the end of the day,\u201d Chempananical said.\nAmazon\u2019s contract drivers say they love the vans, which were built for the company\u2019s sometimes punishing, package-every-90-seconds routes and frequent stops. The people who employ the drivers \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Delivery Service Partners \u2013 have some complaints. Two West Coast delivery service providers, who asked for anonymity to protect their relationship with Amazon, said body work can cost two or three times as much as conventional vehicles, because few body shops are authorized to work on Rivian vans. Spare parts can be hard to come by.\nTrucking presents a bigger challenge, for Amazon and the industry. Automakers are much farther along in electrifying cars and light-duty trucks than the tractors that haul shipping containers from ports and between warehouses (see Tesla\u2019s semi truck, which is still in pilot production years after being unveiled). Bug-eyed Rivian electric vans are a common sight crisscrossing major cities like Seattle, Los Angeles, New York and their suburbs. But the communities that host the massive warehouses further up the supply chain, often poorer precincts in places like northeast Pennsylvania or California\u2019s Inland Empire, have yet to see the same benefits of electrification. In the company\u2019s post-pandemic cost cutting drives, Amazon has delayed and shelved some trucking-related and other so-called \u201cmiddle mile\u201d sustainability investments, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nAtkins rejected the critique, rattling off moves Amazon has made in the arena: buying trucks that run on compressed natural gas, and investing in makers of green hydrogen, among other fuel sources. \u201cIt's important that we get it right and not just scale with the wrong partners,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt will get there,\u201d Chempananical said of Amazon\u2019s investments in the \u201cmiddle mile.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when and how we get there.\u201d\nBack at the Maple Valley warehouse, Justin Shearer, who runs Pacific Delivery and Logistics, an Amazon delivery service provider, gives a tour of his corner of the facility. Like many of Amazon\u2019s small army of delivery contractors, he holds another job. Shearer is a commercial fisherman, and earlier in his career he sold mining and logging equipment. He doesn\u2019t consider himself an environmentalist. But the benefits of keeping oil products off the road are obvious, he said.\n\u201cPutting this infrastructure in is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not been done at this scale, but you're not going to get better at it unless you start somewhere.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store\nFor Multinationals, Africa\u2019s Allure Is Fading\nRents Are the Fed\u2019s \u2018Biggest Stumbling Block\u2019 in Taming US Inflation\nThe AI Chatbot That Could Transform Business School Accreditation\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Lewis Krauskopf ",
        "Text": "By Lewis Krauskopf\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders.\nGoogle parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor.\nThat has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade.\nAmazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies.\n\u201cIt certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they\u2019re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research.\n\u201cDividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,\u201d Colas said.\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence.\n\"They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'\" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon.\nWhile corporate profits are ultimately seen as a far more important driver of a company\u2019s share price, dividends could increase a stock\u2019s shareholder base - though they may take time to do so.\nAbout $1 trillion was invested in dividend funds as of September, according to Morningstar. However, megacaps such as Meta and Alphabet may be off-limits to many of them, for now.\nMany funds look for stocks that have dividend yields far higher than those offered by dividend-paying members of the Magnificent Seven, said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar Research Services. A yield is the dividend paid per share as a percentage of the current share price.\nMeta shares, for example, currently yield 0.45% while Alphabet yields 0.47%. That is below the 1.44% yield of the overall S&P 500, and well below the yields of stocks such as Pfizer and 3M, which are both over 6%, according to LSEG data.\nAmong other Magnificent Seven members, Microsoft yields 0.74%, Apple yields 0.57% and Nvidia, whose shares are up 77% so far this year, yields a paltry 0.02%.\nOther funds focus on companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time, and companies such as Meta and Alphabet lack such track records as new initiators.\nApple, however, was last year added to the popular Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, Sotiroff said. The exchange-traded fund owned some $3.45 billion of the company\u2019s shares as of the end of March, its second-biggest holding.\nOn the other hand, actively managed funds not bound by such restrictions could more immediately hop on board the shares of a company that just announced a dividend, Sotiroff said.\nOr, \"it might be individual investors that like it now because it is making a payout,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New YorkEditing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc. is rapidly advancing its use of robotics, deploying over 750,000 robots to work alongside its employees.\nThe world's second-largest private employer employs 1.5 million people. While that's a lot, it's a decrease of over 100,000 employees from the 1.6 million workers it had in 2021. Meanwhile, the company had 520,000 robots in 2022 and 200,000 robots in 2019. While Amazon is bringing on hundreds of thousands of robots per year, the company is slowly decreasing its employee numbers.\nThe robots, including new models like Sequoia and Digit, are designed to perform repetitive tasks, thereby improving efficiency, safety and delivery speed for Amazon\u2018s customers. Sequoia, for example, speeds up inventory management and order processing in fulfillment centers, while Digit, a bipedal robot developed in collaboration with Agility Robotics, handles tasks like moving empty tote boxes.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share.\nInvest like a millionaire.

Despite the massive scale of automation, Amazon emphasizes that deploying robots has led to the creation of new skilled job categories at the company, reflecting a broader industry trend toward the integration of advanced technologies with human workforces.\nAmazon's deployment of over 750,000 robots represents a significant move toward automation at the world's second-largest employer. The shift has the potential to significantly impact job dynamics within the company and beyond. While Amazon asserts that robots are meant to work collaboratively with human employees, assisting them with repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and workplace safety, concerns about job displacement and the implications for the workforce are inevitable.\nAmazon\u2019s integration of robots like Sequoia and Digit into its fulfillment centers is part of its broader strategy to enhance its supply chain operations through advanced technologies. The robots are designed to streamline operations and ensure faster delivery times to customers. The company emphasizes that robotic solutions support workplace safety and allow it to offer a wider range of products for same-day or next-day delivery.\nTrending: Invest alongside exec\u2019s from Uber, Facebook and Apple in this wellness app Transforming a $5.6 TRILLION dollar industry.\nThe introduction of such a large number of robots into the workforce raises questions about the future role of human labor in Amazon\u2019s operational model. The impact on jobs, particularly tasks that are highly repetitive and could be easily automated, is a concern for many. Research from institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has shown that industrial robots have a significant negative impact on workers, affecting jobs and wages in the areas where they are deployed. The broader discussion on the economic and political consequences of automation highlights widespread fears of job displacement and the potential for increased income inequality.\nDespite these concerns, Amazon has pointed out the creation of 700 categories of skilled job types that previously didn't exist at the company, suggesting that automation can also lead to the creation of new types of employment opportunities. This evolution within Amazon\u2019s workforce could reflect a shift in the nature of work where human employees move toward more complex, nonrepetitive tasks that require higher levels of skill and creativity.\nAmazon could serve as a microcosm for broader trends in the economy, where the integration of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and the labor market. The challenge for Amazon, and society at large, will be to navigate these changes in ways that maximize the benefits of automation while mitigating negative impacts on employment and ensuring that the gains from increased productivity are shared broadly across the workforce.\nRead About Startup Investing:\nThis \u2018Future of Gaming\u2019 startup disrupting a $272 billion industry is now letting anyone invest for a limited time.\nThis Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here\u2019s how anyone can invest for a limited time.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Amazon Grows To Over 750,000 Robots As World's Second-Largest Private Employer Replaces Over 100,000 Humans originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders have enjoyed a 83% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 66% (not including dividends).\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Amazon.com moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd hope to see the share price to rise.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nIt's good to see that Amazon.com has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 70% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Before spending more time on Amazon.com it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "Amazon has engineered significant cost cuts across its delivery network over the past year, but CEO Andy Jassy still believes there\u2019s more to come.\n\u201cAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we\u2019re not done lowering our cost to serve,\u201d said Jassy in his annual letter to shareholders. \u201cWe\u2019ve challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there\u2019s more upside for us.\u201d\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nAmazon, Walmart Called Out for 'Excessive' Warehouse Surveillance\nAmazon Launches Low-Price Marketplace in India\nRetail Tech: Blue Yonder's $839M Acquisition, CommentSold Launches PopClips\nAmazon\u2019s cost cutting began in early 2023 when the company restructured its U.S. fulfillment network into eight self-sufficient regional networks, so that product could travel shorter distances to the end consumer.\nThis has helped the e-commerce giant ultimately lower its \u201ccost to serve\u201d\u2014which is the cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer\u2014by more than 45 cents per unit in the U.S. compared to a year ago.\n\u201cDecreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest in speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cMore selection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\u201d\nJassy attributes Amazon\u2019s wider success to its focus on creating what he called \u201cprimitive services,\u201d which are foundational building blocks like Amazon Web Services (AWS) that facilitate innovation for the company.\nOne such primitive Jassy identified was the company\u2019s 58 same-day fulfillment facilities, which have helped the tech titan increase the number of items delivered either same-day or overnight by more than 65 percent year over year in Q4.\n\u201cThey\u2019re located in the largest metro areas around the U.S., house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millions of other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities) and streamline the time required to go from picking a customer\u2019s order to being ready to ship to as little as 11 minutes,\u201d said Jassy. \u201cThese facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so positive for customers that we\u2019re planning to double the number of these facilities.\u201d\nBut Jassy believes the same-day facilities have a lot more potential to improve areas like Amazon\u2019s seemingly experimental grocery business, particularly for delivering organic products from Whole Foods Market or non-perishable goods such as canned goods and health and beauty products.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard on building a mass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if we used our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs or other perishable items to any Amazon order and get same day?\u201d Jassy questioned. \u201cIt might change how people think of splitting up their weekly grocery shopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\u201d\nJassy also acknowledged the recent hiccups seen in expanding its drone capabilities, with the company\u2019s Prime Air drone division seeing setbacks due to government regulations, layoffs and top team members leaving the unit.\nBut he doesn\u2019t appear to be backing off the commitment for the long run. Upon saying the drones were \u201cmaking substantial progress,\u201d Jassy said the service would be \u201ca very valuable future primitive capability\u201d for Amazon.\n\u201cDrones will eventually allow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won\u2019t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it\u2019ll be pervasive over time,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cThink about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\u201d\nThe CEO also talked up Amazon\u2019s robotics team, which has introduced new tests in recent months that have further cut metrics like inventory identification time or order processing time across multiple warehouses.\nSuch investments cost a pretty penny for Amazon. On the same day Jassy published his shareholder letter, the company announced it will have spent 700 million euros ($744 million) on robotics deployments in Europe alone over the past five years by the end of 2024.\nIn that time, Amazon deployed more than 1,000 robotics systems across its European fulfillment center network. The company expects to introduce 120 new pieces of automation technologies in 2024.\n\u201cSome of the biggest opportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobility of large cages across long distances and automatic identification of items,\u201d said Jassy in his letter. \u201cOur robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will be lynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading, large pallet mobility and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles).\u201d\nJassy also lauded the robotics team is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments, optimize the movement of its robotic fleet and better manage the bottlenecks in its facilities.\n"

Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.65%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.79%.\nThe online retailer's stock has climbed by 6.71% in the past month, exceeding the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.91% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.85%.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Amazon in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.81, indicating a 161.29% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $142.48 billion, up 11.88% from the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.08 per share and revenue of $641.45 billion, which would represent changes of +40.69% and +11.6%, respectively, from the prior year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Amazon. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance.

        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "A year of weak parcel demand didn\u2019t stop Amazon\u2019s logistics network from gobbling up more market share.\nThe e-commerce giant\u2019s carrier business surpassed UPS parcel volume for the first time in 2023, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index, which measures parcel volume and spend for shipments that weigh up to 70 pounds.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nHypebeast Is Selling Luxury Pre-Owned Streetwear on\u00a0Amazon\n'You've Got Weeks, Not Months, to Fix This': Senate Grills DeJoy on USPS Delays\nAmazon Has Used AI to Avoid 2 Million Tons of Excess Packaging\nTotal U.S. parcel volume was up 0.5 percent from 21.5 billion in 2022 to 21.7 billion in 2023, with revenue declining 0.3 percent to $197.9 billion\u2014the first parcel sales decline in seven years.\nAfter seeing total volume increase 15.7 percent to 5.9 billion parcels, Amazon now has the second-largest market share in parcel delivery at 27 percent of volume, the index said. The tech titan commanded 23 percent of market share last year, less than the 24 percent held at UPS.\nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) generated the highest parcel volume, but the 6.6 billion packages were still down almost 1 percent from last year, taking 31 percent of market share, the index said.\nThroughout 2023, volume for both UPS and FedEx as calculated by Pitney Bowes dipped 10.3 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively. UPS now has a 21 percent market share with 4.6 billion parcels, while FedEx has an 18 percent share at 3.9 billion packages.\n\u201cAmazon leapfrogging USPS [in volume] wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but I think the more important question comes down to revenue (and ultimately profits),\u201d said Jason Miller, interim chairperson, department of supply chain management at Michigan State University\u2019s Eli Broad College of Business. \u201cUPS and FedEx are focusing on yield more so than market share growth (which is reflected in the much higher average price point they are charging).\u201d\nAccording to the Pitney Bowes index, UPS and FedEx remain the top players in revenue despite Amazon\u2019s focus on gaining volume. While Amazon Logistics is calculated to have taken 14 percent of market share by revenue in 2023, it still has a long way to go to reach the levels of UPS (35 percent) and FedEx (32 percent).\nThe good news for brands and retailers is that they have access to accelerating capacity levels throughout logistics, regardless of option, according to Satish Jindel, president at SJ Consulting Group.\n\u201cShippers need to know that the parcel market is in a state it has never been in the last 40 years,\u201d said Jindel, who is a founding member of Roadway Package System, which FedEx acquired and rebranded into FedEx Ground in 2000. \u201cTotal parcel capacity is at 125 million packages a day, and the demand is at 80 million. What does that do? It means the shippers have greater influence on managing their pricing.\u201d\nJindel cited data from USPS, which indicates that the agency\u2019s package processing capacity reached 70 million prior to the 2023 holiday season. He noted that the courier more than doubled its capacity since 2020 amid prior concerns ahead of that year\u2019s presidential election, when more consumers mailed in ballots due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe four largest carriers shared more of the market with smaller competitors in 2023, as \u201cother\u201d carriers saw their combined volumes grow 28.5 percent to roughly 640 million parcels. Revenue among these companies grew 32.5 percent to $5.6 billion in 2023.\n\u201cMy sense is that, consistent with most markets where there is secular growth, an expanding market allows for more competitors to enter who will target niche customers,\u201d Miller told Sourcing Journal. \u201cThis tends to hold in most industries where there are a small number of massive generalist firms and then a secondary set of smaller players serving more specific market needs.\u201d\nJindel had a contrasting opinion on the addition of new last-mile delivery players.\n\u201cWhen the market is saturated with capacity, it\u2019s not a good time to enter the business,\u201d he said.\nCurrently, Jindel said Amazon should have the inside track to gain more traction in logistics since they already have a B2C business model that complements their ability to pick up and deliver goods from other third-party businesses.\n\u201cThey can do it very effectively as an operation, but they are struggling with the technology side of it,\u201d Jindel said. \u201cThose other shippers rely on third parties to do a lot of technical and IT work to enable them to ship and bill and manage service for the customer. Amazon is struggling to understand that and enable that.\u201d\nPitney Bowes forecasts that overall U.S. parcel volume will reach between 23 billion and 35 billion by 2029, with the company listing the \u201cmost likely scenario\u201d at 29 billion packages, boosted by a 5 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2024 and 2029.\nAt least through 2024, Jindel doesn\u2019t expect much of an uptick in parcel demand outside of the normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to make the demand pick up?\u201d Jindel asked. \u201cPeople have had too many costs, and aren\u2019t sitting one a lot of excess cash to spend. And what they have, they\u2019re spending it on services and entertainment.\u201d\n"

        "Text": "Ah, Amazon. The one-stop shop for basically everything has made adding items to your cart as easy as one quick click. But what happens when, for a variety of reasons, you want to break up with the online behemoth?\nGOBankingRates talked with two former frequent Amazon shoppers about their experiences quitting the retail giant. Despite Amazon\u2019s popularity for convenience and fast shipping, these shoppers ultimately decided to stop buying from the company altogether.\nRead Next: Frugal People Love the 6 to 1 Grocery Shopping Method: Here\u2019s Why It WorksCheck Out: How To Get $340 Per Year in Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You Already Buy\nMaking such a drastic change wasn\u2019t easy at first. But in the long run, both shoppers found themselves saving money, supporting small businesses and being more mindful of their spending habits after kicking the Amazon habit.\nHere\u2019s why they stopped buying things from Amazon and what they learned along the way.\nSponsored: Credit card debt keeping you up at night? Find out if you can reduce your debt with these 3 steps\nFor many loyal Amazon customers, the sheer convenience is hard to pass up. Eloisa Hife described how difficult it was to initially give up being able to order anything she wanted with just a few clicks. Like Hife, most people get very accustomed to relying on Amazon for quick, cheap access to practically any item.\nJasmine Charbonier also emphasized the challenge of going cold turkey from Amazon Prime\u2019s quick shipping in particular. She had to retrain herself to plan shopping trips instead of instantly clicking to buy items online.\nAccording to Charbonier, it takes dedication to \u201crethink where I could buy basics like household items and books\u201d without Amazon\u2019s instant gratification. But she has found that the adjustment ultimately taught her that sometimes things you want in life are worth working a little harder for.\nBe Aware: 10 Washing Machines That Aren\u2019t Worth the Money\nFor Charbonier, one of the biggest perks of dropping Amazon was it forced her to curb impulse spending habits. She shared that the convenience of Amazon\u2019s 1-click buy option made it far too easy to purchase things without considering if she really needed them.\n\u201cMy Amazon addiction was out of control \u2014 I was browsing and buying something almost daily without thinking,\u201d she said.\nRemoving that friction made her evaluate each potential purchase more critically before buying. Asking herself whether she would actually use an item enough to justify the cost helped avoid many unneeded impulse buys.\nHife also highlighted that she is now \u201cmore mindful of my needs and wants\u201d when it comes to spending money. Kicking the Amazon habit can help many people save by changing their impulse shopping behaviors for the better.\nRather than feeding more dollars into Amazon\u2019s nearly trillion dollar valuation, both shoppers realized they could redirect their spending to support small and local businesses instead.\nHife shared that leaving Amazon made her \u201cmore aware of the company\u2019s negative impact on small businesses.\u201d She now actively chooses to buy from local shops and ethical brands when possible.\nCharbonier also emphasized that discovering alternatives to Amazon led her to explore small businesses in her own Tampa neighborhood. She felt good being able to invest in those stores directly.\n\u201cShopping locally created friendships and a sense of community,\u201d she said.\nFor Charbonier, packages always arrived from Amazon so conveniently that she didn\u2019t cherish the items she bought very much. But with Amazon out of the picture, she explained, she valued the items that she brought into her home more.\nHife also highlighted that she became more quality and budget-conscious after quitting Amazon. With less stuff entering her home, she gained a renewed sense of ownership over her possessions. Simply put, she\u2019s happier with less, and she has quitting Amazon to thank for that.\nAbove all, Charbonier said the biggest lesson after quitting Amazon was learning \u201cto spend more intentionally\u201d overall. Both she and Hife believe the convenient checkout process had enabled mindless spending without properly evaluating each purchase.\nGone are the day of impulse purchases \u2014 now both women are more thoughtful about what they surround themselves with.\u00a0Removing that easy outlet required Charbonier to value every dollar spent elsewhere more. She also gained greater satisfaction from the thoughtful purchases she did decide to make.\nBoth Charbonier and Hife show how breaking up with Amazon can lead people to be more conscious spenders in all aspects of life. Does that mean that everyone should break up with Amazon?\nWell, for some people it\u2019s more difficult (or downright impossible!), but these examples show that even if you don\u2019t quit cold turkey, you can make changes to be more conscientious of how you purchase from the delivery company.\n\u201cMaking the switch really did take some time and effort on my end, but I\u2019m really glad to have done so,\u201d said Hife.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Expensive Costco Items That Are Definitely Worth the Cost\nI Was Retired, but Wasted Big Money On These 3 Things and Had To Go Back To Work\n5 Reasons You Should Consider an Annuity For Your Retirement Savings\n10 New Cars to Avoid Buying in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I Stopped Buying Things From Amazon \u2014 Here\u2019s What I Learned\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is on a roll. Up 75% over the last 52 weeks -- 3x the performance of the S&P 500 -- Amazon looks almost entirely recovered from its pandemic-related funk.\nAmazon lost $2.7 billion in 2022, as the costs of expanding to accommodate pandemic-era home shopping came home to roost. But 2023 profits -- $30.4 billion -- nearly equaled the company's record profit of 2021 ($33.4 billion). And this year, Amazon looks ready to set a new record, with analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence predicting the e-commerce star will earn more than $44 billion.\nThink that's worth an upgrade? So does Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali. On Wednesday, he raised his price target on Amazon stock by 11%, to $216 a share. That target implies 19% upside for the tech stock over the next 12 months.\nCiting proprietary \"Truist Card Data\" that tracks consumer spending, Squali says Amazon's sales are up, its advertising business is booming, and \"further growth acceleration at AWS\" means Amazon will beat earnings when it reports first-quarter results later this month. That already sounds pretty good, with retail (Amazon's biggest business by revenue) and Amazon Web Services (its biggest profits producer) both thriving -- and some high-margin advertising money adding heft to the quarter. But this story is even bigger than that.\nAs Amazon takes tight rein on expenses, the company's posting improved operating profit margins (6.4% in 2023 -- twice 2022's tally), generating more net income. Squali expects these margins and profits to continue to improve \"over the next several years.\" And he's not alone. By 2028, S&P data show, analysts agree Amazon could grow its earnings as high as $100 billion per year, a compound annual growth rate of 22%.\nNow, inquiring minds can differ on whether even 22% growth is enough to justify Amazon's stock price -- currently 63 times trailing earnings. But so long as earnings keep growing, there's no reason to think that this already expensive stock can't reach Squali's target price.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Amazon Surpasses UPS in Parcel Volume For First Time, Index Says",
        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "A year of weak parcel demand didn\u2019t stop Amazon\u2019s logistics network from gobbling up more market share.\nThe e-commerce giant\u2019s carrier business surpassed UPS parcel volume for the first time in 2023, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index, which measures parcel volume and spend for shipments that weigh up to 70 pounds.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nHypebeast Is Selling Luxury Pre-Owned Streetwear on\u00a0Amazon\n'You've Got Weeks, Not Months, to Fix This': Senate Grills DeJoy on USPS Delays\nAmazon Has Used AI to Avoid 2 Million Tons of Excess Packaging\nTotal U.S. parcel volume was up 0.5 percent from 21.5 billion in 2022 to 21.7 billion in 2023, with revenue declining 0.3 percent to $197.9 billion\u2014the first parcel sales decline in seven years.\nAfter seeing total volume increase 15.7 percent to 5.9 billion parcels, Amazon now has the second-largest market share in parcel delivery at 27 percent of volume, the index said. The tech titan commanded 23 percent of market share last year, less than the 24 percent held at UPS.\nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) generated the highest parcel volume, but the 6.6 billion packages were still down almost 1 percent from last year, taking 31 percent of market share, the index said.\nThroughout 2023, volume for both UPS and FedEx as calculated by Pitney Bowes dipped 10.3 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively. UPS now has a 21 percent market share with 4.6 billion parcels, while FedEx has an 18 percent share at 3.9 billion packages.\n\u201cAmazon leapfrogging USPS [in volume] wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but I think the more important question comes down to revenue (and ultimately profits),\u201d said Jason Miller, interim chairperson, department of supply chain management at Michigan State University\u2019s Eli Broad College of Business. \u201cUPS and FedEx are focusing on yield more so than market share growth (which is reflected in the much higher average price point they are charging).\u201d\nAccording to the Pitney Bowes index, UPS and FedEx remain the top players in revenue despite Amazon\u2019s focus on gaining volume. While Amazon Logistics is calculated to have taken 14 percent of market share by revenue in 2023, it still has a long way to go to reach the levels of UPS (35 percent) and FedEx (32 percent).\nThe good news for brands and retailers is that they have access to accelerating capacity levels throughout logistics, regardless of option, according to Satish Jindel, president at SJ Consulting Group.\n\u201cShippers need to know that the parcel market is in a state it has never been in the last 40 years,\u201d said Jindel, who is a founding member of Roadway Package System, which FedEx acquired and rebranded into FedEx Ground in 2000. \u201cTotal parcel capacity is at 125 million packages a day, and the demand is at 80 million. What does that do? It means the shippers have greater influence on managing their pricing.\u201d\nJindel cited data from USPS, which indicates that the agency\u2019s package processing capacity reached 70 million prior to the 2023 holiday season. He noted that the courier more than doubled its capacity since 2020 amid prior concerns ahead of that year\u2019s presidential election, when more consumers mailed in ballots due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe four largest carriers shared more of the market with smaller competitors in 2023, as \u201cother\u201d carriers saw their combined volumes grow 28.5 percent to roughly 640 million parcels. Revenue among these companies grew 32.5 percent to $5.6 billion in 2023.\n\u201cMy sense is that, consistent with most markets where there is secular growth, an expanding market allows for more competitors to enter who will target niche customers,\u201d Miller told Sourcing Journal. \u201cThis tends to hold in most industries where there are a small number of massive generalist firms and then a secondary set of smaller players serving more specific market needs.\u201d\nJindel had a contrasting opinion on the addition of new last-mile delivery players.\n\u201cWhen the market is saturated with capacity, it\u2019s not a good time to enter the business,\u201d he said.\nCurrently, Jindel said Amazon should have the inside track to gain more traction in logistics since they already have a B2C business model that complements their ability to pick up and deliver goods from other third-party businesses.\n\u201cThey can do it very effectively as an operation, but they are struggling with the technology side of it,\u201d Jindel said. \u201cThose other shippers rely on third parties to do a lot of technical and IT work to enable them to ship and bill and manage service for the customer. Amazon is struggling to understand that and enable that.\u201d\nPitney Bowes forecasts that overall U.S. parcel volume will reach between 23 billion and 35 billion by 2029, with the company listing the \u201cmost likely scenario\u201d at 29 billion packages, boosted by a 5 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2024 and 2029.\nAt least through 2024, Jindel doesn\u2019t expect much of an uptick in parcel demand outside of the normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to make the demand pick up?\u201d Jindel asked. \u201cPeople have had too many costs, and aren\u2019t sitting one a lot of excess cash to spend. And what they have, they\u2019re spending it on services and entertainment.\u201d\n"

        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "Seattle-based Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, with a market capitalization of more than $1.8 trillion, is one of the most valuable companies worldwide. Amazon is the frontrunner in the e-commerce and cloud computing space. Jeff Bezos\u2019 company has also ventured into AI to propel its growth and boasts a prospering advertising business.\nAMZN shares at first pulled back during the 2020 bear market, but since then, it has gained traction as consumers prefer shopping online. Amazon\u2019s shares scaled upward by 19.1% in the first three months of 2024, exceeding the Internet-Commerce industry\u2019s gain of 10.2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon extended its winning streak and hit an all-time closing high of 189.05 on Apr 11. However, its shares are now trading in a narrow range and have notched gains in two of the last 10 trading sessions since then. So, is there more upside left for this e-commerce behemoth? The consensus among market pundits is that Amazon\u2019s stock will keep gaining in the near term, banking on solid first-quarter earnings results, slated to be released on Apr 30, after market close.\nAmazon is projected to report earnings per share of 81 cents in the first quarter of 2024, more than 31 cents a year ago, indicating a jump of 161.3%. Amazon is also estimated to register an 11.9% year-over-year revenue increase, to $142.5 billion.\nIn reality, Amazon has already delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 51%, on average, which strengthened investors\u2019 expectations of another round of solid profits and revenues. Moreover, Amazon has an Earnings ESP of +7.51%, a tell-tale sign that the company is well-poised to beat in the forthcoming earnings announcement. Needless to say, an improvement in earnings should jack up the share price.\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nSustained growth in the advertisement business acts as a boon for Amazon. The company\u2019s advertising revenues soared 24% year over year to $47 billion in 2023. And with the company rolling out video ads in its Prime service in January, ad-related revenues will surely get a boost in the first quarter.\nWhat\u2019s more, in a recent survey conducted by Wedbush Securities, almost 56% of respondents said that they increased their ad spending on Amazon by nearly 10% year over year in the first quarter and intend to further increase their budget for Amazon ads by the end of 2024.\nRevenues from advertising are widely expected to post a healthy 23% growth by the end of the year and are expected to get a lift from the popular show Fallout, which is one of the most-watched programs on Amazon Prime Video.\nThe generative AI boom across the market, meanwhile, is expected to benefit Amazon\u2019s results not only in the first quarter but all through the year. It is likely to increase demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS) as well as the company\u2019s Bedrock AI-platform building tool. Bedrock, which helps in making personalized AI tools, is at present used by umpteen customers, and some notable clients are Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, Pfizer Inc. PFE and Intuit Inc. INTU.\nAmazon\u2019s AI push gained momentum after the e-commerce player recently invested $2.75 billion in the AI startup Anthropic known for developing the chatbot Claude. These deals will give Amazon an upper hand against cloud computing rivals Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nAmazon, by the way, has deployed several cost-cutting measures and initiatives to reshape the future of retail business. These encouraging moves will certainly help the company mitigate bottlenecks related to regulatory issues.\nTherefore, Amazon in all likelihood is a market darling and its estimated earnings and revenue growth rates for the current year are 42.1% and 11.6%, respectively. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 1.5% over the past 60 days.\nAmazon continues to competently generate profits since it has a return on equity of 16.6%, which is typically considered good. Now, the company may have a low net profit margin of nearly 5.3% but it fares well compared to the industry\u2019s negative margin of 1.3%, an indication that most of its peers\u2019 businesses are unprofitable.\nComing to valuation, Amazon\u2019s stock is undeniably pricey. By looking at the Price/Earnings ratio, Amazon presently trades at 43.65 forward earnings. The industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple, on the other hand, is 28.05. However, this means market participants believe that the stock can generate more profits in the future, eventually increasing its demand and price as well.\nAmazon, rightfully, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "Title": "Amazon reports strong 1Q results driven by its cloud-computing unit and Prime Video ad dollars",
        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon on Tuesday reported strong results for the first quarter, driven by growth in its cloud-computing unit and new advertising dollars from its Prime Video streaming service.\nThe Seattle-based e-commerce giant said it brought in $143.31 billion in revenue in the first three months of this year, a 13% jump compared to the same period last year. Net income came out to $10.43 billion, or 98 cents per share. That soundly beat Wall Street analysts' expectations for 84 cents a share, according to FactSet.\n\u201cIt was a good start to the year across the business, and you can see that in both our customer experience improvements and financial results,\u201d Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.\nThe nation\u2019s biggest online retailer is coming off better-than-expected results for the holiday shopping period, when it saw strong consumer spending aided by discounts and faster shipping speeds. Amazon held another discount event in late March, right before the end of the first quarter.\nOverall, U.S. consumer spending has continued to grow despite higher prices and higher borrowing costs resulting from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes. The nation\u2019s economy slowed down during the first three months of this year, but hiring has also remained robust.\nAmazon's U.S. customers are being \u201cvery thoughtful\u201d about their spending, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in a call with reporters. He noted consumers are looking for deals and trading down, and that the company is \u201cparticularly\u201d seeing lower spending in Europe.\nAside from its core retail business, Amazon said first-quarter sales in its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, amounted to $25.04 billion, up 17% from the same period last year.\nAWS, whose customers are mostly businesses, has been the cornerstone of Amazon\u2019s strategy in the competitive artificial intelligence race among big tech companies. The unit saw a slowdown in growth last year as companies cut back on costs amid concerns about the economy. However, Amazon has been using its AI offerings to push back on that trend and attract more enterprises to its cloud business.\nJassy said AI capabilities have reaccelerated AWS' growth rate and it is now on pace for $100 billion in annual revenue.\nHours before Amazon released its earnings report on Tuesday, the company announced a full rollout of a business chatbot called Q that it says can help employees be more productive at work. Last month, it finished its $4 billion investment in San Francisco-based AI startup Anthropic, a competitor to Microsoft-allied OpenAI. Anthropic is collaborating with Amazon to develop so-called foundation models that underpin AI technologies.\nSales in the company's online advertising business also spiked 24%, majority of which is driven by advertising for sponsored products, Olsavsky said.\nHe said Amazon, which started showing advertisements on Prime Video in late January, currently has a \u201clight\u201d number of ads on the streaming service compared to TV or other streaming providers. Olsavsky said the ads, which customers can avoid with a $2.99 additional monthly fee, are going well and \u201cattracting a number of new advertisers who are not currently using Amazon advertising services.\u201d\nShares in Amazon.com Inc. rose about 2% in after-hours trading.\nUnder Jassy, Amazon has cut costs in different parts of its business to remain profitable. This year, the company cut hundreds of positions across AWS, Prime Video and MGM Studios. Its subsidiaries, the popular social media platform Twitch and the audiobook service Audible, have also laid off workers.\nIn addition, Amazon has also been facing regulatory hurdles. In January, the company called off a deal to purchase the robot vacuum maker iRobot after facing regulatory hurdles in Europe. It's also been sued by the Federal Trade Commission over antitrust concerns.\nAmazon says it expects to post net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion during the second quarter. Analysts are expecting $150.2 billion, according to FactSet.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s \u201cshow-me\u201d moment will arrive on Tuesday when its earnings become the latest litmus test on appetite for heavy artificial intelligence spending.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTruce Talks Shift to Qatar as Hamas Hits Israel Border Crossing\nFrance\u2019s Macron Calls for Reset of Economic Ties With China\nBuffett Praises Apple After Trimming It, Drops Paramount Stake\nEverything Apple Plans to Show at May 7 \u2018Let Loose\u2019 iPad Event\nWorsening Weather Is Igniting a $25 Billion Market\nThe message so far from investors: shares of firms that demonstrate progress in monetizing AI will be rewarded, while firms that don\u2019t will see their stock price punished.\nLast week\u2019s misfire by Meta Platforms Inc. triggered a roughly $400 billion selloff in tech stocks amid concerns about the benefits of heavy spending on artificial intelligence. Later results from Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. eased those fears.\nWhen Amazon reports, scrutiny will be on its web services segment, where it uses generative AI. Options traders are pricing in a move of nearly 8% in either direction for the stock a day after the report, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about AWS, how much they\u2019re maintaining market share and then what they\u2019re doing in AI to increase the bottom line,\u201d said Paul Marino of GraniteShares.\n\u201cAmazon has an incredibly steady retail business and that\u2019s all great and they\u2019re a dominant player \u2014 but none of that means anything if what they\u2019re doing in the cloud, and what they\u2019re going to do with AI, doesn\u2019t bear fruit.\u201d\nShares of Amazon fell as much as 1.4% on Tuesday, after advancing 4% over the previous two trading days.\nAmazon believes generative AI cloud services can generate billions in revenue in the coming years, and has invested heavily in the technology to ramp up.\nCrucial to how well its report is received is how Amazon communicates its outlook, with Meta\u2019s slump last week partly coming down to what investors regarded as a lack of clarity. That\u2019s key at a time when traders are rapidly reassessing whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.\n\u201cThey were not very clear about what the next couple of quarters look like, they were not very clear about what AI gains will mean to them in terms of profitability,\u201d said Brian Mulberry, a client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc., of Meta.\n\u201cThe focus is a little bit less right now, I think, on the near term results from the last quarter,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s more about what is your guidance looking like, knowing that interest rates are now going to be higher for longer.\u201d\nRead More: Alphabet\u2019s Cash Boom Is Raising Dividend Hopes on Wall Street\nThe last few megacap earnings reports have also put the return of capital to shareholders in focus. Google parent Alphabet\u2019s share price jump last week was also driven by its announcement of a new dividend and additional $70 billion in buybacks in its earnings release.\nThat leaves Amazon as the final big tech company that doesn\u2019t currently offer a dividend. Investors are awaiting a potential announcement, alongside a possible expansion of its buyback program.\nAmazon is well-liked by Wall Street, with no analyst sell recommendations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average price target implies more than 17% upside from current levels.\nStill, if Amazon doesn\u2019t meet expectations in the quarter or fails to give solid-enough commentary, Meta\u2019s earnings rout offers an uncomfortable example of where investor sentiment currently lies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s priced to perfection. It\u2019s an unbelievable company, it\u2019s a monopoly and very macro-related. I just think it\u2019s over-owned,\u201d said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W.

        "Text": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s examine Amazon.com\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nAccording to our valuation model, Amazon.com seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Amazon.com today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $206.70, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Amazon.com\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Amazon.com. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? AMZN\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AMZN, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Amazon.com from their most recent forecasts.

        "Text": "Tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a sensational long-term investment, thanks to the company's apparent disregard for staying in its lane. It went from being an online store for only books to an e-commerce platform for everything. And then it even went beyond e-commerce to develop business operations for shipping logistics, digital advertising, cloud computing, healthcare services, and more.\nAnother company with an ever-widening business vision is Singapore's Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). The company has an e-commerce platform and a video game division, and offers financial technology (fintech) services. And it's not content to sit in its core Asian markets. Rather, it aspires to have a growing global operation.\nEven though Sea stock is down 85% from its all-time high, I think it's surprisingly a better buy than Amazon stock today. Here's why.\nDon't misunderstand: Amazon is still a great company. The stock is sitting near an all-time high thanks to its soaring operating profits. Indeed, the chart below shows a strong correlation between Amazon's operating profits and its stock price over the last 20 years.\nOver the last decade, Amazon's operating profits have largely soared because of the success of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing services -- AWS supplied 67% of the company's operating income in 2023. But operating profits pulled back in recent years as it invested heavily in logistics to accommodate skyrocketing e-commerce demand.\nAmazon's operating profits are now normalizing as investments wind down. Management expects to earn $8 billion to $12 billion in the upcoming first quarter alone. Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon stock has more upside.\nCompared to Sea stock, Amazon might be a safer bet for making money. That said, Sea stock could have more upside if things go right.\nFirst, it's important to note that Sea stock is cheaper than Amazon stock by the price-to-sales (P/S) metric.\nTo value a stock such as Sea at just 2 times sales suggests that investors don't believe the company can grow -- at least not profitably. But I think the company's recent results disprove both opinions.\nConsider the chart below that breaks down the financial results for all three of Sea's business segments. Officially, the company calls these segments e-commerce, digital entertainment, and digital financial services. Note that the profit column refers to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\nSegment\nRevenue growth\nProfit\nE-commerce\n24%\n($214) million\nDigital entertainment\n(44)%\n$921 million\nDigital financial services\n44%\n$550 million\nData source: Sea's press release. Chart by author.\nOne of Sea's segments has declining revenue, and another has an adjusted EBITDA loss. But as a whole, Sea's revenue was up in 2023, and it was a profitable company. Therefore, the company can grow profitably because it's doing it right now.\nTherefore, the question isn't whether this company can grow profitably; the real question is whether it can capture a large opportunity.\nIt's hard to overstate the opportunities for Sea. The company does business in growing economies that are digitizing at a fast pace, such as Indonesia, Brazil, India, and more. And with these markets comes the potential for growth.\nTake Sea's focus on Brazilian e-commerce, for example. In 2020, the company entered the market. In February, just four short years later, it had already opened its 10th distribution center in the country.\nThese Brazilian distribution centers represent significant investment on Sea's part. But as mentioned, it's a big opportunity. Research group Mordor Intelligence estimates that Brazilian e-commerce is a $53 billion market today. But it predicts it will grow at an astonishing 19% compound annual growth rate through 2029. Other research groups similarly predict double-digit growth. And Sea is building the infrastructure to capitalize.\nSea is spending heavily on e-commerce. But it's worth noting that its growth is becoming more sustainable. In 2023, the business segment did have an adjusted EBITDA loss of $214 million. But this was almost a $1.5 billion improvement, which shouldn't be overlooked.\nIt's not just e-commerce. Sea's financial services division is obviously on fire. It expects a good year for its digital entertainment division as well in 2024, which is fueled by its hit game Free Fire. Management expects a return to double-digit growth this year and could soon relaunch in the massive market of India as it resolves regulatory issues.\nWith only $13 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, Sea has ample room for upside given the size of its markets, growth in those markets, and the strong demand for the products and services that it and its competitors offer.\nWith closer to $600 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, I'd say the upside potential for Amazon is much lower at this point, which is why Sea is a promising company for investors to consider buying today.\nBefore you buy stock in Sea Limited, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sea Limited wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "3 E-Commerce Stocks That Have Outperformed Amazon Over the Past 5 Years",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a top growth stock to own for years. Its massive e-commerce business has helped send its valuation to around $2 trillion today, making it among the largest companies in the world.\nAnd so you might be surprised to learn that over the past five years, it has not been the best e-commerce stock to own. It's not even in the top three. Three e-commerce stocks that have been better buys than Amazon are PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).\nYou may not be familiar with PDD Holdings, but you're likely to know Temu. PDD Holdings owns Temu and the e-commerce site's rising popularity in recent years is one of the reasons PDD Holdings has been doing so well. As one of the most popular e-commerce apps in the U.S., Temu is even driving away shoppers from dollar stores. With cheap products, free delivery, and the ability to do returns on most items within 90 days, it has become an ideal option for frugal shoppers looking to save money.\nPDD Holdings released its latest quarterly numbers last month, and they were impressive. Revenue for the last three months of 2023 totaled $12.5 billion and grew at a rate of 123% year over year. Its net income of $3.3 billion increased by 146% from the same period a year ago.\nWith such incredible growth, it's easy to see why PDD Holdings has been one of the hottest Chinese stocks to own. In five years, the stock rose 440%, while Amazon's gains during that time frame are a more modest 102%. \nAt 21 times its trailing earnings, PDD Holdings still makes for a reasonably priced growth stock to own right now.\nCanadian-based e-commerce company Shopify has also been a growth machine over the years. It helps people sell products and services online, and it makes creating an online shop easy, even for people with limited technical skills. The ease in helping people sell not just locally but internationally has enabled merchants to grow their sales significant through Shopify's platform.\nFrom just $2.9 billion in sales in 2020 to $7.1 billion this past year, the company's performance has been impressive. The one drawback that has investors hesitant about the business is that Shopify's bottom line isn't all that great. In the past two years, it has incurred an operating loss. Much like with other tech businesses, Shopify overestimated pandemic-fueled growth trends, and has now had to retreat and cut costs to improve its earnings.\nThe company did report an operating profit in its two most recent quarters, but the stock could perform even better if management can improve the bottom line. \nIn five years, Shopify's stock surged 280%. Given its limited profits, the stock's valuation could look extreme -- it trades at more than 750 times its trailing earnings. But if you're willing to be patient with the business as it continues to right-size operations and improve its bottom line, this can be another excellent stock to hold for the long term.\nOften referred to as the \"Amazon of Latin America,\" MercadoLibre is another promising e-commerce stock that has generated impressive returns. Focused on the Latin American markets, the company is in 18 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. It also has more than 100 million unique active users.\nLike Amazon, the company also has a subscription service, Meli+, which is similar to Amazon Prime. Through Meli+, users can get free shipping and access to video and music streaming services.\nMercadoLibre is coming off a great year in 2023, with net revenue rising by 37% to $14.5 billion. Net income of $987 million also doubled from the $482 million that the company reported a year earlier.\nIn five years, the stock has climbed 196%, as it too has been an Amazon-beating investment during that time frame. But at 77 times earnings, MercadoLibre's valuation may be a bit high. If, however, you're willing to buy and hold, the stock may still be a tenable investment, given the opportunities in Latin America, and it's a great way to diversify your portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in PDD Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PDD Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Amazon Stock a Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer out of Seattle nearly 30 years ago. The innovative company has expanded into multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\nAmazon's success has seen its financials flourish, with its annual revenue, operating income, and free cash flow soaring over the past five years. Meanwhile, its market capitalization hit $1.9 trillion in 2024, making it the world's sixth-most-valuable company and comparable to tech giants Alphabet, Nvidia, and Apple.\nThe company is on a promising growth path and seems nowhere near to hitting its ceiling as it continues to profit from the tailwinds of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. So, here's why Amazon's stock is a screaming buy right now.\nOne of the best reasons to invest in Amazon is its proven reliability under strain. An economic downturn in 2022 caused a marketwide sell-off, resulting in the Nasdaq Composite plunging 33% during the year. Retailers were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. Shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.\nHowever, the company has made an impressive recovery, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.\nA range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business, and its free cash flow has skyrocketed 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.\nAmazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. Investors who sold the company's stock in 2022 will not have benefited from its significant growth since then.\nAccording to Statista, the e-commerce market is projected to hit $3.6 trillion this year and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% until at least 2028. Amazon's leading 38% market share in online retail therefore looks like the gift that will just keep on giving. The company's role in the industry is paramount, proven by Walmart's second-largest share of just 6%.\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue among its three segments.\nAWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI, a market projected to develop at a CAGR of 37% until at least 2030. As the world's biggest cloud service provider, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\nSo, it's unsurprising that the cloud company is investing heavily in the budding sector. In 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. The platform launched Bedrock, a program that helps customers build generative AI applications. It also unveiled CodeWhisperer, capable of generating code for developers, and HealthScribe, a tool that can transcribe patient-to-physician conversations.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\nThe tech giant is on a promising growth path, and earnings-per-share estimates seem to support its significant potential.\u00a0The chart above indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 44, you get a stock price of $308.\nThis projection would see Amazon's stock rise 66% from its current value over the next two fiscal years. The company's shares are a screaming buy right now and worth considering before its share price surges.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, a sign that the retailer\u2019s most profitable unit is recovering from a slump as businesses resume spending on technology projects, including artificial intelligence services.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIsrael Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Far Short\nAt $2 Million Per Minute, Treasuries Mint Cash Like Never Before\nEx-Trump Controller Says Cohen Repaid From Personal Account\nJack Dorsey Leaves Bluesky Board, Calls X \u2018Freedom Technology\u2019\nTruce Talks Drag as Hamas Hits Israel Crossing in Deadly Attack\nDespite the strong cloud performance, the company\u2019s sales forecast for the current quarter fell short of estimates, reflecting concern about the main e-commerce business as consumers continue to spend cautiously.\nChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy in recent years has cut costs and focused on profitability in Amazon\u2019s online shopping business, laying off thousands of people and touting a more efficient warehouse network. At the same time, he\u2019s backed big investments in artificial intelligence services that Amazon expects to generate tens of billions in revenue in the coming years. Those sales are starting to materialize.\nThe Seattle-based company posted first-quarter operating profit of $15.3 billion. Revenue increased 13% to $143.3 billion in the period ended March 31, Amazon said Tuesday in a statement. Both figures topped analysts\u2019 estimates.\nSales in the Amazon Web Services cloud unit were $25 billion, up 17% from a year earlier. Analysts estimated AWS sales of $24.1 billion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing strong demand signals from our customers on the AWS side,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. \u201cThey\u2019re signing longer deals with larger commitments, many with generative AI components.\u201d Olsavsky said generative artificial intelligence now represented a \u201cmulti-billion dollar revenue run rate business\u201d for Amazon, the first time the company has publicly put even an approximate figure on that franchise.\nThat will come at a cost. The AI chatbots, data-crunching tools, and other software that respond to queries from users are possible only thanks to massive quantities of cutting-edge computer chips. Olsavsky said Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures would \u201cmeaningfully increase\u201d in 2024, primarily to support AWS growth, including for generative AI. The company has said it will spend more than $150 billion to build out and operate data centers in the coming years.\nSales growth at the cloud unit had slowed to a record low last year as businesses cut back on technology spending and sought to curb computing bills that ballooned during the pandemic. Investors have been banking on a rebound this year, particularly after strong results last week from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon\u2019s two main rivals in the business of renting computing power and data storage.\nAWS generated a profit of $9.42 billion in the quarter. The unit\u2019s operating margin \u2014 37.6% \u2014 is the widest since Amazon began disclosing sales for its cloud business. The division held its largest-ever layoffs last year, and has continued to trim its ranks selectively, even as it hires in other areas.\nAmazon said revenue will be $144 billion to $149 billion in the period ending in June. Analysts, on average, projected $150.2 billion.\nThe company\u2019s main e-commerce business reported sales of $54.6 billion in the quarter, slightly missing analysts\u2019 estimates. Olsavsky said consumers continue to trade down to save money. Shoppers are ordering more consumables, which they need quickly, but also cost less than other categories, he said. That puts pressure on the profitability of the business because Amazon has to process and deliver more units.\nThe slowing e-commerce sales also have pushed Amazon to seek greater growth for other business lines. For example, advertising revenue rose 24% to $11.8 billion. The results reflect the first quarter since Amazon introduced video advertising to the Prime Video streaming service.\nAmazon shares gained 3.2% to $180.59 as the markets opened in New York. As of the Tuesday close, the stock had jumped about 15% this year.\n(Updates with shares in last paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nChris Dixon\u2019s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto\u2019s Grifty Reputation\nThe State of Crypto Is Anything But Strong\nWhy Banks These Days Are So Excited About Being Boring\nAI Is Helping Automate One of the World\u2019s Most Gruesome Jobs\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock gained ground in Wednesday's trading. The company's share price ended the daily session up 2.3%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAmazon published its first-quarter results after the market closed yesterday, reporting sales and earnings for the period that beat the average analyst estimate. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant reported earnings per share of $0.98 on sales of $143.3 billion. For comparison, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post per-share earnings of $0.83 on revenue of $142.55 billion.\nAmazon's revenue climbed 12.5% year over year in the first quarter. The company's North America segment saw an increase of 12% year over year to reach $86.3 billion. Meanwhile, sales for Amazon Web Services (AWS) rose 25% year over year to $25 billion, and international segment sales increased 10% year over year to hit $31.9 billion.\nFollowing the strong Q1 sales and earnings beats, Amazon stock rose as much as 5.8% in the daily trading session. But the tech giant's share price lost some ground as investors weighed the company's forward guidance.\nFor the second quarter, Amazon is guiding for sales to come in between $144 billion and $149 billion, suggesting growth of roughly 9% at the midpoint of the target. However, the guidance fell short of the average Wall Street analyst estimate's call for revenue of $150.09 billion in the period.\nOn the other hand, Amazon does anticipate a substantial improvement for Q2 operating income. The company is guiding for operating income to come in between $10 billion and $14 billion, improving dramatically from the $7.7 billion in operating income that it recorded in last year's quarter.\nWith artificial intelligence powering strong demand for AWS and opening the doors for dramatic efficiency improvements for the company's e-commerce business, Amazon stock looks like a smart buy on the heels of its first-quarter report. Even if second-quarter sales guidance fell short of Wall Street's target, the tech leader's long-term prospects remain very promising.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

The states with the most Amazon warehouse locations are California, Texas, Illinois, Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\u201cAs we further optimize our network, we\u2019ve seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, which is an important driver for reducing our costs,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to consolidate more units into a box. It results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve and lowers our carbon impact.\u201d\nAmazon is also making \u201cefforts to revamp our U.S. inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers,\u201d Jassy said.\nSo far in 2024, Amazon has reduced its air cargo operations from 53 to 47 U.S. airports, including closing its air cargo operation at the San Antonio International Airport in April.\nAmazon currently has 1.52 million employees across the globe, a 4% y/y increase compared to the same period in 2023.\nJassy also discussed Supply Chain by Amazon, a new logistics-as-a-service offering announced in September. Supply Chain by Amazon is an end-to-end supply chain service across all channels to shippers that don\u2019t have to be on Amazon\u2019s e-commerce platform.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just really early days, it is not something that we anticipate being a giant capital expense driver for us, we have to build a lot of those capabilities anyway to handle our stores business,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cWe think it will be a modest increase on top of that to accommodate third party sellers. But our third-party sellers find high value with us being able to manage those components for them versus having to do it themselves.\u201d\nMore articles by Noi Mahoney\nChina boosts its Mexico investments as nearshoring opportunities grow\nTruckstop CEO: Industry uniting in fight against load board fraud\nBorderlands Mexico: US-Mexico trade rises to $67B in February\nThe post Amazon reports $143B in Q1 revenue, topping Wall Street expectations appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.31 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 36.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of 24.69%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nAmazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $143.31 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $127.36 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nAmazon shares have added about 19.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%.\nWhat's Next for Amazon?\nWhile Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amazon: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.94 on $150.25 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.12 on $641.69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 17% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nAnother stock from the same industry, Solo Brands, Inc. (DTC), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 9.\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -93.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\nSolo Brands, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $80.48 million, down 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Amazon is selling tiny houses for less than $20,000 apiece\u2014and the internet loves the unboxing videos",
        "Author": "  Chris Morris ",
        "Text": "Housing isn\u2019t cheap. The average sales price for houses sold in the country was $492,300, as of the fourth quarter of last year. But you can find one for under $20,000 on Amazon\u2014sort of.\nBasically, Amazon sells everything, and it\u2019s offering several prefabricated homes, ranging from a 7 x 20 ultratiny house for just under $14,000 to a 19 x 20 one for $19,000 (actually, make that $18,000, since you can apply a $1,000 coupon to the price). Of course, nothing is ever that easy. You\u2019ll need to supply a few things yourself: a tract of land to put the house on, along with a power source and water supply. But the tiny home does come equipped with a toilet, a shower, and some cabinets\u2014door locks too.\nThe listing isn\u2019t new, but it has come into the spotlight lately after a YouTuber bought one and the video went viral. Between the original YouTube video and its secondary form on Twitter, the video has already racked up almost 14 million views.\nThe so-called house is shipped in a folded state. Once it arrives, you'll have to fold out the walls (probably with some help) and ceiling to expand it to its full size. Furniture, of course, is not included.\nIt\u2019s an unusual sort of place to live. And while it might not stand up to extreme weather, prefab housing has actually been called one of the most environmentally friendly ways to build a house, as it results in less waste and it can be erected quickly. The business of prefabricated homes is a bit more complicated\u2014Veev, \u201ca real estate developer turned tech-enabled homebuilder,\u201d as TechCrunch once described it, that reached unicorn status, shut down last year.\nStill, the tiny home movement has increased in popularity in the last couple of decades, as millennials pushed back against \u201cMcMansions\u201d and housing prices soared\u2014more recently being posed as a promising, albeit imperfect solution to the housing crisis. Fortune previously spoke to a 24-year-old who opted for a tiny home in her parents' backyard and managed to save enough money to buy a $250,000 house; she also gained a TikTok following because of her tiny-housing lifestyle.\nAmazon has been selling tiny homes since long before the pandemic. The first noted offering on the site came in 2017, but carried a much steeper price of $36,000\u2014although it did come with heat and air conditioning. Those particular Amazon homes, though, are no longer available.\nAmazon isn\u2019t the first retailer to sell homes; Sears sold tens of thousands of houses via a mail-order catalog from 1908 to 1942. The offerings weren\u2019t prefabricated homes, but kits that had most of the materials needed to build a house. Prices started at just $452 for those way back when. More recently, Home Depot began selling tiny homes and accessory dwelling units\u2014one being a 444-square-foot, two-bedroom home that\u2019ll cost you $63,000.\nAnd if it\u2019s not tiny homes per se, it\u2019s builders building smaller homes, as Fortune has previously reported. Last year the median new-home size fell to its lowest point in more than a decade, census data shows.\nBut all in all, this goes to show that Amazon really is the \u201ceverything store.\" From books to deodorant, apparel, paper towels, and groceries\u2014you can add tiny homes to the list now.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday asked a judge to force Amazon to reveal what it tells company leaders about using the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss sensitive topics and about preserving documents related to antitrust matters, according to a new court filing.\nIn its filing, the FTC said it seeks \"to compel Amazon to produce documents related to the company\u2019s failure to preserve Signal messages, namely Amazon\u2019s document preservation notices and its instructions about the use of ephemeral messaging applications, including Signal.\"\nThe filing marks the latest salvo in what could be a years-long antitrust battle between the regulatory agency and the Seattle-based tech giant. In September, the Lina Khan-run FTC filed a historic suit against Amazon, arguing that the Jeff Bezos-founded company has illegally maintained a monopoly and artificially raised prices for consumers through policies and practices related to the treatment of its hundreds of thousands of Amazon sellers. Amazon has said the suit is meritless and that it will fight it in court; a trial is not slated to begin until October 2026.\nIn the fall, the FTC alleged that Amazon executives destroyed evidence by using Signal for communications for several years after the agency had informed the company in 2019 that it was under investigation and should preserve all relevant documents and correspondences. The agency has said that executives, including Bezos and current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, used Signal, which includes a disappearing-message feature that can permanently delete messages if the user turns it on.\n\"Amazon executives deleted many Signal messages during Plaintiffs\u2019 pre-Complaint investigation, and Amazon did not instruct its employees to preserve Signal messages until over fifteen months after Amazon knew that Plaintiffs\u2019 investigation was underway,\" the FTC claims in the new filing. \"It is highly likely that relevant information has been destroyed.\"\nAmazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement: \"The FTC has a complete picture of Amazon\u2019s decision-making in this case including 1.7 million documents from sources like email, internal messaging applications, and laptops (among other sources), and over 100 terabytes of data.\u201d\nWhen the FTC's original allegations about evidence destruction went public in the fall, Amazon called them \"baseless\" and argued that Amazon had \"voluntarily\" disclosed the use of Signal to the agency and turned over messages that hadn't automatically been deleted.\nBut in the new filing, the FTC claims that Amazon only did so six days before a news report reported on the use of Signal by company executives.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 30, 2024\nAmazon.com, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.978, expectations were $0.82.\nOperator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a presentation, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndy Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making. Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want.\nFor instance, in the US, we recently welcomed Clinique and two Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our GenAI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment.\nAs our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the US. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest US metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about three out of four items were delivered the same or next day.\nFaster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped to lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience. One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes.\nAs we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our cost. When we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact. Another prominent example is our efforts to revamp our US inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans. Advertising performance remained strong with ad sales up 24% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nThe strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we're just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It's very early for streaming TV ads but we're encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.\nAnd given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere. We're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure.\nAnd with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging gen AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already. You heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities at all three layers of the Gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon, training, and inference is quite high, given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives.\nLarger quantities of our latest generation, Trainium 2 is coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025. Companies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker, our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster than SageMaker, Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under seven months using SageMaker. This change is how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker.\nThe middle layer of the stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch, but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model, or LLM, customize it with their own data, and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure high-quality, low-latency, cost-effective production Gen AI apps. This is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand model's knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models. Bedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including Adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair, and Toyota.\nIn the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best-performing models in the planet right now; Meta's Llama 3 models; Mistral's Various models, Cohere's newest models, and new first-party Amazon Titan models. A week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a sneaky big launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met. As increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality production-grade Gen AI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their applications.\nCustomers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these two linchpins services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing. The top of the stack are the Gen AI applications being built. And today, we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and leveraging company's internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code, it also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones.\nIn the near future, Q will help developers transform their dotNET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. Q also has a unique capability called Agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, everything from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature such as asking it to create an add to favorites feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files and suggested new functions. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan, and then the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across multiple files, code blocks and test suites.\nIt's quite handy. On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, Internet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3 and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories. And it will search all this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, engage in dialogue with customers about this data. We also introduced today a powerful new capability called Q Apps, which lets employees describe a natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data and Q Apps will quickly generate that app.\nThis is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data. Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data, but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors and catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, Bridge Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slam, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q, and we've only been in beta until today.\nI'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these gen AI services. It's less sexy, but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening in the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS. We expect the combination of AWS' reaccelerating growth and high demand for gen AI to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which given the way the AWS business model works is a positive sign of the future growth.\nThe more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way. We remain very bullish on AWS. We're at $100 billion-plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And this is before you even calculate gen AI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There is a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments.\nOur emerging international stores are growing and moving towards profitability. Our third-party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon shipping and multichannel fulfillment continues to grow well. We just launched a Prime delivery grocery benefit that lets customers receive free unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year in Manhattan, we're launching a new smaller Whole Foods market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop. Prime Video continues to produce compelling content with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of a very successful Roadhouse movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content.\nOur health services business is growing robustly as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in eight cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year with customers now getting first fill medications 75% faster year-over-year nationwide. And Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial data. There's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity. I'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple of points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate. Second, while I typically talk about growth rates, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the US dollar, more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million or 50 basis point headwind to revenue relative to what we guided.\nExcluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by strong operational performance across all three reportable segments and better-than-expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the international segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nWe remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers: selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we help customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third-party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third-party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year-over-year.\nOperating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates. In our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements and improved volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability.\nLooking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improved profitability in our worldwide stores business while still investing to improve the customer experience. Within our fulfillment network, we are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place and we like the path we're on. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads.\nMoving to AWS. Revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries as companies are shifting their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Additionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish. While there always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts.\nAWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage. As we've said in the past, over time, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases.\nIn 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals, making bigger commitments. Still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q2. Net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion or to grow between 7% and 11%, compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter.\nOur Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe, where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the US. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way.\nWith that, let's move on to your questions.\nSee also\n20 Biggest Natural Gas Companies in Australia, 2024 and\n13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n"

        "Title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Amazon (AMZN)",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAmazon (AMZN) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 7.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 41.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 25.2%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -5.6%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.9%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Amazon have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Here's Exactly How Amazon Stock Could Double Again by 2030",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has more than doubled since the beginning of 2023. So far in the 21st century, it has doubled five times plus additional big gains.\nGenerating 100% returns isn't as easy with a market cap of nearly $1.9 trillion. It's not impossible, though. Here's exactly how Amazon's stock could double again by 2030.\nAmazon can't double on its own. It needs some macroeconomic help. In particular, the chances that Amazon stock will double over the next six and a half years improve significantly if the U.S. avoids a prolonged economic recession.\nDuring the Great Recession, Amazon's stock plunged as much as 65%. A repeat of such a steep decline would definitely make it harder for shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant to soar 100% or more by 2030.\nThe ideal environment for Amazon would be low inflation, low unemployment, and robust economic growth in the U.S. and other major markets where the company operates. The stronger the global economy is, the greater the probability Amazon's stock will double.\nA booming economy alone likely won't be enough to drive Amazon's share price 100% higher. I think Amazon must also benefit from a massive artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has said in the past that less than 10% of global IT spending is currently in the cloud but could grow to over 90% within the next 10 to 15 years. AI could help make Jassy's prediction come true -- and perhaps in a shorter period than he envisions.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading cloud services provider. It would almost certainly enjoy significant growth if AI sparks a surge in migration to the cloud. Of course, AWS has strong competition. However, Amazon is investing heavily in AI and appears to have a good overall AI strategy.\nThe company could also continue to reap the rewards from its AI investments through improved efficiency in its e-commerce business. Higher margins translate to higher profits. If Amazon's earnings grow rapidly, its share price will follow suit.\nPerhaps the biggest mistake made by many investors about Amazon in its early days was seeing the company as only an online bookseller. Amazon had much greater ambitions. Books were just a start that helped it catapult into additional markets.\nThe odds that Amazon's stock double by 2030 improve tremendously if the company can conquer new markets. Amazon's recent initiatives highlight some areas where it could be successful in the coming years. For example, the company has expanded into healthcare with Amazon Pharmacy and the acquisition of primary care provider One Medical.\nAdvertising presents an obvious big opportunity for Amazon. In the fourth quarter of 2023, advertising was the company's fastest-growing business by far. I expect this momentum to accelerate with Amazon running ads on its Prime Video streaming service.\nEven though Amazon's deal to acquire iRobot fell apart, home robotics looks like a great fit for the company's expansion strategy. I could see Amazon moving more into the fintech space as well.\nEven if Amazon enjoys favorable macroeconomic trends, receives a boost from AI, and successfully expands into new markets, can its shares really double by 2030? I think it's quite possible.\nA 100% return by the end of 2030 translates to a compound annual growth rate of around 11.3%. Amazon's earnings increased by 14% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. If the company can keep up this growth rate, its stock has a good shot of doubling or more by 2030.\nI wouldn't bet the farm on Amazon delivering a 2x gain over the next six and a half years. However, I wouldn't bet against the stock achieving the feat either.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 22% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Amazon.com's  ROE today.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n15% = US$30b \u00f7 US$202b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15.\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nTo start with, Amazon.com's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 16%. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 5.7% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Amazon.com's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 14% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\nGiven that Amazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

        "Title": "Is It Worth Investing in Amazon (AMZN) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.3% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>The ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nShould You Invest in AMZN?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.08.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com said on Wednesday it plans to push its cashierless shopping technology into more third-party stores this year, even as it reduces its reliance on the technology in its own.\nThe online retailer said about 140 stores use the system, known as \"Just Walk Out,\" which allows customers to scan an app to enter a store and leave with their items without paying at a register. Amazon will more than double that number this year.\nThe company refuted a report by tech site The Information this month that the technology relies on human reviewers in India to watch customers as they shop.\n\"Associates don\u2019t watch live video of shoppers to generate receipts \u2014 that\u2019s taken care of automatically by the computer vision algorithms,\" Amazon said in a release. However, it said human reviewers are necessary to help improve accuracy.\nThe expansion of Just Walk Out tech to third party stores, such as stadiums and Hudson News locations at airports comes as Amazon plans to take the technology out of its own existing Fresh grocery stores.\nInstead it will rely on \"smart\" shopping carts that log users items and charge them when they leave the stores, sending a digital receipt. Amazon said Fresh customers spend more when they use the carts than those not using the carts.\nAmazon has been trying to keep pace with Walmart and others with its Fresh stores, delivery options, and the buyout of Whole Foods in 2017 for more than $13 billion.\nJust Walk Out, however, has been plagued by hiccups including customer confusion over how it works, missed items, and delays in sending receipts, sometimes taking hours or even days.\nAmazon earlier this month cut hundreds of jobs from its physical retail team, among a slew of reductions in the past few months.\nIt has made several attempts at brick-and-mortar store concepts that it subsequently backed off from, including bookstores and shops featuring products that were highly reviewed on its website.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Bill Berkrot and Nick Zieminski)\n"

Wall Street expects 78 cents in EPS and $133.1 billion in revenues as the company reports after market hours.\nAmazon stock has been buoyed by the company\u2019s strong positioning in AI, cloud computing, and e-commerce.

With over 750,000 robots deployed, Amazon is aiming to reduce fulfilment costs and increase efficiency. This automation drive has already shown results, with fulfilment costs growing less than overall revenue, indicating potential significant cost savings in the future.\nAlso Read: Amazon\u2019s AWS Mega Investment Marks Indiana\u2019s Biggest Capital Infusion Ever\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Amazon\u2019s stock is currently experiencing a bullish resurgence with slight buying pressure.\nChart: Benzinga Pro\nAmazon stock\u2019s price is trading above its key short-term moving averages, reflecting positive market momentum.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is removing its cashierless Just Walk Out system from grocery stores, a retreat from an ambitious technology designed to let shoppers skip the line.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrumpism Is Emptying Churches\nRBC Fires CFO Ahn After Probe Into Personal Relationship\nSaudis Scale Back Ambition for $1.5 Trillion Desert Project Neom\nThe Odds of $100 Oil Are Rising as Supply Shocks Convulse the Market\nTurkey Joins NATO Allies in Suspending Europe Arms Treaty\nAmazon will pull the system as it remodels existing Fresh grocery stores and won\u2019t feature it in new locations that will start opening later this year, an Amazon spokesperson said.\nTony Hoggett, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of grocery stores, joined the company in 2022 and launched a far-reaching revamp of the grocery business, which has struggled to build market share in an industry dominated by the likes of Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co.\nAmazon plans to rely more heavily on its Dash Cart, which lets shoppers scan items as they go. But the company has dialed back the complexity of the technology.\nThe carts initially used a set of cameras to automatically identify what shoppers had grabbed from the shelf. Newer versions stripped out some cameras, and shoppers are now asked to hold the item in front of a pair of scanners, which can read bar codes among other cues. Shoppers can also use a touchscreen to ring up merchandise, such as produce, that lacks bar codes.\nThe Information reported the scrapping of Just Walk Out technology earlier.\nThe system uses ceiling-mounted cameras and shelf sensors, backed by algorithms, to determine what a shopper took from a store. Customers are charged automatically upon exiting.\nThe company began developing the technology more than a decade ago, part of a push by Jeff Bezos, then chief executive officer, to develop a unique offering to accompany Amazon\u2019s move into physical stores.\nThe technology debuted in 2018 with the opening of a convenience store in the lobby of Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters. The company built dozens of Amazon Go branded convenience stores and later installed the cashierless system in Fresh Stores and a pair of Whole Foods Market locations.\nThe technology alienated some shoppers, who were put off by entry gates or the feeling that Amazon had turned a visit to the grocery store into a high-tech vending machine. Receipts, which arrived digitally a few minutes to hours after a shopper checked out, also weren\u2019t practical for big shops.\nAmazon Go stores will still use Just Walk Out technology, and the company will continue to license it to other retailers. Smaller stores in the UK also will keep using the system.\n(Updates with more context on Dash Carts in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "Title": "Amazon removed Just Walk Out from many of its own stores but wants to sell the system to others",
        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon wants the public and - especially other businesses - to know it\u2019s not giving up on its Just Walk Out technology.\nAlthough the company is ditching the cashier-less checkout system at its Amazon Fresh grocery stores, it plans to sell the technology to more than 120 third-party businesses by the end of the year. Reaching that goal would double the number of non-Amazon enterprises that use Just Walk Out compared to last year.\n\u201cFor us, really making sure that we can service that third-party market is the most important thing,\u201d Jon Jenkins, the vice president of Just Walk Out at Amazon, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely been reassuring people that we are in this for the long haul.\"\nJust Walk Out uses cameras, artificial intelligence and sensor trackers to determine what\u2019s taken off of shelves, enabling customers to grab what they want and leave if they insert a credit card or another payment method at a store\u2019s entry gate.\nThe retailer first began offering the technology to other businesses \u2013 such as sports stadiums - in 2020, two years after it started using it at Amazon Go convenience stores. Those stores and some Amazon Fresh stores in the U.K. will continue to offer Just Walk Out. But the technology will be replaced with smart carts at Fresh stores in the U.S., Amazon announced this month.\nSmart carts, which are already available in some Amazon Fresh locations, use sensors to identify items placed inside and have screens that allow customers to see nearby deals as well as how much their groceries will cost. Customers can skip the checkout line by scanning and tallying up items on its cameras.\nThe change comes as Amazon is working to revamp its Fresh stores with a mix of technology and traditional grocery offerings that will help it attract more customers. The company's grocery store brands include Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, as well as supermarket chain Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.\nBut Amazon's efforts to become a giant in the U.S. grocery market hasn\u2019t been easy. Early last year, CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that the company was working to find the formula that would allow it to make a larger impact in brick-and-mortar grocery stores.\nJenkins argued that removing Just Walk Out from U.S. Amazon Fresh stores did not reflect a miscalculation by the company. Instead, he described the decision as an outgrowth of an experimentation process to figure out what does and doesn\u2019t work for shoppers.\n\u201cWhat we found is customers in big grocery stores want a shopping assistant to travel along with them,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, \u201cshoppers in smaller store formats tend to be very mission driven. They want to get in and out quickly, with as little friction as possible.\u201d\nAbandoning the technology in many of its own stores could make it challenging for Amazon to sell Just Walk Out to other businesses. But some experts think the move also could expand adoption among smaller-format stores and locations akin to Amazon Go stores.\nJohn Clear, a senior director at the professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal, says he believes cashier-less technology is going to become more common in grab-and-go shopping areas where human interaction tends to be limited, labor is hard to come by and businesses are almost always attempting to cut down on costs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a natural evolution of the technology, kind of expanding where it\u2019s working\" and drawing back where it's not, Clear said.\nIn its attempt to sell its technology to other businesses, Amazon is also trying to counter some recent viral social media posts that claimed the checkout system was not a technological marvel but was instead powered by contractors in India who manually added up items in carts as customers shopped.\nBusiness publication The Information and news website Vox reported in the past that Amazon used human reviewers for the technology, which the company has acknowledged. Jenkins said the company hires associates who take some video clips and label them so they can be used to train the machine learning system.\nBut the notion \u201cpeople in India are watching you shop live in a store and figuring out what you bought is completely inaccurate,\u201d he said.\nIn some cases, when the system was not able to figure out what happened in a store, a human watches a snippet of video to make sure the receipt a customer received was accurate, Jenkins added. Such reviews happen in a \u201csmall minority\u201d of cases, he said, declining to give an estimate.\nJenkins also declined to share how many people the company has hired to review and label videos. However, he said it was less than the 1,000 figure cited in media reports.\n"

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\nThat is because Amazon is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AMZN in this report.\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 87 cents per share for AMZN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AMZN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.51% heading into earnings season.\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Amazon Fresh stores as part of an effort to revamp the grocery chain.\nThe company\u2019s well-known technology lets customers pay for items without standing in line and sends them receipts afterwards. Amazon says it will now be replaced by smart carts that allow customers to skip the checkout line but also see their spending in real time.\nWhile redesigning Fresh stores in the past year, Amazon spokesperson Carly Golden said the company heard from customers who enjoy skipping the checkout line but also wanted to view their receipts and savings as they shopped. Golden said the smart carts will give customers these benefits as well as the convenience of skipping the checkout line.\nAmazon's decision was first reported by The Information.\nSeattle-based Amazon operates dozens of Fresh grocery stores across the country, most of which are in California, Illinois, Virginia and Washington state. The company also operates cashier-free convenience stores under the Amazon Go brand and owns Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.\nDespite predictions Amazon\u2019s entry into the grocery sector would disrupt the market, the company has struggled to find what works.\nIn 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that Amazon was working to find the right formula that will allow it to have a larger impact on physical grocery.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Amazon (AMZN), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\nThis online retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 35.62%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Amazon was expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, but it reported $1.01 per share instead, representing a surprise of 24.69%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.58 per share, while it actually produced $0.85 per share, a surprise of 46.55%.\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Amazon lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nAmazon currently has an Earnings ESP of +8.64%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger and Yuvraj Malik\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com reported quarterly results above Wall Street's expectations on Tuesday, as interest in artificial intelligence helped drive cloud-computing growth.\nCEO Andy Jassy told analysts that for Amazon \"there is a big opportunity in front of us\" in servicing AI customers.\nShares of the Seattle-based e-commerce and tech company climbed less than 2% in extended trade after its current-quarter revenue forecast came in below expectations. The stock closed down 3.3% in the regular session.\nChief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a call that capital spending would increase throughout the year, compared with $14 billion in the first quarter. \"That will be the low point for the year as far as capex by quarter,\" he said.\n\"The majority of that will be to support AWS infrastructure and in particular generative AI efforts,\" he said later on a call with analysts. Amazon is investing upfront to build out its AI offerings to meet customer demand, particularly as customers seek out longer-term contracts, he said.\nAmazon is racing to keep abreast of rivals in offering generative AI software. Competitors include Alphabet as well as Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\nFirst-quarter sales increased 13% to $143.3 billion, higher than the $142.5 billion average, according to LSEG data. Net income more than tripled to $10.4 billion in the first quarter.\nThe company expects revenue of $144.0 billion to $149.0 billion for the current quarter ending June, compared with analyst consensus expectations of $150.07 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\"After a year and a half of cutting cloud costs, it appears that enterprise customers are ready to move more workflows to the cloud again, which is positive not just for Amazon, but also for many software companies that sell to enterprise customers,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the largest provider of cloud-computing services, posted a 17% rise in revenue to $25.0 billion in the first quarter, compared with expectations of $24.53 billion.\nThat compares with a rise in cloud-computing revenue of 31% for Microsoft and 28% for Alphabet for the January-to-March period.\nAI has been a fixation in Silicon Valley since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, fueling billions in funding and a mad dash to put chatbots and other artificially intelligent features into more products. On Tuesday, Amazon said its \"Q\" chatbot for businesses was publicly available and earlier this year it rolled out the Rufus service to help customers on its website find new products.\nJassy in a statement said AWS is now on pace to achieve $100 billion in annual sales.\nAmazon bucked a Big Tech trend of announcing a dividend, after rivals Alphabet and Meta Platforms rolled out the investor goodie. The latter two announcements were cheered by investors who pushed the stock prices higher.\nAmazon and Tesla remain the only members of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that do not offer dividends. Its shares have climbed about 15% in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500's gain of about 6%.\nNet income of $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared with $3.2 billion, or 31 cents per diluted share in 2023's first quarter. That beat analysts' average EPS estimate of 83 cents.\nAmazon's push to build out its advertising business helped results in the quarter. The company took in $11.8 billion in ad sales, up 24% from a year earlier. The company this year added unskippable ads to its Prime Video streaming offering, which Jassy said marketers are excited about. Customers can opt out for $2.99 per month.\nThe company ended the quarter with 1.52 million employees, about 4,000 fewer than at year-end 2023, but higher than a year earlier by 56,000. That was despite Amazon cutting at least 27,000 jobs last year and continuing to trim positions across a number of units.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Greg Bensinger in San FranciscoAdditional reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, CaliforniaEditing by Anil D'Silva, Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Text": "Significantly high institutional ownership implies Amazon.com's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership\n Insider ownership in Amazon.com is 11%\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amazon.com.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nWe can see that Amazon.com does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amazon.com, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amazon.com. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Jeffrey Bezos (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.0% of the stock.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Amazon.com, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$211b stake in this US$1.9t business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. \nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Amazon.com. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\nUltimately the future is most important.

        "Author": "  Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni ",
        "Text": "By Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni\n(Reuters) - Upcoming quarterly reports from U.S. tech giants may show Microsoft is closing the gap on cloud-computing market leader Amazon.com as more businesses switch to its services, attracted by a clutch of generative AI features that are powered by OpenAI's technology.\nThe Redmond, Washington-based software giant has beaten rivals Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet to the market with AI services including the Copilot, a set of genAI tools that work in Microsoft's business apps, that was rolled out in November for $30 a month.\nIts earnings on Thursday will be an indicator of AI adoption and could influence the movement of technology stocks as a rally in the sector eases this month amid worries that interest rates in the U.S. could stay high for longer.\nWall Street analysts expect Microsoft - which overtook Apple as the world's most valuable firm earlier this year - to report that the billions of dollars it has invested in generative AI were attracting clients to its Azure cloud-computing service.\n\"Azure is benefiting from a halo effect around Microsoft's AI strategy,\" said RBC Capital Markets Rishi Jaluria, who expects Microsoft to take Amazon's market share.\nJaluria added that cloud providers should broadly benefit from signs of stabilization in technology spending, which has been pressured by high-interest rates and economic uncertainty.\nIn the first three months of 2024, Microsoft's revenue is expected to have grown 15% and Alphabet's 12.6% - their second-highest rate in nearly two years. Amazon's revenue could rise 11.9%, its worst in three quarters.\nAzure, part of the Intelligent cloud unit at Microsoft, is expected to have grown 28.9% in the January-to-March period, according to estimates from Visible Alpha.\nThat compares with estimated growth of 14.9% for Amazon Web Service and 25% for Google Cloud, the third-largest cloud provider, according to LSEG data. Google-parent Alphabet reports earnings on Thursday and Amazon on April 30.\nCFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino estimated that up to 8 percentage points of Azure's growth could come from AI services.\nStill, much of the boost from AI is expected to be realized from next year, with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating a $5 billion revenue contribution from Copilot in Microsoft's fiscal 2025, which would start in July.\n\"Broader elements of generative AI story (like 365 Copilot) likely need more time to develop and work through enterprise purchasing cycles,\" Morgan Stanley said earlier this month.\nWhile Alphabet shares have gained over 13% so far this year and recently scaled a record high on optimism over its AI efforts including the Gemini models, several analysts said the company was not rushing to monetize the technology and that it may take longer for Google Cloud to benefit from AI integration.\nGoogle offers a slew of AI features within Workspace productivity apps, which are powered by its large language model Gemini, for up to $30 per user per month. Earlier this month, it announced two $10 add-on packages for AI meeting notes and summaries, and for added security features.\n\"Our checks at Google Cloud Next conference showed high interest levels and abundant innovation, but no rush to turn AI pilots into production apps,\" said analysts at Jefferies, who see a more meaningful boost in 2025.\nAmazon has not announced any major AI moves but is weaving the technology into AWS on the back of its $4 billion investment in OpenAI-competitor Anthropic.\n\"Microsoft has gained a lot of ground last year based on its AI prominence, but AWS is still a much bigger business and we expect Amazon to catch up to those capabilities over the next couple of years,\" said D.A. Davidson and Co analyst Gil Luria.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Text": "Layoffs in the tech sector aren\u2019t isolated to Silicon Valley, as Seattle-based Amazon sheared hundreds of workers from its cloud division \u2014 a crucial business unit that builds tech for the company\u2019s commerce operation, as well as those of outside retailers and brands.\nOn the chopping block at Amazon Web Services are positions in sales, marketing and global services, in addition to a few hundred roles from its Physical Stores Technology team. The revelation came from internal emails leaked to Geekwire on Wednesday. WWD confirmed the news directly with the company.\nMore from WWD\nThe Body Shop's Subsidiary Enters Into Administration in France\nKlarna Launches 'Wikipink' in a Bold Move for Greater Transparency in Credit Industry\nKering Pays 1.3B Euros for Prime Spot on Via Montenapoleone\nNaturally, Amazon seeks to eliminate duplication in the workforce. A statement from the company chalked up the job cuts to streamlining, while seemingly acknowledging the tough reality of excising several hundred roles. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make these decisions lightly, and we\u2019re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition to new roles in and outside of Amazon,\u201d it said. \u201cThese decisions are difficult but necessary as we continue to invest, hire and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.\u201d\nBut, according to the company, whittling down AWS isn\u2019t just about trimming the fat\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s about focusing on \u201ckey strategic areas\u201d that make the most impact. Those efforts can extend far beyond Amazon\u2019s own retail business and to the AWS\u2019 client base, which includes 1,179 fashion brands, according to data from ReadyContacts.\nThe latest round of layoffs follows earlier cuts that impacted some 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023, as part of chief executive officer Andy Jassy\u2019s cost-cutting campaign. Ultimately, the belt-tightening appears to have worked. In its latest quarterly financials, filed in February, the $170 billion company beat analyst projections for earnings and revenue on the whole, as did particular business units like advertising. The outlier was AWS, whose $24.2 billion haul just barely met expectations.\nThat Amazon would pay particular attention to its cloud unit is hardly a surprise. At the time, chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said AWS saw growth slow over the past year, primarily due clients\u2019 own cost-cutting. On the other hand, he also said that work was picking up. The reason: The artificial intelligence boom. According to Olsavsky, AWS saw \u201ca lot of interest\u201d in its generative AI offerings, such as the Q chatbot for businesses.\nIts most visible efforts may be on the consumer front with launches like the Rufus AI shopping assistant. Meanwhile, it\u2019s busy trying to break new retail ground through its Amazon One biometrics platform, which allows customers to enter brick-and-mortar stores and pay for goods by showing their palms to scanning terminals. Hand-scanning tech looks positioned to take the place of Amazon\u2019s camera-and-sensor-based \u201cjust walk out\u201d system \u2014 which, according to recent reports, it is backing away from its grocery businesses.\nNow the Physical Stores Technology team will surely see some impact from scrubbing hundreds of jobs. The company described the layoffs as part of \u201ca broader strategic shift in the use of some applications in Amazon\u2019s owned as well as in third-party stores,\u201d though it didn\u2019t specify what that meant. In another message to employees, Dilip Kumar, vice president of AWS applications, referenced an impact to checkout teams.\nAltogether, the details paint a picture of Amazon retail being in flux, and how this shakes out at AWS could influence the way retail works across the board and influences sectors like fashion.\nAmazon also pointed out that, although it\u2019s eliminating some positions, it\u2019s in a hiring mode for thousands of others at AWS, while it tries to shift workers internally when possible. U.S.-based workers being laid off will continue to receive pay and benefits for 60 days, support for external placements and transitional health benefits, with some eligible for severance.\nBest of WWD\nRetailers Leverage First Insight for ESG Alignment\nWhat Steph Curry's Sneaker NFTs Can Teach Fashion\nYear in Review: Brands, Retailers Go Hyper-digital in a Challenging Landscape\n"

First quarter sales increased 12% to $143.3 billion and came in slightly above estimates of $142.52 billion. AWS contributed $25 billion to the top line, beating estimates by 3% and increasing 17% year over year as Amazon remains the domestic cloud leader ahead of Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google Cloud.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMore importantly, Amazon\u2019s operating income skyrocketed 221% to 15.3 billion. This led to earnings of $1.13 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus of $0.83 a share by 36% and climbed from $0.31 a share in the comparative quarter.

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Amazon said earlier this month that it was removing its \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d cashierless technology from the 28 Amazon Fresh and two Whole Foods grocery stores in the U.S. that used the system. The news triggered a cascade of headlines declaring the demise of the technology, one of Amazon\u2019s boldest bets to reinvent the way consumers buy products at brick-and-mortar stores.\nThe reality is a bit more complicated. Amazon is not abandoning Just Walk Out technology. In fact, the company says it\u2019s expanding the number of places where it\u2019s available\u2014it\u2019s just focusing on different kinds of venues like airports and sports stadiums. And in grocery stores, Amazon is replacing Just Walk Out technology with fleets of tech-enabled \u201cDash\u201d shopping carts that include item scanners, touch screens that display nearby items, and automatic billing that also allows for skipping the checkout line.\nStill, the fact that Amazon is rolling back Just Walk Out technology in its U.S. grocery stores (U.K. grocery stores will continue to use the technology as of now) is clearly a black eye for Amazon and a setback to its ambitions. Just Walk Out technology was at the heart of the company\u2019s plan to expand into the physical shopping realm by becoming a transformational leader in the business, not just another player.\nTo better understand what the grocery store pullback means for the future of Just Walk Out technology, and how it affects Amazon\u2019s overall physical store strategy, Fortune sat down with Dilip Kumar, an Amazon VP who was one of the inventors of Amazon\u2019s cashierless technology. Kumar, a former \u201cshadow\u201d\u2014or chief of staff\u2014to Jeff Bezos, described the company\u2019s current strategy, and also set the record straight about how much humans are really involved behind the scenes to make Just Walk Out technology work.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity. \nFortune: So what\u2019s really going on with your investment in Just Walk Out technology?\nKumar: This theory of the demise of Just Walk Out is a little overblown. We\u2019re actually doubling down on all the areas where I think it really resonates.\nAnd so what we\u2019re seeing in third-party, small-format stores is that anywhere where there are throughput constraints, wherever people are time-constrained\u2014like stadiums, airports, convention centers, universities, in hospitals\u2014it really is resonating. [Amazon has sold the technology to around 140 third-party convenience stores and concession stands worldwide.]\nWe\u2019re going to be doubling the number of stores this year. I feel like when you tell [businesses] about Just Walk Out it feels like a leap of faith for people to hear, \u201cRip out your point-of-sale system and [use] this completely different customer experience, and trust us, it\u2019s going to work.\u201d And so people start with one store or two, and then they come back and they see that it\u2019s doubling or tripling their sales.\nLike at [Seattle\u2019s] Lumen Field. They started with two stores, and now they have nine. In [Chicago\u2019s] United Center, they started with two stores, and now they have seven. Hudson [airport convenience stores] started with a store, and now they have more than a dozen.\nAnd so I think one of the things that they\u2019re seeing is, it is the single best thing that they can do that doubles, triples their throughput and the number of transactions. But they also find that it is not cannibalistic even if you put multiple locations in the same [building].\nWhy wasn\u2019t the technology a fit for the larger Amazon Fresh stores?\nWhen you think about your grocery trip, it\u2019s not just time that is important. What people also want is the notion of how much are they spending? Where are the items located? Can I get this real-time receipt or tally of knowing exactly what\u2019s going into my cart? Are my coupons being applied? These are a bunch of other things that also become just as important.\nAnd by the way, a lot of these things increase in importance as the size of your trip increases. So as the total amount of dollars that you\u2019re spending increases, as the total amount of time that you\u2019re spending increases, all of these other elements also become important. And for those reasons, we felt like the Dash Cart is a much better platform for experimentation and continued invention in large-format grocery stores rather than Just Walk Out.\nIs that your decision? Or is that [Amazon grocery store SVP] Tony Hoggett\u2019s decision?\nIt was Tony and I. [His team] is in the process of changing how the Amazon Fresh stores are getting designed. They\u2019re sort of moving things around. They\u2019re sort of saying, \u201cWe need certain things in a certain way.\u201d And when you try to do two things [simultaneously] that are constantly evolving, it actually slows a bunch of things down.\nThe cart still allows you to be able to skip the line, but it also has a bunch of these other benefits that are important while you are shopping that customers were telling us about.\nIt also allows the store to be able to make changes with the level that they needed to. [An Amazon spokesman later clarified that the changes to Amazon Fresh stores include adjustments to store layouts and product selection that would require significant retraining of the Just Walk Out technology, but less so for Dash Cart.]\nSo for a variety of reasons, it was the right decision for large-format stores.\nI was still a little surprised by this. I understand all the things you\u2019re telling me that customers have told you, but how much of a factor was the cost differential between the carts and the Just Walk Out system?\nThe carts are always going to be lower cost than any Just Walk Out system \u2026 because one scales with the number of shoppers and the other scales based on the square footage that it has to cover.\nBut \u2026 we felt like there\u2019s a lot of information that happens during the trip, which is relevant, that the carts can provide. With the carts, there\u2019s a little bit more of a human interaction [necessary], but one of the things that we see is that the cart will eventually get to the place \u2026 to being no different than just picking up a traditional cart. Plus there is the augmentation of a bunch of things that are relevant while the person is in the store shopping [compared] to the current Just Walk out experience, where it is completely devoid of any feedback, or any helpful information, until you get [the receipt].\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the test run that GeekWire reporters went through and some of the complaints about the Dash Cart experience, or just things that didn\u2019t go as smoothly as planned. Do you think that\u2019s sort of normal with where you\u2019re at with the cart experience?\nI think their experiences are not what we see from the vast majority of the customer satisfaction scores that we get. We have a 98% customer satisfaction score for our Dash Carts and 80% of Dash Cart shoppers are repeat shoppers.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s always useful to acknowledge what folks went through in their experience, things that we could do better. There\u2019s a bunch of things in the works which will continue to make that experience more and more intuitive for shoppers. Today we require people to use an app to be able to use the cart. But, you know, when Amazon Go started, the only way to enter the store was using an app and a QR code in the app. But since then we said you can use Amazon One [palm scanning], you can use a credit card to enter, you can even use your badge.\nA lot of those kinds of things will happen to the cart as well. A lot of the things like, how intuitive is it, how easy is it to add or remove products. There\u2019ll be plenty of improvements made in that dimension, which I\u2019m already seeing in the next generation. So I\u2019m reasonably confident that we will get closer and closer to the experience where people find these to be invaluable. We\u2019re already seeing that for the subset of customers who use it. But it will become more ubiquitous. Amazon Fresh is going to [continue] rolling these out; we\u2019re going to be launching these with several third-party grocers as well. So we\u2019re getting good feedback from folks, but also things that we know that we have to get better at and make intuitive for the first-time user.\nObviously a big storyline that got distorted over the past couple of weeks was about the team behind the scenes helping to ensure accuracy and also to help train the Just Walk Out technology through labeling and other means. Years ago, I reported before your first Amazon Go store opened to the public that there were some humans working behind the scenes. Can you just clarify what is and isn\u2019t happening with this staff now?\nHumans built this technology. Humans also annotate and label some of these [videos of customers shopping] in order for our algorithms to be able to learn and get trained. We are also generating a lot of synthetic data to train our algorithms. So the combination of this has always been consistent.\nThere were several articles about \u201cOh, people are actually watching these videos in real time.\u201d It was just sort of beyond ludicrous. But it\u2019s also a good point to be able to clarify for folks who are not as involved in this technology and don\u2019t realize how some of these things work.\nWhat humans actually are doing behind the scenes is very useful. All of these algorithms need a little bit of training data in order to be able to generalize. And so when we\u2019re thinking about this, staff are annotating videos, or different video frames, or figuring out who took what, and that requires a series of annotations. And so the humans are actually helping with that aspect of it.\nSo that\u2019s one thing they are doing.\nBut one of the other things is that the system that is generating the output can\u2019t audit itself. So humans actually sample a small sample of videos, in order to ascertain the accuracy [before Amazon provides a Just Walk Out customer with a receipt].\nMachine learning algorithms work on confidence boundaries, like, \u201cHow confident are you that something happened?\u201d And so as the confidence gets lower and lower to a certain threshold, if it\u2019s below, maybe somebody should verify it. But even the things that are really close to that threshold, those are the ones that we would subsample. And we would say, \u201cWhat made us get so close? What would make it more confident? What would make us way more confident that X took Y product or this happened?\u201d\nThose particular sessions are the kinds of things that humans are annotating. It is a very small percentage of these videos that humans actually review as part of the receipt [process]. The vast majority [of receipts] go in on an automated basis.\nSo are you willing to share what percentage of receipts need to be reviewed? \nWe don\u2019t share those numbers. It\u2019s a small portion of the overall number of transactions that get reviewed by humans as a percentage of receipts.\nThere was a report that in 2022 humans were involved in 700 of every 1,000 Just Walk Out sessions. Is that true?\nIn the earlier days when we were creating the large format stores, we tagged and annotated a significant portion of those initial transactions, because it was super important for us to be able to build the algorithms necessary for that. So yes, we did it.\nBut it wasn\u2019t in real time; it wasn\u2019t while the receipt was being generated. What we wanted to do is to be able to tag as many of those sessions as possible. We would tag a lot of sessions, we would then run our algorithms, and then know where there were gaps \u2026 refine it to the next set of things that we didn\u2019t have enough information on \u2026 and lather, rinse, repeat. So yes, we tagged different types of transactions in different quantities, in order to be able to make sure that our algorithms could generalize.\nBut like 700 out of 1,000 for receipts? No. It was probably a combination. I don\u2019t know if it was 700, that sounds high, but we tagged a sufficient amount.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "This Is How Walgreens' New CEO Thinks the Company Can Beat Amazon",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) is in a bit of trouble right now. The company's financial numbers don't look great, it slashed its dividend, and the future of the business is questionable. It's getting deeper into healthcare, but that has the potential to be a costly venture, especially as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and other tech companies have been investing money into healthcare in recent years.\nBut Walgreens' new CEO, Tim Wentworth, thinks the company has an advantage, particularly over a company such as Amazon, which is likely going to rely on its tech capabilities and strong online presence. And its advantage is to have more of a human touch with its customers.\nI was bullish about Walgreens' attempt to get into healthcare in the past because it had a strong reach in the U.S. It has thousands of stores across the country, and many of them are within walking distance for many people. This can make it easier to obtain medication than ordering online, even if same-day delivery is possible. While Amazon has been improving its shipping speed over the years, many seniors may still opt for the in-person experience, especially if they aren't comfortable with technology.\nCEO Wentworth is banking on that in-person experience paying off for the business and being a determining factor in its ability to succeed in the long term. In a recent interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Wentworth said Walgreens' accessibility will set it apart from the competition:\nWe will beat Amazon because of the human interface that we offer in communities and neighborhoods, 8,600 locations today where you can come in if you actually are getting a drug that you want to talk about, if you have a health concern, if you want to get an over-the-counter product to go along with your drug.\nIn 2021, Walgreens announced a $5.2 billion investment into primary-care provider VillageMD; the two businesses plan to launch clinics at 1,000 locations by 2027, spanning 30-plus markets. Walgreens had previously been an investor in VillageMD, but the investment boosted its stake from 30% to 63%.\nThis is, however, still a long-term play for Walgreens. In its most recent quarter, which ended on Feb. 29, the U.S. healthcare business generated $2.2 billion in revenue -- approximately 6% of the company's top line ($37.1 billion). The company incurred massive goodwill impairment charges in VillageMD that totaled $5.8 billion on an after-tax basis. But even on an adjusted basis, the healthcare business reported an adjusted operating loss of $34 million, which was an improvement from a year ago when the adjusted loss totaled $159 million.\nIt'll likely be years before the healthcare business makes a serious impact on Walgreens' financials. Right now, it's a bit of a carrot to entice long-term investors who aren't sold on the pharmacy business, which has been fairly underwhelming, to buy the stock. Walgreens' core U.S. retail pharmacy business generated $28.9 billion in sales last quarter, achieving 4.7% sales growth, compared to the prior-year period. But its adjusted operating income of $752 million declined by nearly 30%.\nWalgreens can potentially offer a better experience for customers, but I'm not optimistic that it will be a determining factor in the ultimate outcome as to whether the business is successful in the long run. Walgreens still has the in-person advantage today with its thousands of stores, and that clearly isn't helping it achieve strong results.\nBy focusing on getting medications to customers as efficiently as possible, Amazon may prove that delivery is the name of the game. For many seniors, mobility is a big issue. And as Amazon continues to get quicker and more efficient, I'm not optimistic Walgreens will be able to compete on that level.\u00a0 Amazon lacks Walgreens' thousand locations, but that doesn't mean it can't offer in-person care.\nIn 2022, Amazon was in the bidding for Signify Health, a home healthcare company that CVS Health ended up acquiring for $8 billion. Amazon has been showing an increasing interest in healthcare. If it expands its footprint to have greater access to patients, it could diminish the advantage Walgreens may think it has in offering personalized care.\nWalgreens may turn things around, but a lot depends on its healthcare strategy. Given that uncertainty, investors are better off staying away from what has become an increasingly risky stock to own over the years.\nIn just the past 12 months, Walgreens has lost close to half its value while also slashing its dividend payments. Unless you're a contrarian investor who is OK with a lot of risk and uncertainty, Walgreens is a stock you'll probably want to avoid right now, given the challenges the business is facing.\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Hawaiian Airlines slowly adds freighters for Amazon business",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Hawaiian Airlines has commenced operating a second Airbus A330-300 cargo jet for Amazon on a new route between New York\u2019s JFK airport and the retail behemoth\u2019s West Coast air logistics hub in San Bernardino, California, the company reported in quarterly earnings Tuesday.\nUnder a\u00a0 transportation services agreement that kicked in last year, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) leases the aircraft from a dealer and transfers them to Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ: HA) to fly and provide routine maintenance. Hawaiian, which is branching out to all-cargo operations for the first time, began commercial revenue service for Amazon in early October on a route connecting San Bernardino with Amazon Air\u2019s superhub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG).\nAmazon plans to acquire 10 A330 converted freighters as replacements for aging Boeing 767-200s operated by other partner airlines. The original schedule called for Hawaiian Airlines to receive eight more freighters this year, but the airline said delivery flow is behind by two aircraft because the airframe repair company responsible for reconfiguring the used passenger jets to carry heavy containers is experiencing production delays. That means Hawaiian will have seven aircraft, instead of nine, in possession by the end of the year, if the current schedule remains intact.\nCEO Peter Ingram said Hawaiian may postpone deploying some cargo aircraft that join the fleet this year in order not to add complexity to Amazon\u2019s network during the busiest shipping period.\n\u201cI would caution that they may not all be flying by the end of the year because during the peak period our partner doesn\u2019t necessarily want to introduce new lines of flying into the operation,\u201d he said on an earnings briefing with analysts.\nAmazon has been operating Boeing 767s between New York-San Bernardino, according to a route map compiled by a team of researchers at DePaul University. Their most recent report, in March, found that Amazon is streamlining its airport network, slowing fleet growth and utilizing larger aircraft like the A330 to improve efficiency.\nIndustry experts say the best use of the A330, from the standpoint of minimizing operating costs, is on the longest routes in Amazon\u2019s network.\nAmazon has always been willing to overfly the CVG hub if aircraft have high load factors, said Derek Lossing, founder of e-commerce logistics consultancy Cirrus Global Advisors and a former senior manager at Amazon Logistics.\n\u201cThe hub is great for when you have to put multiple destinations on a flight to fill it up. But if there is enough New York to Los Angeles volumes, doing a sort at the hub just costs time and extra flying. So if you can fill up aircraft on point to point routes, and they are full or almost full, you actually prefer to avoid the hub,\u201d he explained by email.\nDuring the first quarter, Hawaiian Airlines recorded an adjusted loss of $143.5 million despite a 5.4% increase in revenue to $646 million that benefited from increased system capacity. The operating loss increased 26% year over year as expense growth exceeded revenues.\u00a0 Unit costs increased about 7% year over year, including a point attributed to the Amazon flying. Losses were also higher because of how the company\u2019s lower effective tax rate was booked.\nHigh lodging rates in Hawaii and the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen have contributed to low travel demand from Japan, a key market. The wildfire that destroyed Maui last year has also been a drag on business.\nOn the bright side, Hawaiian expects all its Airbus A321neos back in service within a few weeks after several were sidelined because of problems with Pratt & Whitney engines that required extensive inspections. More than 1,000 P&W engines have been recalled across the industry.\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\u00a0\nAmazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says\nThe post Hawaiian Airlines slowly adds freighters for Amazon business appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Title": "Why Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Crashed on Thursday",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The biggest driver of headlines across the technology sector over the past year or so has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.\nWith that as a backdrop, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.\nTo be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space.\nMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.\nThe company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.\nThe results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.\nLike its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,\" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.\nMeta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, \"We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\nAs a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.\nSo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.\nCompany-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday.\nChinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports.\nThe potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.\nInvestors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs\u00a0Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.\nWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are selling for 33 times, 23 times, and 22 times forward earnings, respectively, while Amazon is trading for roughly 2 times forward sales. Furthermore, all four stocks have easily outpaced the performance of the S&P 500 over the past five years.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all industry leaders on the cutting edge of AI. Investors should ignore the short-term volatility and buy the dip.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has captivated Wall Street during the past year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology and highlighted just how far AI has advanced. AI has huge potential in the coming years as it bolsters industries such as consumer tech, cloud computing, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, and much more.\nIn fact, data from Grand View Research shows the AI market reached about $200 billion last year and is projected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030. So, despite a monster rally for AI stocks last year, it's not too late to invest and benefit from the sector's development over the long term.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options. One dominates the AI chip market, and the other is a leader in cloud computing, one of the fastest-growing areas of AI.\nSo, let's compare these companies and determine whether Nvidia or Amazon is the better AI stock right now.\nNvidia became a favorite on Wall Street last year, with its stock up about 225% since last April. The company's hardware became the gold standard in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) in 2023 as developers worldwide loaded up on its chips. As a result, Nvidia achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI GPUs alongside soaring earnings.\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily due to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's free cash flow was up 430% in the past year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than rival chipmakers AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion. So, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI gave the company an edge, providing it with more significant cash reserves to continue investing in technology and retain market supremacy.\nThe vast potential of AI indicates that chip demand will continue rising, and Nvidia will likely continue to see major gains from the industry.\nAmazon became a household name worldwide thanks to the success of its e-commerce site, responsible for 38% of the online retail market. The company's role in the industry is paramount, with Walmart in a distant second place with a 6% share.\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income despite contributing the smallest portion of revenue among Amazon's three segments.\nAWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI. As the world's biggest cloud service provider, AWS has the potential to leverage its cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\nSo, it's unsurprising that Amazon is investing heavily in this lucrative sector. In 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. The platform launched Bedrock, a program that helps customers build generative AI applications. It also unveiled CodeWhisperer, which is capable of generating code for developers, and HealthScribe, a tool that can transcribe patient-to-physician conversations.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\nNvidia and Amazon have potent positions in AI that will likely allow them to profit from the industry's tailwinds for years.\nHowever, the data below indicates Amazon's stock is currently trading at a much more appealing valuation.\nThis chart shows Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios are significantly higher than the same metrics from Amazon.\nP/S is calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. Meanwhile, price-to-free-cash-flow divides its market cap by free cash flow, which is what's left of cash flow after capital expenditure and operating costs. These are helpful valuation metrics because they consider a company's financial health alongside its share price. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value. And in this case, Amazon's stock is a bargain compared to Nvidia's.\nAmazon's free cash flow hit more than $32 billion last year, while Nvidia reached $27 billion. It's not a huge difference, but it does show Amazon is potentially in a better position to keep investing in its AI technology and overcome potential headwinds.\nAmazon is a tech behemoth on its way to becoming a major threat in AI. It's also a better-valued stock, making Amazon a no-brainer over Nvidia and a screaming buy right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Generative AI is now contributing revenue to Amazon's cloud business at annualized rate equivalent to multiple billions of dollars, re-accelerating growth at Amazon Web Services and providing a business gusher that company officials expect will continue to pay off for decades.\nAmazon recorded its largest quarterly operating profit in its history in the first quarter, the tech giant announced on Tuesday, as Amazon Web Services hit a $100 billion annual revenue run rate and CEO Andy Jassy's multi-year, cost-cutting maneuvering padded the bottom line. AWS revenue in the first three months of the year increased by 17%, the fastest clip since 2022.\nJassy used his call with Wall Street analysts to continue to raise expectations about how transformational generative AI technologies will be to Amazon's future financial performance and to AWS clients. Tens of thousands of customers are already using Amazon's cloud-based AI service, known as Bedrock, and Jassy predicted that many more will embrace generative AI as they discover how easily it can be integrated into their products.\n\"Unlike with the cloud where there's a lot of work to be done to move from on-premise [servers] to the cloud,\" Jassy said, \"all of these generative AI...workloads..are going to be built from scratch on the cloud largely.\"\nWhile many AI companies, including Anthropic, currently use AWS services to train the large language models that underpin their products, Amazon executives on Tuesday's earnings call said that the bigger long term business opportunity could come from companies operating their AI models on its cloud, a process called \"inference.\" Jassy said that Gen AI-related business is currently on track to drive multiple billion dollars of AWS revenue this year, and that he believes the AI business boom could last for ten to twenty years as customers embrace the technology.\nAmazon's upfront investments to fulfill longterm AI demand will not be cheap. The company spent more than $48 billion on capital expenditures in 2023, and executives said that number will \"meaningfully increase\" in 2024, though they did not specify by how much. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky did say that the $14 billion Amazon spent in capital expenditures in the first quarter is expected to be the lowest quarterly total for the year.\nWhile some of that spending is going toward Amazon's continued investment in expanding its warehouse footprint and fleet of delivery vans, the primary reason for the step-up is to support AWS' growth and the demand from the generative AI boom.\nAt a higher level, Amazon executives said they believe that AWS clients are largely past the cost-optimization focus of the first couple years of the pandemic and ready to focus on modernizing their tech infrastructure and investing in new areas such as Gen AI.\nInternally, divisions of the company focused on AI products and services are some of the only ones where Amazon employees should expect to see significant hiring, the CFO alluded.\n\"Generally most teams are working hard to keep headcount flat and...automate what we can,\u201d Olsavsky said on a media call with reporters.\nBeyond AWS, Amazon's transformation into as much a services business as a retail business continues to bear fruit. Revenue that Amazon generates from fees it charges its third-party sellers grew 16% to more than $34 billion in the quarter, while advertising revenue rose 24% to nearly $12 billion.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Should You Join Costco if You're Already an Amazon Prime Member?",
        "Author": "  Maurie Backman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "\nFor many people, Amazon Prime's $139 annual fee is more than worth paying. In exchange, you not only get unlimited free two-day shipping, but you also get access to other helpful programs like Try Before You Buy, where you can try on clothing and see if it fits before having your credit card charged. And if you're someone who loves a quiet evening at home, the free content from Prime is apt to make for some nice entertainment.\nIf you're already fitting the cost of a Prime membership into your budget, then you may not be in such a rush to sign up for a Costco membership. Although you'll only pay $60 for a basic annual Costco membership (an Executive membership costs $120 a year), you may feel that you're not going to get the best value out of a Costco membership if you already have Prime. But here's why joining Costco could make a lot of sense.\nAmazon offers a world of products, from electronics to apparel to toys. But one area where you may not benefit so much as a Prime member is fresh groceries.\nGranted, with Amazon, you get access to Amazon Fresh, which gives you access to a wide range of fresh grocery products and even delivery. But Amazon Fresh isn't known for its bulk discounts on groceries the way Costco is. And that's where you might reap a world of savings.\nLet's say you have a larger family and normally spend $600 a month on groceries at a regular supermarket. With Amazon Fresh, you may not save any money. At Costco, you might manage to whittle your monthly grocery bill down to $540 by purchasing so many of the items you use frequently in bulk. That $60 savings could be enough to make you whole on your $60 membership fee -- and come out ahead financially the rest of the year.\nWhile access to fresh food in bulk is a good reason to join Costco even if you're a Prime member, another thing you should know is that Costco offers a world of benefits outside of just food and household products. For one thing, Costco's travel service gives members access to hundreds of competitively priced vacation packages. On Amazon, you might be able to find a great deal on luggage -- but you can't book your upcoming trip through Amazon.\nAlso, Costco stores commonly have an auto center where you can purchase tires and have them installed at no additional cost. You can also get free rotations and flat tire repairs. That's not a service Amazon provides.\nAnd don't forget Costco's affordable gas. Filling up your tank may be a lot less painful if you do it at Costco.\nOf course, your Prime membership might make it so you're doing less shopping in person and therefore aren't filling up your car as much. But still, it's nice to save money for those times when your vehicle does need some fuel.\nFor these reasons, it could easily pay to join Costco and continue paying for Amazon Prime at the same time. And remember, with Costco, you can cancel your membership for a refund at any time. So what you may want to do is sign up and see how things go.\nIn a worst-case scenario, if you find that your Costco membership isn't doing much for you, you can always cancel and just pay for Prime. But you may find that both memberships complement each other nicely, allowing you to save time and money.\nThis credit card is not just good \u2013 it\u2019s so exceptional that our experts use it personally.

        "Author": "  Andrew Lisa ",
        "Text": "According to Forbes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is worth just shy of $200 billion \u2014 more than Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett and the rest of the 12-figure club.\nIf you\u2019re the head of a publicly traded company, you don\u2019t become a perennial contender for the title of the richest person in the world by not keeping shareholders happy \u2014 and Bezos has a horizontal skyscraper for a yacht because he\u2019s spent years turning modest investments into gargantuan gains for investors large and small.\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonTry This: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nAmazon (AMZN) is one of the great success stories of 21st-century capitalism, and it\u2019s hard not to wonder what your net worth would be today if you had socked a thousand bucks into the world\u2019s largest online retailer 10 years ago. You might not like the answer, but read on to find out anyway.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nAmazon stock is currently trading at roughly $172 per share. Around the same time 10 years ago in late April 2014, it was trading at about $16.50.\nAccording to Zacks Equity Research, a $1,000 investment in mid-March 2014 would have been worth $9,565.47 in the middle of last month for a gain of 856.55%. Amazon doesn\u2019t pay a dividend, so you wouldn\u2019t have had an opportunity to collect passive income or reinvest distributions to accelerate your returns.\nSince shares were a little more expensive in March 2014 than they were one month later in April, a $1,000 investment exactly 10 years ago would have increased your money tenfold \u2014 to roughly $10,000.\nBy comparison, the S&P 500 rose just 179.75% and gold gained 50.53% over the same period.\nRead Next: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\nOn June 6, 2022, Amazon issued a 20-to-1 stock split, which means that existing shareholders received 20 shares for every one they held, with the new shares worth one-twentieth of their previous value. It was the fourth such split, with the other three taking place in the late 1990s.\nAmazon shares had been trading at $2,495.80 at the time of the 2022 split, which slashed the price to $124.79 per share.\nThe split had no impact on the value of an investment in the company. It was the equivalent of Amazon giving shareholders 20 $1 bills for a $20 bill. Or, in a neat analogy from Forbes, \u201cCutting one pizza pie into 20 slices doesn\u2019t create more pizza.\u201d\nMany of those who did invest in Amazon in 2014 encountered stormy seas and were likely tempted to cut their losses or, depending on their tax strategy, harvest them several times shortly after anteing up.\nAccording to 24/7 Wall Street, \u201cIf you\u2019d bought in March 2014 you\u2019d have seen shares decline over 20% (multiple times)\u2026 That $1,000 investment wouldn\u2019t have recovered back to the initial value until almost a year later.\u201d\nAnd losses weren\u2019t limited to the year following March 2014. Amazon shareholders endured stomach-churning ups and downs for years. In the fall and winter of 2018, the price dropped from roughly $98 to less than $74. COVID \u2014 and the mass shuttering of physical stores \u2014 was good to Amazon, which zigged and zagged its way up to $179 \u2014 roughly the same as today \u2014 in July 2021 before cratering to $84 in December 2022 and then working its way back up to its current price.\nAmazon has had a strong 2024 so far, starting the year at just under $150 and gaining nearly 20% year to date. According to Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD), the gains were the market\u2019s response to the company\u2019s stellar earnings report from the fourth quarter of 2023. It will release its Q1 2024 report on Tuesday, April 30.\nSo is Amazon still a good buy, and will those who sit on the sidelines today be left wishing they had put money down 10 years from today in April 2034?\nWhile no one can predict the future, IBD reports that Amazon sales are projected to grow by 12% year over year. Furthermore, Amazon\u2019s advertising \u2014 the company\u2019s fastest-growing division \u2014 is expected to grow by 23.5% year over year to $11.74 billion.\nThe outlook is optimistic and it appears very likely that Amazon\u2019s best days are still ahead, with IBD writing, \u201cJefferies analyst Brent Thill recently raised his price target for Amazon stock to 225, from 190, and reiterated a buy rating.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Single Best Thing To Buy at Costco in April 2024\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nThis is One of the Best Ways to Boost Your Retirement Savings in 2024\n7 Things You'll Be Happy You Downgraded in Retirement\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: If You Invested $1,000 in Amazon Stock in 2014, It Would Be Worth This Much Today\n"

(AP) \u2014 Amazon \u2019s cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services plans to invest $11 billion to build a data center in northern Indiana that will create at least 1,000 new jobs, state and company officials announced Thursday.\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb called the project planned near the town of New Carlisle, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of South Bend, \u201cthe largest capital investment announcement in Indiana\u2019s history.\"\n\u201cThis significant investment solidifies Indiana\u2019s leadership position in the economy of the future, and will undoubtedly have a positive ripple effect on the town of New Carlisle, the north central region and the state of Indiana for years to come,\u201d Holcomb said in a news release.\nThe announcement from Holcomb's office and AWS did not include a timeline for the data center campus in northern Indiana's St. Joseph County, which abuts the Michigan state line.\nBut Carl Baxmeyer, president of the St. Joseph County Board of Commissioners, said in the news release that it would be built \u201cover the next decade\u201d at the Indiana Enterprise Center, located just east of New Carlisle, and \u201cwill be a major employment center for all of northern Indiana.\u201d\nThe AWS data center would contain computer servers, data storage drives, networking equipment, \u201cand other forms of technology infrastructure used to power cloud computing capabilities, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies,\u201d according to the news release.\nRoger Wehner, AWS director of economic development, said the Indiana data center \u201cwill create numerous well-paying job opportunities and tap into the state\u2019s burgeoning tech sector, while contributing significantly to the state\u2019s growing economy.\u201d\nBased on the company 's planned investment, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. has committed to providing data center sales tax exemptions \u201cfor eligible capital investments over a 50-year term,\" the release states.\nThe IEDC has also committed to a variety of performance-based tax credits to support the AWS data center plans, including up to $18.3 million in headcount-based tax credits, up to $55 million in Hoosier Business Investment tax credits, and up to $20 million in redevelopment tax credits, the release states.\nAWS will provide up to $7 million to support road infrastructure improvements along State Road 2, surrounding the company\u2019s planned data center, according to the release.\n"

        "Title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Shopify vs. Amazon",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The e-commerce industry has undoubtedly made room for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), but outside these e-commerce ties, the companies have less in common than one might think. Amazon is an online seller with a tech business, while Shopify is more of a software business.\nHence, both companies approach e-commerce from different angles, meaning their investment cases differ significantly. However, after looking at both companies, one should stand out as the more lucrative investment.\nAs mentioned, the most apparent difference in these businesses is that only one of them, Amazon, is an e-retailer. Amazon pioneered e-commerce in the U.S. It started by selling books, but over time, evolved into a retailer that \"sells everything.\"\nWhile it has become the second-largest retailer in the U.S., the company actually earns its income from other businesses. Amazon's primary source of operating income is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing arm. Moreover, even in its retail segments, businesses such as digital advertising, subscriptions, and online seller services are much larger growth drivers than online sales.\nIn contrast, Shopify is not an e-retailer. It developed a fast, highly customizable platform that enables merchants of all sizes to show and sell their products online. It has also ventured into ancillary services such as raising capital, processing payments, and managing inventory for items that sell both online and offline.\nAdditionally, Amazon has existed longer than Shopify. It was founded in 1994, versus 2006 for Shopify. Amazon has capitalized on a longer existence and rapid growth to become a much larger company. As a result, Amazon has risen to a market cap of almost $1.9 trillion, approximately 19 times larger than Shopify's market cap of just under $100 billion.\nDespite its large size, Amazon continues to maintain a relatively rapid growth rate. This is mostly because of the smaller, high-margin businesses under its umbrella, which contrast with the low margins and slower growth rate of its massive online sales business.\nIn 2023, its $575 billion in revenue grew 12% from last year's levels. Retailing and cloud computing suffered a downturn in 2022. However, profitability recovered in 2023, with net income coming in at $30 billion, well above the $2.7 billion loss in 2022.\nA smaller size worked in Shopify's favor, as its $7.1 billion in revenue increased 26% yearly. Nonetheless, its logistics businesses, which it sold last May, weighed on profitability. As a result, it earned just $132 million in net income in 2023, with its Q4 income of $657 million exceeding the yearly total. Shopify lost nearly $3.5 billion in 2022.\nThose struggles may explain why Amazon's stock rose faster than Shopify's over the last 12 months. Still, on a five-year timeline, Shopify far outperformed the e-commerce conglomerate.\nWith that performance, Shopify is a comparatively more expensive stock. It sells at a pricey forward P/E ratio of 73. In contrast, Amazon, which rarely sells at a low multiple, trades at just 42 times forward earnings, a differential that could strengthen the case for Amazon amid the higher returns more recently.\nUltimately, both stocks should beat the market as their technology continues to attract more business. Still, while risk-averse investors might prefer Amazon, investors with some appetite for risk should lean toward Shopify.\nShopify has grown revenue at a faster pace over time, and the decision to sell the logistics business has again made it a profitable company.\nMoreover, even without a logistics arm, Shopify has an ecosystem that will help it attract more merchants and upsell additional services. Now that the company has again turned profitable, the faster revenue growth should translate into larger earnings increases, a factor that should drive the stock price higher at a more rapid pace.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Other executives who communicated via Signal, according to the FTC, include David Zapolsky, Amazon\u2019s top lawyer; Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s retail czar until 2021; and Dave Clark, a longtime logistics executive who left in 2022 after Bezos handed the reins to Jassy.\nThe FTC\u2019s court filing expands on allegations the agency first made in its antitrust complaint last fall against the company.\n\u201cThe FTC\u2019s contentions are baseless,\u201d said company spokesman Tim Doyle. \u201cAmazon voluntarily disclosed employees\u2019 limited Signal use to the FTC years ago, thoroughly collected Signal conversations from its employees\u2019 phones, and allowed agency staff to inspect those conversations even when they had nothing to do with the FTC\u2019s investigation.\u201d\nExecutives used the encrypted communications app after Bezos disclosed in 2019 that his phone had been hacked and alleged the National Enquirer tabloid sought to publish his intimate photos and texts.\nThe court filing seeks information about what Amazon executives conveyed to employees about when to communicate via Signal and its instructions on retaining messages.\nThe FTC needs the information \u201cto assess whether Amazon failed to take reasonable steps to preserve documents and to map out what information has been destroyed,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s filing.\nThe investigation into Amazon opened by the agency in 2019 required the company to retain and turn over documents. By using Signal\u2019s disappearing messages function, executives interfered with the FTC\u2019s ability to investigate Amazon\u2019s business conduct and potential antitrust violations, the agency said.\n\u201cThe FTC has a complete picture of Amazon\u2019s decision-making in this case including 1.7 million documents from sources like email, internal messaging applications, and laptops (among other sources), and over 100 terabytes of data,\u201d Doyle said.\nUS antitrust enforcers have also accused Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google of destroying evidence by failing to retain internal communications despite multiple investigations into the company that required them to preserve documents. The Justice Department alleged that Google encouraged employees to have sensitive conversations over chat with the history function turned off, meaning the conversation would be automatically deleted after 24 hours.\nA California federal judge found Google \u201cadopted a \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy for chat preservation\u201d and reprimanded the company\u2019s top lawyer over the data preservation protocol.\nThe Justice Department has sought sanctions against the company over the issue, though a different federal judge has yet to rule on the request.\nThe FTC could refer any wrongdoing it uncovers to the Justice Department if it discovers anyone deliberately destroyed evidence.\n--With assistance from Matt Day and Spencer Soper.\n(Updates with excerpt from court filing in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy\nAI Is Helping Automate One of the World\u2019s Most Gruesome Jobs\nTesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes\nElon Musk vs. Jeff Bezos Is America\u2019s New Moon Race\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "The launch of Prime Video\u2019s ad-supported tier in January helped boost Amazon\u2019s overall advertising services revenue for the first quarter of 2024 by 24% to $11.8 billion.\nMeanwhile, subscription services revenue, which includes annual and monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships, as well as digital video, audiobook, digital music, e-book, and other non-AWS subscription services, climbed 11% year over year to $10.7 billion.\nOther revenue, which includes sales related to various other offerings, such as certain licensing and distribution of video content, health care services, shipping services and co-branded credit card agreements, grew 23% year over year to $1.26 billion.\nHere are Amazon\u2019s top-line results for the quarter:\nNet income: $10.4 billion, more than triple the $3.2 billion in the prior-year period.\nEarnings Per Share: 98 cents per share, compared to the 82 cents per share expected by analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\nNet Sales: $143.3 billion, up 13% year over year, compared to $142.53 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\nAd Revenue: $11.8 billion, up 24% from $9.5 billion in Q1 of 2023\n\u201cIt was a good start to the year across the business, and you can see that in both our customer experience improvements and financial results,\u201d Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s very early days in all of our businesses and we remain excited by how much more we can make customers\u2019 lives better and easier moving forward.\u201d\nIn Amazon\u2019s annual shareholder letter in April, Jassy said that streaming advertising was \u201coff to a strong start\u201d and \u201cgrowing quickly,\u201d noting that brands can reach over 200 million monthly viewers.\n\u201cI think advertisers are excited about being able to expand their ability to advertise with us on video beyond Twitch and Freevee to Prime Video shows and movies,\u201d Jassy told analysts during the company\u2019s first quarter earnings call. \u201cI think they also find that the relevancy and the measurability of that type of advertising in Prime Video ads is unique for them.\u201d\nPrime Video\u2019s ad tier is the default for all subscribers. Those who want an ad-free streaming experience will be charged an additional $2.99 per month. Currently, Amazon Prime, which includes Prime Video, costs $14.99 per month or $139 a year. A membership that only includes Prime Video and none of the company\u2019s shipping benefits costs $8.99 a month.\nDuring the quarter, Prime Video released 20 films and series from Amazon MGM Studios.

Beauty (ELF) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $190, down from $220. The firm sees the potential for e.l.f. to double its business by fiscal 2027 with shelf space and international expansion as the driving forces.\nHSBC upgraded Danaher (DHR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $280, up from $250. HSBC's supply chain analysis suggests the de-stocking effects as well as order books might be on a recovery path for the life sciences tools sector.\nWells Fargo upgraded Omnicom (OMC) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $106, up from $91. The firm sees upside to the company's organic growth from new business, media trends and \"Flywheel.\"\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Antero Resources (AR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $36, up from $26. The firm sees the company providing attractive leverage to rising gas prices and leading exposure to the growing liquified natural fairway in the Gulf Coast.\nGuggenheim upgraded Group 1 Automotive (GPI) to Buy from Neutral with a $305 price target, calling it the \"best positioned dealer\" to navigate the current landscape, which is \"somehow trading at [the] lowest multiple.\"\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nNorthcoast downgraded Boeing (BA) to Sell from Neutral with a $140 price target. The firm expects Boeing's quarterly earnings report in two weeks to prompt concerns about the company's underlying fundamentals and ultimately shift investor focus to liquidity and acquisition concerns.\nJPMorgan downgraded Fortive (FTV) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $90, down from $95. The firm also removed the shares from its Analyst Focus List. The company's Precision Technologies order trends have remained sluggish so far this year, with sales likely down through the first half of 2024 despite support from an excess backlog that is close to being exhausted, JPMorgan says.\nJefferies downgraded Urban Outfitters (URBN) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $32, down from $42. The firm's latest data shows a \"notable deceleration\" in rolling three-month foot traffic to all three of Urban's brands.\nWells Fargo downgraded EQT Corporation (EQT) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $37, down from $48. The firm acknowledges that the recently announced merger with Equitrans Midstream (ETRN) should position the company as a unique \"Gas E&P + Midstream\" entity, resembling a mini super-major, but says it is clear the E&P and midstream investor communities will take some time to embrace this integrated model, versus the prevailing preference for pure-play narratives.\nPiper Sandler downgraded Marsh McLennan (MMC) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $211. The shares are now \"reasonably valued\" and there is not much in the way of future catalysts that will change that, the firm says.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nMaxim initiated coverage of Amazon.com (AMZN) with a Buy rating and $218 price target. The firm believes the company will be able to exploit consumer internet trends that include advertising, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, healthcare, logistics, and over-the-top, or OTT, video.\nMaxim initiated coverage of Apple (AAPL) with a Hold rating and $178 price target. Apple is too dependent on China, from a sales and supply-chain standpoint, and it is overweight a single product, the iPhone, when it comes to its near-term operating results, the firm says.\nMaxim initiated coverage of Beyond (BYND) with a Buy rating and $50 price target. The firm contends that the company will be able to exploit the Consumer Internet trends of 2024 that include international expansion as well as Blockchain and Mobile opportunities.\nRaymond James initiated coverage of GE Vernova (GEV) with an Outperform rating and $160 price target.\u00a0 The firm looks at Vernova as a mid-single-digit growth story, with power lagging behind wind and electrification.\nMizuho initiated coverage of Royal Caribbean (RCL) with a Buy rating and $164 price target. Royal has a unique mix of quality ship assets, as well as differentiated destinations, the combination of which drives upside potential to estimates, says the firm.\n"

        "Title": "Why Should You Buy Amazon ETFs Ahead of Q1 Earnings?",
        "Author": "  Sweta Killa ",
        "Text": "Amazon AMZN is set to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30, after market close. Being a market leader in e-commerce, it is worth taking a look at the company\u2019s fundamentals ahead of its results (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).Amazon has risen 4.5% over the past three months, outperforming the industry, which saw a decline of 1.2%. The outperformance is expected to continue, given that the online behemoth has an increased chance of beating estimates in its quarterly report. It saw positive earnings revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat.Given this, investors could tap this opportune moment through ETFs with a substantial allocation to this online behemoth. These include ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS, Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY and VanEck Vectors Retail ETF RTH.\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +7.51% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our surprise prediction methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny in the past seven days for the first quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate implies massive year-over-year earnings growth of 161.3% and substantial revenue growth of 11.9% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with a surprise of 51.04%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock has a solid VGM Score of A and falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 13%).Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. Of the 46 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 91.3% and 6.52% of all recommendations.Based on short-term price targets offered by 43 analysts, the average price target for Amazon comes to $208.86. The forecasts range from a low of $140.00 to a high of $235.00.\nAmazon's growth story hinges on its robust retail business, its strong cloud division, growing investments in generative AI, its solid advertising business and expanding streaming services.The new CEO, Andy Jassy, forecasts that the company will get a boost from strategic cost cuts, cloud-computing demand and the growth of artificial intelligence. In his annual letter to shareholders, Jassy highlighted the tech giant's approach to generative AI, which he described as Amazon's next potential pillar of growth, following its e-commerce marketplace, Prime subscription service and Amazon Web Services cloud-computing business. \"Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet,\" Jassy wrote.Amazon's strategic plans for growth are also highlighted by its possible entry into the grocery sector and its focus on \"primitives\" to drive innovation. In the near future, legal issues could present hurdles but advancements in AI have the potential to transform multiple industries, offering both challenges and prospects (read: 5 ETFs to Tap Amazon's Growth Story).Given the bullishness in AI transformation and the leadership transition to Andy Jassy, Amazon hit a new all-time high in almost three years in the Apr 11 trading session, reflecting a dramatic rebound from its slump in 2022 and the resurgence of confidence in Amazon\u2019s future growth potential. Further, Amazon joined the blue-chip index Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of February, which underscores its strong business growth potential.In its last earnings release, the world's largest online retailer expected revenues to be in the range of $138-$143.5 billion for the first quarter of 2024, implying year-over-year growth of 8%-13%.\nProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN)ProShares Online Retail ETF offers exposure to companies that principally sell online or through other non-store channels and then zeros in on the companies that reshape the retail space.

Most of those cuts are related to business changes in AWS training and certification programs as well as sales operations. The tech giant said it was also making cuts elsewhere so it can invest in other business priorities.\n\u201cThese decisions are difficult but necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Duncan Neasham said in a statement.\nThe AWS layoffs follow other layoffs that happened at Amazon and its subsidiaries this year. In January, the company cut several hundred positions across its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit. That same month, Twitch, the popular social media platform owned by Amazon, laid off more than 500 jobs in a bid to save on costs. The online audiobook and podcast service Audible also laid off about 5% of its workforce.\nAmazon says it will continue to hire in priority areas.

        "Title": "Selling profitably on Amazon becomes even harder",
        "Author": "  Michael Baudendistel ",
        "Text": "Amazon imposes inventory-placement fees and low-inventory fees\n(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\nFor anyone involved with selling through Amazon, I recommend going through the latest newsletter published by Cartograph, a company that helps brands sell profitably on Amazon. I interviewed Chris Moe, Cartograph\u2019s CEO, on past The Stockout shows. Those discussions impressed upon me that brands must understand, and play by, Amazon\u2019s numerous and frequently changing rules in order to sell profitably through the online giant. Now, Amazon is changing its policies for inventory placement within its fulfillment centers while also adding low-inventory fees. Both of these changes to fees seem to more heavily penalize smaller brands that are more likely to use smaller shipments and those that sell lower-value items, including CPG items.\nInventory-placement fees potentially punitive to LTL shipments:\nWhat stood out to me in Cartograph\u2019s writeup is the dramatic changes to potential fees associated with LTL shipments, which, in some cases, could rise from the low to mid-$100s to $2,000 or more per shipment. That could encourage some brands to consolidate LTL shipments into larger truckload shipments, but, according to Cartograph, that\u2019s not necessarily better because Amazon will still rebalance inventory between warehouses at brands\u2019 expense.\nLow-inventory fees to impose explicit cost on de-prioritizing Amazon as an inventory channel:\nNew fees will be imposed for having less than 28 days of inventory, calculated weekly as average days of supply over 30- and 90-day periods. When both averages (30 and 90 days) fall below 28 days of inventory, there is a fee that ranges from 30 cents to $1 per item shipped (fees escalate at lower inventory levels). Since it\u2019s calculated at the product level (which Amazon calls the Amazon Standard Identification Number), some varieties of a product can be out of stock without the brand incurring a fee. Since the fees are calculated weekly, Cartograph recommends moving products in and out of Amazon warehouses weekly. Another strategy is to reduce advertising and promotional spending when inventory levels decline to low levels.\nUse Shein\u2019s supply chain at your own risk\n(Image: FWTV)\nOn Monday\u2019s The Stockout show, Grace Sharkey and I discussed the impact of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, Shein\u2019s opening of its supply chain to outside designers, Home Depot\u2019s acquisition and the current freight market.\nThe focus of the show was on last week\u2019s announcement that controversial fast fashion online retailer Shein plans to launch a supply chain as a service offering. That would enable outside brand designers and manufacturers to tap into Shein\u2019s supply chain infrastructure and technology, which uses real-time data to inform small-batch production schedules. Leveraging Shein\u2019s supply chain could enable brands to test new designs efficiently without the need for large capital investments. The risk of using the company\u2019s supply chain as a service is that outside brands could become entangled in the same controversies, which include suspicions of the use of forced labor in China, the circumvention of import duties, intellectual property infringement and environmental concerns.\nSee Monday\u2019s episode here or see the full The Stockout playlist here.\nInternational intermodal outshines domestic intermodal in Q1\nSONAR Tickers: ORAILINTL.USA Seasonality, ORAILDOML.USA Seasonality\nMost public intermodal volume data sets conflate international and domestic intermodal volume, which should be treated as separate segments, as SONAR does. In Q1 2024, international intermodal was responsible for most of the intermodal volume growth. Specifically, in Q1, loaded international intermodal volume was up 20.9% year over year, while loaded containerized domestic intermodal volume was up 2.2%. Meanwhile, the more widely seen containerized intermodal volume data published by the Association of American Railroads was up 11.3% through March 23. That number includes both domestic and international volume as well as empty containers that are being repositioned (known as revenue-empties). SONAR data shows that revenue empties were up 28.8% year over year in the first quarter, primarily as a result of international containers being repositioned back to the port.\nContainership lines are only willing to send international intermodal volume inland in large quantities when there are plenty of oceangoing containers available, as there appear to have been in the first quarter. In addition, it\u2019s important for investment analysts to base their Q1 expectations for the domestic intermodal companies (e.g., J.B. Hunt, Hub Group and Schneider) off the domestic intermodal volume rather than a figure that combines segments. The breakdown is also important for domestic intermodal shippers, who should base their expectations for available capacity off the more modest year-to-date domestic intermodal volume growth.\nTo subscribe to The Stockout, FreightWaves\u2019 CPG and retail newsletter, click here.\nThe post Selling profitably on Amazon becomes even harder appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is best known as the king of e-commerce, accounting for more than a third of all U.S. e-commerce sales, a staggering lead. As for Amazon's own business, e-commerce accounts for about 67% of total sales. Online store sales increased 9% year over year in the 2023 fourth quarter, and third-party sales rose 20%.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's second-largest segment, accounting for 14% of the total, and AWS sales increased 13% year over year in the fourth quarter. But advertising has emerged as Amazon's third-largest segment, and it's also its fastest growing. Let's consider its potential and what it could mean for investors.\nAt $14 billion, advertising accounts for around 8% of sales. But ad sales increased 27% year over year in the fourth quarter, and it's been the fastest-growing segment for several quarters. Amazon only began to report it as a separate segment at the end of 2021.\nWith the advent of artificial intelligence as a major force in business, advertising is undergoing a remarkable transformation, paving the way for substantial growth. And experts expect this growth to continue over the next few years, as the chart below suggests.\nAmazon has several advantages in advertising. It has powerful AI capabilities that help advertisers find the right audience with pinpoint accuracy, and since hundreds of millions of shoppers are already on Amazon's website looking for products advertisers offer, it's the perfect spot for exposure. The largest ad categories per the chart, TV and video advertising and search advertising, are in Amazon's wheelhouse.\nThe company recently launched sponsored TV ads in the U.S. to open up the opportunity to smaller businesses that don't have large budgets and expand its own opportunities. Management said sales increases for some of its football streaming has been \"dramatic,\" and it's still just getting started with developing full ad capabilities. Even better, advertising is a high-margin business that's helping pad the bottom line.\nExpect advertising to drive high growth at Amazon for the foreseeable future.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Wall Street analysts forecast that Amazon (AMZN) will report quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its upcoming release, pointing to a year-over-year increase of 164.5%. It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $142.53 billion, exhibiting an increase of 11.9% compared to the year-ago quarter.\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 1.6% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Amazon metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\nAnalysts forecast 'Net Sales- AWS' to reach $24.26 billion. The estimate points to a change of +13.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net sales- Physical stores' should arrive at $5.06 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Net sales- Online stores' at $54.76 billion. The estimate points to a change of +7.2% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net Sales- Subscription services' will reach $10.68 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- North America' stands at $85.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +11% from the prior-year quarter.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net Sales- Advertising services' of $11.87 billion. The estimate points to a change of +24.8% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue - International' will likely reach $32.74 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +12.4% year over year.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Third-party seller services' should come in at $34.48 billion. The estimate points to a change of +15.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Subscription services Y/Y Change' will reach 10.8%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 15%.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Third-party seller services Y/Y Change' will reach 15.6%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 18%.\nAnalysts expect 'Headcount - Total' to come in at 1,496,412. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 1,465,000 in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'WW shipping costs' reaching $21.69 billion. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $19.94 billion.View all Key Company Metrics for Amazon here>>>Over the past month, Amazon shares have recorded returns of -1.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3% change.

        "Title": "The Art of Valuation: Discovering Amazon.com Inc's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-04-15, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $62.04. It's currently trading at a price of $186.16. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -200.06%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$2.81\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n16.57\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n7.05\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n62.04\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $38.50. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -383.53%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Brazil's plans to drill for oil in the Amazon hit stiff Indigenous resistance",
        "Author": "  Marta Nogueira and Fabio Teixeira ",
        "Text": "By Marta Nogueira and Fabio Teixeira\nOIAPOQUE, Brazil (Reuters) - State-run energy firm Petrobras has hit growing resistance from Indigenous groups and government agencies to its premier exploration project, which would open the most promising part of Brazil's northern coast to oil drilling.\nEnvironmental agency Ibama denied Petrobras a license for exploratory drilling offshore in the Foz do Amazonas area last year, citing possible impacts on Indigenous groups and the sensitive coastal biome. But a Petrobras appeal for Ibama to reverse its decision has drawn powerful political backing.\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in September that Brazil should be able to \u201cresearch\u201d the region\u2019s potential resources, given the national interest. Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira last week told journalists that it is \u201cBrazil's right to know the potential\u201d of the offshore fields.\nThat has bolstered bullish rhetoric from Petrobras about its chances of getting a license to drill in the blocks off the coast of Amapa state.\n\"Get ready Amapa, because we are arriving,\" Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates told local politicians and oil executives at an event last month promoting offshore exploration along the northern coast in an area known as Equatorial Margin. He called it \"perhaps the last frontier of the oil era for Brazil.\"\nHe has said he expects to start drilling in the second half of this year or sooner in the most promising part of the Equatorial Margin, named the Foz do Amazonas basin, for the mouth of the Amazon River several hundred kilometers away. Foz de Amazonas shares geology with the coast of nearby Guyana, where Exxon is developing huge fields.\nIbama chief Rodrigo Agostinho said in November that a decision would be made in early 2024, although labor disputes at the agency have since slowed the pace of environmental licensing.\nVisits to four Indigenous villages, interviews with over a dozen local leaders, and previously unreported documents show organized opposition mounting to Petrobras' attempt to reverse the halt on exploratory drilling.\nPetrobras has drawn fresh government scrutiny. Indigenous affairs agency Funai asked Ibama regulators in December to run several more studies to assess impacts, according to a Dec. 11 government memo from Funai to Ibama obtained in a freedom of information request. The proposed studies would have to be done before Ibama can decide whether to accept the Petrobras appeal.\nIn July 2022, the Council of Chieftains of the Indigenous People of Oiapoque (CCPIO), an umbrella group representing more than 60 Indigenous villages in the area, asked federal prosecutors to get involved, denouncing an alleged violation of their rights.\nBrazilian prosecutors have a mandate to protect Indigenous peoples, often taking their side in disputes with firms or federal and state governments. In September 2022 they recommended that Ibama not issue the license before a formal consultation of the local communities. Records from the prosecutors\u2019 preliminary investigation, seen by Reuters, show that in December 2023, CCPIO asked them to broker a 13-month formal consultation with Petrobras about Indigenous views on the project.\nThe consultation process, along with studies proposed by Funai, would push a decision into 2025 when Brazil will host the COP30 climate change summit in the Amazon city of Belem, which could make it more politically difficult to approve drilling, a person close to CCPIO told Reuters.\nMinutes from a June 2023 meeting between Petrobras, CCPIO leaders and prosecutors show the company offered to consult local communities about eventual commercial oil production in the area, if Ibama requests it, but did not commit to a consultation before drilling exploratory wells.\nAsked about Indigenous leaders' calls for immediate consultations, Petrobras told Reuters in a statement that the time for such requests has passed.\n\u201cThe definition of whether or not it is necessary to consult indigenous peoples and/or traditional communities takes place at the initial stage of the environmental licensing process,\u201d Petrobras said.\nIbama has not yet replied to the recommendation by Indigenous affairs agency Funai late last year for more assessments of the effects of Petrobras' exploration plans, according to an April 3 Funai document seen by Reuters.\nBoth agencies did not reply to requests for comment by Reuters. CCPIO and prosecutors said a consultation must be made before Ibama issues a license to drill.\nFAULT LINES The drilling standoff has created a fault line in Lula\u2019s government, which is balancing his vows to protect the Amazon and its Indigenous people with the interests of Petrobras and political allies that stand to reap the benefits of a new oil-producing region.\nSilveira, the energy minister, has said that a single Foz de Amazonas block off the coast of Amapa state could yield more than 5.6 billion barrels of oil, which would be the company's biggest discovery in over a decade.\nIn its appeal to Ibama, the company said that exploration will have no negative impact on local communities.\n\u201cWe ratify the understanding that there is no direct impact of the temporary activity of drilling a well 175 km from the coast on Indigenous communities,\u201d Petrobras said.\nLocal people and some environmentalists warn that drilling could threaten coastal mangroves and vast wetlands rich with fish and plant life, while disrupting the lives of the 8,000 Indigenous people in Oiapoque, on Brazil's far northern coast.\nThe CCPIO, the highest Indigenous authority in Oiapoque, is composed of more than 60 caciques, or chieftains, representing over 8,000 people. They do not oppose the search for oil per se, but invoke what they say is a right to prior consultation by Petrobras, with supervision from the federal prosecutors\u2019 office and Funai.\nThe International Labor Organization convention 169, which Brazil signed, says that governments must consult Indigenous and tribal peoples through their representative institutions, whenever considering legislative or administrative measures that may affect them directly.\nCHANGE AFOOT\nThe plans to drill are already changing Oiapoque. Waves of migrant workers have arrived looking for jobs in an oil industry that does not yet exist, state lawmaker Inacio Monteiro said.\nMonteiro said he meets often with Indigenous constituents, talking to them about the benefits that Petrobras could bring to Oiapoque, including jobs, tax revenue and social programs.\nYet CCPIO and its allies have become increasingly vocal with their resistance as Petrobras garners support for its appeal, including at the COP28 climate summit in December, where Luene Karipuna told a panel that Petrobras and local politicians had tried to silence her people.\n\"Strategically, this prior consultation is our only safety net,\" 25-year-old Karipuna, who is studying to be a teacher, said near her home in the Santa Izabel village, where marshes fill with seawater at certain times of the year.\nWhen the rivers run low, tides bring in saltwater fish the villagers eat, but some interviewed by Reuters fear it could just as easily bring oil spills.\nPOLITICAL PRESSURE\nIndigenous leaders said a full-court press from local politicians in support of Petrobras was on display at a May 2023 public hearing that Monteiro, the state lawmaker, called just days after Petrobras' license was denied.\nAmapa's political powerbrokers, including key Lula allies, rallied within days at Oiapoque's town hall for the hearing to promote Petrobras' plans to drill.\nAt the event, one man in a white polo shirt and a feathered headdress, Ramon Karipuna told the crowd that Indigenous people were in favor of drilling, according to minutes of the meeting seen by Reuters.\nKaripuna said he spoke for the coordinator of the CCPIO council of chieftains, who was absent for \"health reasons.\"\nPetrobras later cited Karipuna's endorsement in its appeal of the denied drilling license and described him as a \"CCPIO representative.\"\nHowever, CCPIO coordinator Cacique Edmilson Oliveira told Reuters he was not sick that day. CCPIO had refused to take part in the hastily summoned event, according to a May 18 letter sent in response to Monteiro\u2019s invitation to the hearing and seen by Reuters.\n\"This is very concerning. That's why we are saying that we already feel threatened,\" Oliveira said, accusing Petrobras of distorting the views of Indigenous leaders. \"We never sat down and reached an agreement for approval.\"\nIn a telephone interview, Karipuna confirmed he worked at the town hall and that he is not a member of CCPIO \u2013 even though Petrobras used his words as its main argument to Ibama that Indigenous representatives supported drilling. He also backed away from his comments in favor of drilling.\n\"To this day many people have doubts about this Petrobras business,\u201d he said.\nAsked about its mischaracterization of Karipuna, Petrobras cited the minutes of the May 2023 meeting, without elaborating.\n(Reporting by Marta Nogueira in Oiapoque and Fabio Teixeira in Rio de Janeiro; Editing by Brad Haynes and Alistair Bell)\n"

        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s AMZN share price reached an all-time high of $187.29 during the intraday trading on Monday, surpassing its record closing price of $186.57 in July 2021, which was marked the highest in the pandemic-led booming era for internet and e-commerce stocks. It was the first time the stock soared this high in the post-pandemic period. Moreover, the e-commerce and cloud giant\u2019s market capitalization is moving closer to $2 trillion, which is noteworthy ahead of its first-quarter 2024 earnings.The surge reflects investor confidence in Amazon's robust retail business, strengthening cloud division, growing investments in generative AI, solid advertising business, and expanding streaming services.AMZN has gained 21.8% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s rally of 9.5%, and the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry\u2019s and Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s returns of 11.6% and 8.8%.However, the looming question remains \u2014 can Amazon sustain this momentum?\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nThe company\u2019s cloud computing arm, AWS, dominates the cloud market on the back of its robust portfolio. In this regard, AWS\u2019s growing efforts to power its cloud services with generative AI remain noteworthy.AWS offers Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.The company\u2019s recent collaboration with NVIDIA NVDA through which it will make the latter\u2019s NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, remains a plus. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.Further, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs. AWS also intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU.Growing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market. Per an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.In addition to generative AI efforts, AWS\u2019s expanding data center network, and an increasing number of AWS Regions and Availability Zones are expected to continue aiding it in offering low latency and access to its robust cloud portfolio, including AI, machine learning, data analytics and the Internet of Things to the customers seamlessly. This, in turn, will drive its customer momentum.Currently, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions. It further plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s aggressive expansion efforts are expected to continue aiding its competitive prowess against its strong peers, such as Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google. Both companies are leaving no stone unturned to boost their presence in the promising cloud market.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Microsoft Azure became the key driver for MSFT. Microsoft Azure's increasing number of availability zones and regions across the globe, and its growing efforts to integrate generative AI into the cloud are likely to continue driving the company's cloud momentum in the near term.Azure is operating in more than 60 cloud regions at present.Similarly, Google Cloud contributes substantially to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones, increasing generative AI investments and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position.Looking across the world, the total number of Google Cloud regions is currently 39, with 118 zones and 187 network edge locations.\nAmazon\u2019s solid Prime momentum, along with its strengthening distribution network, is continuously benefiting its online retail business. Prime benefits, including a strong loyalty system, customer-friendly offers, quick grocery delivery services and robust Prime Free One-Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery services, are driving the company\u2019s customer momentum.Apart from this, strengthening relationships with third-party sellers remains a major positive for its e-commerce business.The company\u2019s concerted efforts to bolster its online pharma business on the back of expanding same-day medication delivery service and strategic partnerships remain noteworthy.AMZN\u2019s growing grocery retail business, on the back of solid momentum across its Fresh grocery stores and a solid network of Whole Foods Store across the United States, is a plus.All these factors are expected to aid Amazon in sustaining its dominance in the online retail space, as well as expanding its footprint in the offline retail market.Coming to the streaming space, growing momentum in Prime Video on the back of expanding original content, regional content and the sports content portfolio, is constantly driving the Prime subscription of the company.We note that retail perks associated with Prime, along with strength in Prime Video, are likely to continue driving growth in Amazon\u2019s subscription revenues in the days ahead.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They always have. We regularly review our pay to ensure we offer competitive wages and benefits.\"\nThe company employs 75,000 people in the UK, making it one of the country's top ten private sector employers.\n(Reporting by Sarah Young; editing by William James and Sachin Ravikumar)\n"

        "Text": "Amazon on Tuesday debuted a new grocery delivery program for Prime members across the U.S., as well as a lower-cost option for people who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, the official name for the food-stamp program.\nThe cost of unlimited grocery delivery from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh and other local grocers and specialty retailers is $9.99 a month, for orders over $35. The new delivery service is available in more than 3,500 cities and towns across the nation, and includes features such as one-hour delivery windows, Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0Tuesday.\nAmazon said the cost for people who receive SNAP benefits is $4.99 per month. Food-stamp recipients need to have a registered Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, but don't require a Prime membership to join the food delivery program. Prime costs $139 annually, or $14.99 per month.\nThe new service comes almost three years after Amazon ended free delivery for its Whole Foods customers, a decision that sparked some annoyance from customers at the time, the Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, rival Walmart offers unlimited grocery delivery as part of its Walmart Plus membership program, which costs $12.95 per month, along with a discounted service for food stamp recipients.\nOther companies, like Instacart, charge fees that can start at $3.99 per delivery. Amazon said its new grocery delivery service \"pays for itself\" after one delivery per month.\n\"We have many different customers with many different needs, and we want to save them time and money every time they shop for groceries,\" said Tony Hoggett, senior vice president of worldwide grocery stores at Amazon, in a statement.\nAmazon said it is rolling out the program nationally after piloting it in three cities last year. More than 85% of trial participants deemed it a success, according to the company, citing convenience and saving money on delivery fees.\nIncluding food stamp customers in the program is part of Amazon's initiative to help provide affordable grocery services to low-income customers, the company added.\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo: The 60 Minutes Interview\n\"Blind trust\": Widow's $1.5 million romance scam story serves as cautionary tale\nNumber of U.S. measles cases continues to rise\n"

        "Title": "Investors Could Be Concerned With Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Returns On Capital",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.10 = US$37b \u00f7 (US$528b - US$165b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\nSo, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 10%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Multiline Retail industry.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com  for free.\nIn terms of Amazon.com's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 10%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\nOn a side note, Amazon.com has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 31% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.\nIn summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Amazon.com is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. Furthermore the stock has climbed 84% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.\nIf you're still interested in Amazon.com it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation for AMZN  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.\nWhile Amazon.com isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "In just under a week, e-commerce megastar Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is scheduled to report its Q1 2024 financial results. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting earnings will nearly triple year over year, to $0.85 per share. But beyond just next week's results, what are the experts saying about Amazon stock?\nOne analyst in particular, BMO Capital's Brian Pitz, just predicted that within a year, Amazon stock will rise 20% in price, hitting $215 a share.\nHe may be right about that. Amazon, as you probably know, is involved in a lot of different businesses. But at the risk of oversimplification, Amazon's two most important businesses are just two: e-commerce, where Amazon collects most of its revenue; and the cloud computing AWS business, where Amazon makes most of its profit.\nLast year, Amazon's North American and International retail e-commerce businesses raked in a collective $484 billion in revenue, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence -- but actually earned less than $15 billion in profit on that revenue. In contrast, Amazon's much smaller AWS business did a little over $90 billion in sales, but earned profits of just under $25 billion. That's an operating profit margin of 27%.\nWhy is this important? Heading into earnings day, BMO's Pitz predicts that Amazon's e-commerce business will grow its sales by double digits, helping to unlock \"meaningful\" free cash flow. That's great, but what's even better is that Pitz sees Amazon's AWS growing not the 14% year over year that he previously predicted, but 15%.\nAnd sure, a 1-percentage-point change in growth rate might not sound like much. But the faster AWS grows its sales (at 27% profit margins versus the 3% margins at the retail business), the better the future will look for Amazon.com stock. It's really as simple as that.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "After Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL\u00a0exhilarating quarterly results last week, Wall Street will be eying its big tech peer and cloud computing rival Amazon\u2019s AMZN\u00a0Q1 report on Tuesday, April 30.\nMore so than Alphabet, Amazon\u2019s stock has been on an ascending course to hit $200 a share after their 20-for-1 stock splits in 2022 and investors may be wondering if it's time to buy as earnings approach. \u00a0\nQ1 Preview \nAmazon\u2019s Q1 earnings are thought to come in at $0.81 per share which would be a 161% increase from $0.31 a share in the comparative quarter. On the top line, Q1 sales are projected to rise 12% to $142.55 billion.\nNotably, Amazon has exceeded the Zacks EPS Consensus for five consecutive quarters and has posted an impressive average earnings surprise of 51.04% in its last four quarterly reports. Furthermore, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates Amazon could exceed earnings expectations again with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q1 EPS at $0.87 and 7% above the Zacks Consensus.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCloud Expansion\nOutside of its commanding e-commerce business, Amazon\u2019s AWS still controls the primary share of the domestic cloud computing market ahead of Microsoft\u2019s MSFT\u00a0Azure and Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud. According to Zacks estimates, AWS segment sales are expected to rise 13% to $24.25 billion versus $21.35 billion in Q1 2023.\nEdging Towards $200 a Share\nAmazon\u2019s stock has risen +19% this year with a current stock price of $180 a share and has matched Alphabet\u2019s YTD performance with GOOGL having a current price of $166. Over the last year, AMZN has now soared +77% to slightly top GOOGL at +55%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nThe catalyst for Amazon\u2019s stock edging closer to $200 a share has been the positive trend of earnings estimate revisions. Over the last 60 days, fiscal 2024 and FY25 EPS estimates have now risen 1% and 2% respectively, and are slightly up in the last week.\nEven better, Amazon\u2019s annual earnings are currently projected to rise 42% this year to $4.12 per share with another 31% EPS growth expected in FY25.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTakeaway\nAmazon\u2019s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). To that point, the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions ahead of its Q1 report is compelling along with the Zack ESP suggesting the Magnificent Seven titan should top bottom line expectations.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "MELI Stock: Move Over, Amazon. Meet Latin America\u2019s E-Commerce Darling.",
        "Author": "  David Moadel ",
        "Text": "Looking for the \u201cnext\u201d Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock? Look no further, as MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) could be considered the \u201cAmazon of Latin America.\u201d MercadoLibre stock isn\u2019t cheap, by any means, but it has all the markings of a long-term wealth builder.\nLike Amazon, MercadoLibre operates a widely used e-commerce platform. However, MercadoLibre also runs a fintech-services platform called MercadoPago.\nLatin America has a population of over 650 million people. An emerging middle class and increasing Internet penetration make Latin America fertile ground for e-commerce opportunities. So, even if you missed out on the multi-year rally in Amazon stock, you can seize a moneymaking moment with MercadoLibre stock.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nI\u2019m not going to claim that MercadoLibre stock is cheap. The share price recently hit $1,500. Furthermore, MercadoLibre\u2019s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is elevated, at 77.14x.\nValue-focused investors might bristle at MercadoLibre\u2019s high multiple. On the other hand, sometimes a company\u2019s sales growth can justify its lofty P/E ratio. After all, Amazon has been richly valued for a long time, yet the stock has made a lot of money for some people.\nImpressively, MercadoLibre managed to increase its fourth-quarter 2023 net revenue by 42% year over year to $4.26 billion, thereby beating Wall Street\u2019s call for $4.12 billion. Notably, Mercado Pago, MercadoLibre\u2019s fintech division, posted 34% net-revenue growth.\nSo, don\u2019t be surprised if MercadoLibre\u2019s investors continue to grow their wealth despite the high share price. JPMorgan analysts raised their MercadoLibre stock price target from $2,000 to $2,150, and that\u2019s not unrealistic at all, given the company\u2019s sales acceleration.\nWhen a company\u2019s revenue grows rapidly, this enables strategic investment opportunities. In MercadoLibre\u2019s case, the company is pouring large amounts of investable capital into Latin America.\nThe numbers, I\u2019ll admit, are jaw-dropping. This year, MercadoLibre plans to invest $380 million in Colombia, $2.45 billion in Mexico and $4.6 billion in Brazil.\nWhy would MercadoLibre move so much capital into Brazil? According to Reuters, MercadoLibre \u201cgenerates more than half of its revenue in Brazil.\u201d Hence, this particular investment makes sense, though $4.6 billion is still a lot of money.\nThe company intends to allocate capital toward technology, advertising, product launches and other endeavors. Without a doubt, MercadoLibre\u2019s investment in Latin America will impact the company\u2019s bottom-line results for a while.\nYet, not unlike Amazon, MercadoLibre is making the necessary preparations to develop into a multi-generational e-commerce powerhouse.\nMercadoLibre\u2019s quarterly sales growth is undeniable, and the shares can still be worth owning even if they\u2019re not cheap. MercadoLibre\u2019s strategic capital allocations could solidify and expand the company\u2019s e-commerce market dominance in Latin America.\nThus, investors have a chance to capture the \u201cnext\u201d Amazon as MercadoLibre stakes its claim in an important emerging market. In the coming quarters, MELI stock should easily break above $2,000 and then $2,150.\nThen, the discussion will turn to stock-split possibilities and the next frontiers for MercadoLibre.\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

        "Title": "Amazon (AMZN) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Amazon (AMZN) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis online retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +164.5%.\nRevenues are expected to be $142.53 billion, up 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amazon?\nFor Amazon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +11.66%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination indicates that Amazon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amazon would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of +24.69%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAmazon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Amazon.Com,\u00a0Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is establishing cloud regions in Southeast Asia in response to customer demands for secure local data storage.\n\u201cThe reason for this is that many of our customers have been asking for that.\u00a0They really wanted something local\u00a0such that they can\u00a0meet, for example, local data storage requirements, or protection of\u00a0personal identifiable information,\u201d CNBC\u00a0cites\u00a0from Amazon\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels\u2019 interview.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon\u2019s cloud computing division, led the global cloud service market in the fourth quarter, capturing 31% of total cloud spending, says a Canalys report according to CNBC.\nAn AWS region consists of a physical location with clusters of data centers.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon AMZN is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30.The company is expected to have continued gaining from the solid momentum in the rapidly growing cloud market on the back of its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d).We note that the growing popularity and the strong adoption of AWS have been aiding Amazon in generating high margins from the cloud business. The trend is expected to have continued in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.AWS\u2019s revenues were $24.2 billion in fourth-quarter 2023, accounting for 14% of net sales, rising 13% year over year.An expanding customer base, owing to a robust AWS portfolio, is likely to have driven AWS\u2019s top line in the quarter under review.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2024 AWS net sales is pegged at $24.26 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.Click here to find out how the company\u2019s overall first-quarter performance is expected to have been.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nThe company\u2019s expanding AWS portfolio is expected to have benefited the first-quarter performance of the underlined segment. Growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities are likely to have been other positives.In the quarter under review, AWS extended its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with generative AI technology via the NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform. Notably, the platform features GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink.AWS\u2019s partnership with a South Korean AI startup called Upstage remains noteworthy. As part of the deal, Upstage launched its small language model called SOLAR MINI on AWS. It has also selected AWS to train SOLAR MINI with the help of Amazon SageMaker.Expanding portfolio offerings are expected to have driven AWS\u2019s customer momentum in the first quarter.Deutsche Fu\u00dfball Liga (DFL) extended its multi-year partnership with AWS to drive innovation across Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2. As part of this, AWS has become the official generative AI provider for DFL and has been the official technology provider for the latter.NTT DOCOMO also selected AWS, and intends to leverage the latter\u2019s robust infrastructure and cloud services to deploy its nationwide 5G Open Radio Access Network in Japan.Owkin selected AWS as the primary cloud provider. Owkin intends to develop generative AI applications and accelerate drug discovery and clinical trials with the help of AWS\u2019s scalable storage options, enhanced data security measures and strong computing capabilities.A strong customer base is expected to have continued to help Amazon, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), to boost its competitive position in the cloud computing market against Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google, which have been making concerted efforts to bolster their cloud market share.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Microsoft Azure has become the key growth driver for Microsoft. Azure's globally increasing number of availability zones and regions, along with strength in Azure AI and growing generative AI capabilities, remain noteworthy.Similarly, Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to the total revenues of Alphabet. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions, and solid momentum in generative AI have been positives.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Alex Weprin ",
        "Text": "Amazon filed its annual report and proxy filing Thursday morning, revealing 2023 compensation for CEO Andy Jassy and chairman Jeff Bezos, with Jassy writing the company\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, with generative artificial intelligence and Amazon\u2019s advertising business both playing major roles.\nJassy\u2019s 2023 pay package was in line with last year, with the executive earning $1.36 million, including a $365,000 salary and $992,764 in other compensation, mostly security services. That was up slightly from 2022, when Jassy earned $1.30 million.\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n'Legally Blonde' TV Series in the Works at Amazon\nAmazon Strikes Deal for Lionsgate, Starz Content, Including 'Outlander,' for MGM+ in U.K.\nAmazon Pours $2.75B Into Anthropic in Push to \"Accelerate\" Generative AI Tech\nIn comparison, Jassy received a massive $212.7 million compensation package in 2021 connected to his rise to CEO, mostly in the form of Amazon stock.\nBezos, meanwhile, received only a $81,840 salary and $1.6 million in security costs, the same as in 2022.\nIn conjunction with the company\u2019s annual report, Jassy also wrote his annual letter to shareholders, a tradition that serves as a venue for the CEO to outline his strategic priorities for the year ahead. Not surprisingly, generative AI was the biggest focus, with Amazon also adding AI expert Andrew Ng to its board.\nBut Jassy also noted that advertising was a priority for the company, noting the addition of ads to Prime Video, and new automated ad options for marketers. \u201cStreaming TV\u00a0advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start,\u201d Jassy wrote.\nHe added in an interview with CNBC that while ads on Prime Video are in its \u201cearly stages,\u201d \u201cI expect that we will continue to very thoughtfully find ways to place advertisements in the different entities we have.\u201d\nBut when it comes to generative AI, Jassy writes that it \u201cmay be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business,\u201d he adds. \u201cThese range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant), to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), to customer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others.\u201d\nAnd of course, Amazon is building tools and cloud products that other companies will build their AI products on top of.\n\u201cUnlike the mass modernization of on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, where there\u2019s work required to migrate, this GenAI revolution will be built from the start on top of the cloud,\u201d Jassy writes. \u201cThe amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all.\u201d\nAs for Prime Video, Jassy said that it continues to be a driver of new Prime subscriptions, but that it is also becoming a viable business on its own terms: \u201cWwe now have conviction that apart from the value it drives for the rest of the business, it will be a good economic business on its own as well.\u201d\nAnd, yes, sports will be a big part of that, with Jassy praising the NBA\u2019s product (ahead of a potential rights deal), and touting Amazon\u2019s WNBA package: \u201cSports are very attractive for our customers and you can expect us to do more.\u201d\nBut one thing users would not expect is a deal for another studio. When asked whether Amazon could be a bidder for Paramount, Jassy told CNBC \u201cI think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the offering we have right now and we\u2019re continuing to produce, you know, I think really great exclusive content.\u201d\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter\nHow the Warner Brothers Got Their Film Business Started\nMeet the World Builders: Hollywood's Top Physical Production Executives of 2023\nMen in Blazers, Hollywood\u2019s Favorite Soccer Podcast, Aims for a Global Empire\n"

        "Title": "3 Reasons Amazon Stock Could Soar in 2024",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has had a great first quarter of the year, with the stock rising around 20%. But I think that's just the beginning. Amazon has a lot going for it, making it a great buy even after its recent run.\nI've compiled three reasons why it is still a good buy. If you have some interest in the stock, I think these are good points to keep in mind when buying -- or at least holding the shares you've already purchased.\nWhile revenue growth excites investors for some time, they also want to see profits at the end of the day. But profits are limited by one major factor: gross margin.\nGross profit is what is left after subtracting the costs of goods sold, and it is essentially the maximum your profits can ever be (unless one-time benefits artificially inflate earnings to even higher levels).\nCommerce businesses have historically had fairly slim margins since their primary business model is to buy a product and sell it for incrementally more to make a profit. But Amazon has found other ways to boost its gross margin, such as service businesses. Because its service divisions now account for more revenue than its store divisions, its gross margin has seen a significant boost recently.\nThese service divisions include Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division; advertising services; third-party seller services, and subscription services. Of the company's seven segments, these four were the fastest growing in the fourth quarter.\nThese types of businesses tend to have higher gross margins. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't break out these segments besides AWS, but compared to other companies whose primary business is related to these types of services, it reveals higher gross margins. So if they continue growing faster, gross margins will continue to increase.\nThis increases the ceiling for what the company's profits could eventually be, an exciting prospect for investors.\nAmong its service divisions is AWS, which didn't have a great 2023. Many customers were optimizing their spending after years of massive expansion.\nBut the division's primary competitors, Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, didn't see that same weakness, so many investors expect AWS to recover in 2024.\nManagement is also optimistic because it continues to see that cost-control trend slow among its customers, while larger deals with longer commitments grow. As the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) data collection and model creation grows, demand for cloud computing products will only rise. AWS needs to present itself as a top option because Azure and Google Cloud have been doing a much better job.\nIf AWS starts to grow faster, it will generate more demand for the stock, as an important part of the company's growth thesis for years.\nAmazon is still not a maximally profitable company. Although it is producing ever-increasing net income, CEO Andy Jassy believes it has more cost controls to achieve.\nSo I'll use the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to assess the company's valuation, since revenue has been steadier than its net income. Even after Amazon's valuation run-up, it's still below the levels it traded at from essentially 2018 to 2022.\nThis is a great indicator for investors: It shows that Amazon could still reach a higher valuation and not be overpriced from a historical perspective. Combine that fact with a chance for revenue to increase with a better-executing AWS, and the stock could have room for more upside based solely on valuation.\nAll three of these factors combine to make me confident that Amazon's stock still has plenty of potential upside in 2024, even with its strong start.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

A: AWS revenue growth accelerated to 13.2% in Q4, with an expectation of accelerating trends into 2024. Cost optimization has largely occurred, migrations have picked up, and larger new deals have accelerated. Interest in generative AI products like Bedrock and Q is also contributing to growth. CapEx will increase in 2024, primarily driven by infrastructure CapEx to support AWS growth, including investments in generative AI and large language models.\nQ: How are you going to market within the application layer of the generative AI stack, and could you expand on the strategy for gen AI on the consumer-facing side of the business? A: Customers want choice and the ability to experiment with different models for different applications. AWS's Bedrock is resonating with customers for its ability to manage transitions and changes in generative AI applications. The coding companion, Q, is also gaining interest for its productivity benefits. On the consumer side, Amazon is building dozens of generative AI applications across the company, including the newly launched Rufus, a shopping assistant. These applications are expected to improve conversion rates and overall consumer engagement on retail apps.\nQ: Can you walk us through some of the key operational blocking-and-tackling that is to happen to continue to drive down the cost to serve back to 2018 levels or however you're thinking about your north star from that perspective? A: Amazon is focused on improving cost to serve by honing regionalization improvements, reevaluating the fulfillment network, and focusing on inbound processes and inventory placement. These efforts are expected to lower costs while delivering faster for customers. The company does not see 2018 as the north star for cost to serve but believes there is meaningful upside for further improvements.\nQ: How do you think about the idea of buybacks, share repurchases or some type of capital return programs to help shareholders out? A: Amazon is pleased with the improvement in free cash flow and debates and discusses capital structure policies regularly. While there is nothing to announce currently, the company has strong investments ahead and is glad to have better liquidity at the end of 2023, aiming to continue building it.\nQ: Can you talk about some of the levers in moving into positive operating income for International and how International could potentially approach North America levels over time? A: Amazon has seen improvement in International profitability, driven by cost to serve reductions, advertising strength, cost attention, and wise investments. The company is focused on customer inputs and improving efficiencies within operations. In established countries like the U.K., Germany, and Japan, strong revenue growth contributed to profitability, while emerging countries are on a trajectory toward breakeven and income contribution.\nQ: Can you provide any color or context on expectations around Amazon Prime Video ads? A: Advertisers are excited to access Amazon's Prime customer base, and the company is looking to increase advertising in streaming properties, including Fire TV and Prime Video. The ads are expected to be an important part of the business model, allowing continued investment in content and growth. Amazon anticipates the ads will not have heavy loads and will be useful for customers.\nQ: Can you talk a bit about the progress in unifying the grocery offering between dot com Fresh and Whole Foods and the opportunity in reverse logistics? A: Amazon is making progress in unifying the grocery offering, with a focus on improving the customer experience and leveraging logistics capabilities. The company is working on making it easier for customers to shop between nonperishables and Whole Foods and Fresh selections, with the potential to lower costs and increase traffic and revenue in the grocery business.\nQ: Could you talk a little bit more about the longer-term vision in health care? A: Amazon sees an opportunity to be a meaningful part of changing the health care experience, particularly in primary care and pharmacy. The company's vision includes improving the customer experience through services like Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical, which offer convenient access to medications and primary care. Amazon believes that integrating health care services with its retail offerings can lead to a better customer experience and potentially expand into wellness and diet-related services.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, PDD Holdings and Apple",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 24, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, PDD Holdings Inc. PDD and Apple Inc's AAPL.\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nAfter a dismal 2022, Facebook-parent, Meta Platforms, Inc. made a terrific comeback last year. Meta Platforms delivered record sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 and joined the trillion-dollar market capitalization at the onset of 2024.\nA rebound in Meta Platforms' flagship ad business and its cost-cutting initiatives further bolstered expectations for bullish first-quarter 2024 earnings results, slated to be released on Apr 24, after market close.\nMeta Platforms is estimated to report earnings per share of $4.32 for the first three months of 2024, more than $2.64 a year ago, representing a jump of 63.6%. Moreover, Meta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has a good chance to surprise in the upcoming earnings announcement.\nMeta Platforms' shares, rightfully, soared around 37% in the first quarter. However, its shares are trading in the negative territory in April, more or less matching the broader market. Skeptics doubt Meta Platforms' big spending goal on generative AI and the Metaverse as it may impact the company's financials.\nYet, Meta Platforms' current hiccup is momentary. Instead, the company remains a market darling. This is because Meta Platforms' digital advertising business is gaining strength from e-commerce firms in China.\nDiscount shopping app, Temu has given stiff competition to Amazon.com, Inc. in China as it racked up solid sales in the past year. Now, PDD Holdings Inc., Temu's parent company has extensively used Meta Platforms' Instagram and Facebook platforms with ads for Temu, something that bodes well for the social media behemoth.\nInterestingly, Meta Platforms is currently teaming up with Amazon. Links will be provided on the Instagram and Facebook platforms for users to purchase goods from Amazon. This initiative will boost Meta Platforms' ad revenues as well as improve transaction growth for Amazon. What's more, competing rivals could further strike similar deals with Meta Platforms, a tailwind for the company.\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives' inclination toward banning TikTok from operating in the United States should stand in good stead for Meta Platforms. TikTok is suspected of becoming a security threat as it influences public opinion in the United States. Nonetheless, banning TikTok will compel its audience to shift toward Instagram reels, and advertisements will follow.\nStatista, meanwhile, reported that the AI market is expected to see a CAGR of 15.83% from 2024 and 2030. Meta Platforms, thus, has joined the AI frenzy, which should help its shares gain traction. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg recently launched the Meta.ai chatbot. Meta Platforms has also launched an updated AI chip to enhance its data centers.\nMeta Platforms' bet on Metaverse somehow didn't look good for the company. Its Reality Labs division has been incurring losses for quite some time. But lately, with the launch of Quest 3, Meta Platforms' VR headset, sales from the Reality Labs division are poised to improve. Lest we forget, Mark Zuckerberg has already downplayed the threat from Apple Inc's Vision Pro headset.\nThe current year is also the 'Year of Efficiency' for Meta Platforms. The company has slashed umpteen jobs to streamline its operation. Such cost-cutting measures will help the company mitigate macroeconomic headwinds, apprehensions of a recession and higher interest rates. The company, anyhow, is cash-rich making it unperturbed to market upheavals. Meta Platforms' cash and cash equivalents were $65.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023, up from $61.12 billion on Sep 30, 2023.\nTo top it, the net profit margin of Meta Platforms is nearly 29%, way higher than the 20% mark, indicating a high margin. In other words, the company has kept its operating expenses under check and is worthy of generating the necessary profit from sales. In reality, Meta Platforms have been efficiently generating profits since it has a return on equity of 29.5%, which is typically considered good.\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms enjoy an economic moat. Almost half of social media platform handlers globally are using Meta Platforms' applications. This diversification and huge audience base protect the company from any downside risk.\nThe social media giant also began paying dividends recently, and a passive income surely shouldn't bother any razor-sharp investor. Meta Platforms' annual dividend yield is 0.42%, which is less, but the company is just starting. Thus, Meta Platforms' shares have more upside left in the near future and is currently a compelling buy.\nMeta Platforms' expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 35.7% and 15.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next years is 18.2% and 12.8%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta Platforms' current-year earnings has moved up 1.8% over the past 60 days. Meta Platforms currently possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of +161.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of +40.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.32 indicates a change of +30.4% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $142.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $641.36 billion and $715.6 billion estimates indicate +11.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 239%, thanks to unprecedented demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia continues to create value, and it's now worth $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft.\nThe trillion-dollar club is incredibly exclusive, with Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms being the only other members. However, another company might be poised to join the ranks within the next decade.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is an emerging challenger to Nvidia in the market for AI chips. The company is valued at just $270 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could see a gain of 270% if it does eventually join the trillion-dollar club. Here's why I think it will.\nLast year AMD unveiled its MI300 lineup of data center chips designed to process AI workloads. They come in two configurations: The MI300X is a pure GPU that competes with Nvidia's H100, and the MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to form an accelerated processing unit (APU).\nConsidering Nvidia can't keep up with demand for its chips, the door is open for competitors like AMD to snatch market share. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), AMD told investors it was working with tech giants like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta on MI300 GPU deployments for AI. Microsoft has already begun private previews with customers for the MI300X on its Azure cloud computing platform, where developers can access advanced AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\nAMD predicts the MI300 series could attract $3.5 billion in sales in 2024. That forecast was revised higher from $2 billion just three months earlier, which speaks to how quickly demand is building. Nvidia did $47.5 billion in data center revenue last fiscal year, driven mostly by its H100, so there is still plenty of room for AMD to grow.\nHowever, AMD's opportunity in AI transcends the data center. It already has a 90% market share in chips for AI-enabled personal computers, led by its Ryzen AI series, which includes CPUs, GPUs, and neural processing units (NPUs). The company says millions of AI PCs have already shipped with those chips, from manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and HP Inc.\nProcessing AI on-device results in a faster user experience, because workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center. That allows computers to host advanced virtual assistants capable of creating text content, images, and videos potentially without any network connection. Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year during Q4, and investors should watch for more rapid growth in the upcoming first quarter of 2024.\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, which means growth is sometimes lumpy from year to year. Consumers don't upgrade expensive products like computers and smartphones annually, which leads to an occasional lull in revenue growth for companies like AMD.\nFor example, AMD's revenue soared 44% in 2022 to $23.6 billion, but it came in at $22.7 billion in 2023, which was a 4% year-over-year decline. High inflation and rising interest rates didn't help, because they piled additional pressure on consumer spending.\nCommercial spending on the data center presents the same challenge. Tech giants like Microsoft normally don't upgrade their hardware every year; however, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will change that in the near term. He says $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure will be upgraded within four years to meet demand for accelerated computing and AI, which could drive a significant growth cycle for his company and the likes of AMD.\nWall Street analysts are forecasting $25.8 billion in 2024 revenue for AMD, which will represent growth of 14%. They also predict $32.5 billion in 2025 revenue, which would be an accelerated growth rate of 26%. However, considering AMD recently lifted its own forecast for MI300 sales by such a wide margin, combined with its soaring sales in AI-enabled computer chips, it's possible the company blows Wall Street's numbers out of the water.\nAfter all, Nvidia routinely beats expectations in the data center, and AMD's MI300 sales are only just starting to ramp up.\nAMD is currently valued at $270 billion, and based on its $22.7 billion in 2023 revenue, its stock trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. If that P/S ratio remains constant, AMD will have to generate $84 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation.\nThe company could get there within a decade if it grows revenue by a relatively modest 14% each year between now and 2034. AMD appears likely to meet the threshold comfortably in the near term based on the Street's forecasts for 2024 and 2025.\nPlus, despite the lumpiness in its yearly results, AMD's revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 15.6% over the last 10 years -- and that's without AI, which could be the company's largest opportunity ever.\nMultiple expansion is also a possibility. If AMD's revenue grows much faster than analysts expect, investors could be willing to pay a higher P/S ratio for the stock. Nvidia stock, for example, trades at a P/S ratio of 35.8 -- triple where AMD stock is trading. That would accelerate the company's path to a $1 trillion valuation.\nAMD is a very likely candidate to join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the trillion-dollar club, and investors who buy the stock today could earn a significant gain when it gets there.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

Amazon\u2019s website lists six Whole Foods stores that offer the smart carts.\nWhole Foods introduced Just Walk Out to shoppers in February 2022 when it reopened its Glover Park store in Washington, D.C., after a nearly five-year-long closure. One month later, the grocer announced its Sherman Oaks location had opened its doors equipped with Just Walk Out.\u00a0\nThe frictionless tech seemed to be working to Whole Foods' advantage as the stores outfitted with Just Walk Out outperformed their respective neighboring Whole Foods locations. The Glover Park store recorded a larger proportion of mid-afternoon shopper visits than the grocer\u2019s other two locations in the area, according to a 2022 Placer.ai report. Meanwhile, the Sherman Oaks store recorded more visits per square foot than a pair of nearby Whole Foods stores.\nDespite Amazon\u2019s sudden retreat from Just Walk Out systems at its grocery chains, frictionless checkout technology is growing in a number of small-format retail spaces, including convenience stores and stadium shops. In August, Grubhub and Amazon debuted a Just-Walk-Out-powered convenience store at Loyola University Maryland in Baltimore. \nThis story was originally published on Grocery Dive.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-04-29, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $62.04. It's currently trading at a price of $179.62. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -189.52%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$2.81\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.63%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n16.57\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n7.05\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n62.04\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $38.50. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -366.55%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "The speed with which artificial intelligence (AI) caught on last year took many investors by surprise, and it sparked a changing of the guard among the ranks of the world's most valuable companies. Apple was finally dethroned by Microsoft, which now tops the list as the only company that currently has a market cap of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its industry-leading AI processors, has tripled over the past year to take the No. 3 spot, behind Apple with $2.6 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all major players in the AI revolution and also members of this auspicious fraternity.\nWith a market cap of just $53 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like hyperbole to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, could make a run at the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI-centric servers and the company's decades of expertise suggest that Supermicro is a dark horse candidate in the race.\nWhile Supermicro has been creating customized server solutions for more than 30 years, the company was working in relative obscurity until the accelerating adoption of AI kicked off. It turns out that Supermicro has amassed quite a pedigree out of the glare of the spotlight.\nSupermicro has built its reputation by providing highly customizable, energy-efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale servers designed to handle the rigors of AI and hyperscale data centers. The company has developed strong working relationships and works hand-in-hand with all the top AI chipmakers to ensure its rack-scale servers are top performers while also providing energy efficiency and the lowest total cost of ownership in the industry. It boasts partnerships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\nThis is a winning strategy that has its AI-centric servers flying off the shelves. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 103% year over year to $3.7 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $5.10 jumped 85%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to $14.5 billion, which would represent growth of 104%.\nManagement reports that Supermicro grew five times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is stealing market share from its rivals. Analysts at Northland agree, suggesting the company has increased its market share to 11%, leaving \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nSupermicro is in an enviable position among AI server makers. The company is small enough to be nimble and has a long history of providing customized server solutions to enterprises. Furthermore, the strong and enduring relationships Supermicro has forged with chipmakers give it the inside track and an abundant supply of the processors used for AI. Despite those advantages and the clear opportunity, a lot will have to go right for Supermicro to join the ranks of the trillionaires.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.7 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $275 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. To be clear, the company is currently ramping up production to support annual sales of $25 billion, so revenue of that magnitude is still a ways off.\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit, year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2031. That said, it's unlikely the company will keep up its current rate of parabolic growth. If we cut its revenue growth rate assumption to 50%, Supermicro could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\nThere's reason to believe strong demand for AI-centric servers will continue. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya suggests the data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the next three years, and Supermicro's revenue could grow even faster.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is equally bullish, suggesting that the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the coming four to five years.\nIf Supermicro captures even a small part of that vast opportunity, the company will soon join the $1 trillion club.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Faizan Farooque ",
        "Text": "\u201cThe biggest reality competition series ever,\u201d Beast Games is the product of YouTuber MrBeast and Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) MGM Studios coming together. Based on Jimmy Donaldson\u2019s, aka MrBeast, already popular YouTube program, the series will have 1,000 competitors vying for a chance to win a $5 million cash prize. The recent action by MrBeast is creating a lot of interest in streaming stocks.\nOne of Donaldson\u2019s YouTube videos typically costs between $4 and $5 million. Beast Games is expected to have a much larger budget. On the other hand, the deal with Amazon is reportedly worth $100 million.\nThe focus is undoubtedly on streaming stocks now that MrBeast and Amazon have made their moves, given these stocks are already doing strongly because of Netflix\u2019s (NASDAQ:NFLX) return to profitable growth. However, taking analyst projections into account, we will investigate three equities that are cheap. If investors want to take advantage of the most recent news from Mr. Beast, they will provide some excellent upside.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\nUnlike the industry\u2019s heavy hitters, such as Netflix, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) continues to struggle this year, with shares losing 36% in value, making it a contrarian play. The firm prioritizes user engagement and income via partnerships and advertising on its vast user base; considering the lack of price momentum it\u2019s one of the more attractively valued streaming stocks to play the MrBeast news.\nThe plan has worked thus far. Four quarterly earnings surpassed Wall Street expectations, with the latest EPS up 55%. Roku will reveal its Q1 2024 financial results after the market closes on April 25, 2024.\nBesides financial performance, newer Roku Pro Series TVs stream better, with sub-$1,500 TVs providing high-end streaming. AI-powered recommendations and UI enhancements are in Roku OS 12. Moreover, live sports and enhanced design are on a new mobile app.\nOver and above that, Roku and the NBA introduced NBA FAST, which features historical games, highlights and current NBA G League games. Media Play News uses Roku\u2019s live sports streaming.\nMore recent Roku firmware upgrades increase content accessibility and Amazon Prime Video, Discovery+ and Vix Plus compatibility.\nRoku\u2019s deliberate improvements to user experience and content availability, especially in competitive live TV and sports streaming sectors, show that it\u2019s ready to change the narrative and justify its \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d with 20 ratings and 47% upside. Roku will capture attention among streaming stocks with its fresh product improvements as MrBeast plans his multimillion-dollar Amazon spectacle.\nSource: Shutterstock\nGiven the excitement around MrBeast and his collaboration with Amazon, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which enhances its services via partnerships and technology, is among the finest streaming stocks to purchase.\nWith the Seaport Stays Hotel, the firm provides Ethernet Dedicated Internet, Business Internet and X1 for Hospitality. The company is also growing its streaming technologies there. With this integration, Comcast hopes to provide dependable and expandable networking solutions to the hotel sector.\nFurthermore, Xfinity Mobile by Comcast provides more premium data plans and features \u2014 like streaming and limitless internet \u2014 than its rivals. For heavy data streamers, the new plans provide more value and flexibility.\nTo further provide tailored advertising, Comcast employs AI to assess the emotional tones of TV programming. This technology makes television more enjoyable by automatically matching advertisements with topics such as family values.\nAdditionally, layoffs of 4% affect engineering and installation personnel the most as Comcast\u2019s Sky subsidiary moves from satellite to internet streaming. But to continue prospering in a challenging climate, operations must be streamlined. More positively, new people are using non-traditionally installed streaming services like Sky Glass and Sky Stream.\nWith a potential upside of 28%, analysts rate CMCSA as a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\nAfter purchasing Discovery+ and HBO Max, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is one of the market leaders, thanks to an extensive content library housing hits like \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d and partnerships for content development.\nIn its strategy, WB Discovery is mainly looking to address digitization and streaming competition. In 2025, the business will limit password sharing to protect lost money on shared accounts.\nThe entertainment behemoth lost $400 million on $10.28 billion in sales in Q4\u201923. Therefore, password sharing must be forbidden for WBD stock to recover from its 28% 2024 loss.\nBetter news: Q4 debt repayments totaled $1.2 billion, leaving $4.3 billion cash. Despite losses, Warner Bros. Discovery maintained strong cash flow. Through acquisitions and increased ARPU, the direct-to-consumer segment gained 97.7 million customers globally.\nBesides the financial news, Tom Cruise has made his way back to Warner Bros. Discovery with the signing of a strategic agreement to develop and produce both original and franchise theatrical pictures.\nThe firm is also growing its content by acquiring Premier League and NASCAR broadcasting rights, which will improve its sports broadcasting segment.\nFinally, given the present economy, WBD is reorganizing to save expenses and simplify operations. This method helped WB Discovery reduce its Q4 deficit despite a 14% drop in advertising revenue due to expenditure reduction.\nAnalyst estimates indicate WBD stock holds an upside potential of 64% based on a price target of $13.61.\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "Author": " Lawrence Bonk    \u00b7 Contributing Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon is removing Just Walk Out tech from all of its Fresh grocery stores in the US, as reported by The Information. The self-checkout system relies on a host of cameras, sensors and good old-fashioned human eyeballs to track what people leave the store with, charging the customers accordingly.\nThe technology has been plagued by issues from the onset. Most notably, Just Walk Out merely presents the illusion of automation, with Amazon crowing about generative AI and the like. Here\u2019s where the smoke and mirrors come in. While the stores have no actual cashiers, there are reportedly over 1,000 real people in India scanning the camera feeds to ensure accurate checkouts.\nIt\u2019s also incredibly expensive to install and maintain the necessary equipment, which is likely why Just Walk Out technology was only adopted at around half of Fresh stores in the US. There have been plenty of frustrating issues for consumers when using this system, from receipts being sent out hours after purchase to completely mismanaged orders. In other words, it took a vast array of sensitive equipment and 1,000 people staring at video feeds to do the job of one or two people sitting behind cash registers at each store. Ain\u2019t modern innovation grand? To be fair, Amazon reached out to Engadget to say that the tech \"has continued to scale while reducing the number of human reviews year-over-year.\"\nThere\u2019s also some major privacy concerns here. Remember those cameras and sensors? They can be used to collect biometric information as people shop. This goes beyond Amazon\u2019s palm-scanning tech, as the cameras and sensors measure the shape and size of each customer\u2019s body for identification and tracking purposes. This led to a class action suit in New York that accused the company's Amazon One technology of collecting biometric identifier information without properly disclosing the practices to consumers.\nThe suit says that Amazon ran afoul of the state\u2019s Biometric Identifier Information Law, which requires businesses to tell customers if they are collecting data used for identification purposes. Peter Romer-Friedman, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, told The Seattle Times that \u201cAmazon owes its customers an explanation about how it\u2019s operating these systems before people enter \u2014 so that people can decide for themselves whether they want to provide measurements of the size and shape of their body as a condition of getting a sandwich.\u201d The company says that Just Walk Out, however, doesn't rely on the same biometric identifiers.\nAmazon tried to sell the technology to other retail chains, but didn\u2019t get too many bites. It teamed up with Starbucks in a few locations and there was a small launch in hospitals for medical staff, but that\u2019s about it. One sticking point? These systems require high ceilings to accommodate the cameras and sensors. Reuters also suggested that many retailers consider Amazon a competitor and disruptor, souring them on a technology partnership. Those 1,000 off-shore cashiers probably didn\u2019t help with the sales pitch either.\nJust Walk Out technology will continue to be offered in many stores in the UK. As for the US, Amazon says the removal of these systems is part of a larger effort to revamp its retail grocery arm. The company plans on bringing its Dash smart carts to retail locations, after a test at several Whole Foods and Fresh stores. These smart carts are equipped with scales and sensors to track spending in real time and, of course, allow consumers to skip the checkout.\nUpdate, April 3, 2024, 2:10 PM ET: This story has been updated to include information provided by an Amazon rep regarding the specifics of the Just Walk Out technology.\n"

        "Title": "Love Amazon? This Alternative Stock Might Have Higher Upside.",
        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a sensational long-term investment, thanks to the company's apparent disregard for staying in its lane. It went from being an online store for only books to an e-commerce platform for everything. And then it even went beyond e-commerce to develop business operations for shipping logistics, digital advertising, cloud computing, healthcare services, and more.\nAnother company with an ever-widening business vision is Singapore's Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). The company has an e-commerce platform and a video game division, and offers financial technology (fintech) services. And it's not content to sit in its core Asian markets. Rather, it aspires to have a growing global operation.\nEven though Sea stock is down 85% from its all-time high, I think it's surprisingly a better buy than Amazon stock today. Here's why.\nDon't misunderstand: Amazon is still a great company. The stock is sitting near an all-time high thanks to its soaring operating profits. Indeed, the chart below shows a strong correlation between Amazon's operating profits and its stock price over the last 20 years.\nOver the last decade, Amazon's operating profits have largely soared because of the success of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing services -- AWS supplied 67% of the company's operating income in 2023. But operating profits pulled back in recent years as it invested heavily in logistics to accommodate skyrocketing e-commerce demand.\nAmazon's operating profits are now normalizing as investments wind down. Management expects to earn $8 billion to $12 billion in the upcoming first quarter alone. Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon stock has more upside.\nCompared to Sea stock, Amazon might be a safer bet for making money. That said, Sea stock could have more upside if things go right.\nFirst, it's important to note that Sea stock is cheaper than Amazon stock by the price-to-sales (P/S) metric.\nTo value a stock such as Sea at just 2 times sales suggests that investors don't believe the company can grow -- at least not profitably. But I think the company's recent results disprove both opinions.\nConsider the chart below that breaks down the financial results for all three of Sea's business segments. Officially, the company calls these segments e-commerce, digital entertainment, and digital financial services. Note that the profit column refers to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\nSegment\nRevenue growth\nProfit\nE-commerce\n24%\n($214) million\nDigital entertainment\n(44)%\n$921 million\nDigital financial services\n44%\n$550 million\nData source: Sea's press release. Chart by author.\nOne of Sea's segments has declining revenue, and another has an adjusted EBITDA loss. But as a whole, Sea's revenue was up in 2023, and it was a profitable company. Therefore, the company can grow profitably because it's doing it right now.\nTherefore, the question isn't whether this company can grow profitably; the real question is whether it can capture a large opportunity.\nIt's hard to overstate the opportunities for Sea. The company does business in growing economies that are digitizing at a fast pace, such as Indonesia, Brazil, India, and more. And with these markets comes the potential for growth.\nTake Sea's focus on Brazilian e-commerce, for example. In 2020, the company entered the market. In February, just four short years later, it had already opened its 10th distribution center in the country.\nThese Brazilian distribution centers represent significant investment on Sea's part. But as mentioned, it's a big opportunity. Research group Mordor Intelligence estimates that Brazilian e-commerce is a $53 billion market today. But it predicts it will grow at an astonishing 19% compound annual growth rate through 2029. Other research groups similarly predict double-digit growth. And Sea is building the infrastructure to capitalize.\nSea is spending heavily on e-commerce. But it's worth noting that its growth is becoming more sustainable. In 2023, the business segment did have an adjusted EBITDA loss of $214 million. But this was almost a $1.5 billion improvement, which shouldn't be overlooked.\nIt's not just e-commerce. Sea's financial services division is obviously on fire. It expects a good year for its digital entertainment division as well in 2024, which is fueled by its hit game Free Fire. Management expects a return to double-digit growth this year and could soon relaunch in the massive market of India as it resolves regulatory issues.\nWith only $13 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, Sea has ample room for upside given the size of its markets, growth in those markets, and the strong demand for the products and services that it and its competitors offer.\nWith closer to $600 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, I'd say the upside potential for Amazon is much lower at this point, which is why Sea is a promising company for investors to consider buying today.\nBefore you buy stock in Sea Limited, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sea Limited wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "Amazon has engineered significant cost cuts across its delivery network over the past year, but CEO Andy Jassy still believes there\u2019s more to come.\n\u201cAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we\u2019re not done lowering our cost to serve,\u201d said Jassy in his annual letter to shareholders. \u201cWe\u2019ve challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there\u2019s more upside for us.\u201d\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nAmazon, Walmart Called Out for 'Excessive' Warehouse Surveillance\nAmazon Launches Low-Price Marketplace in India\nRetail Tech: Blue Yonder's $839M Acquisition, CommentSold Launches PopClips\nAmazon\u2019s cost cutting began in early 2023 when the company restructured its U.S. fulfillment network into eight self-sufficient regional networks, so that product could travel shorter distances to the end consumer.\nThis has helped the e-commerce giant ultimately lower its \u201ccost to serve\u201d\u2014which is the cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer\u2014by more than 45 cents per unit in the U.S. compared to a year ago.\n\u201cDecreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest in speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cMore selection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\u201d\nJassy attributes Amazon\u2019s wider success to its focus on creating what he called \u201cprimitive services,\u201d which are foundational building blocks like Amazon Web Services (AWS) that facilitate innovation for the company.\nOne such primitive Jassy identified was the company\u2019s 58 same-day fulfillment facilities, which have helped the tech titan increase the number of items delivered either same-day or overnight by more than 65 percent year over year in Q4.\n\u201cThey\u2019re located in the largest metro areas around the U.S., house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millions of other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities) and streamline the time required to go from picking a customer\u2019s order to being ready to ship to as little as 11 minutes,\u201d said Jassy. \u201cThese facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so positive for customers that we\u2019re planning to double the number of these facilities.\u201d\nBut Jassy believes the same-day facilities have a lot more potential to improve areas like Amazon\u2019s seemingly experimental grocery business, particularly for delivering organic products from Whole Foods Market or non-perishable goods such as canned goods and health and beauty products.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard on building a mass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if we used our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs or other perishable items to any Amazon order and get same day?\u201d Jassy questioned. \u201cIt might change how people think of splitting up their weekly grocery shopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\u201d\nJassy also acknowledged the recent hiccups seen in expanding its drone capabilities, with the company\u2019s Prime Air drone division seeing setbacks due to government regulations, layoffs and top team members leaving the unit.\nBut he doesn\u2019t appear to be backing off the commitment for the long run. Upon saying the drones were \u201cmaking substantial progress,\u201d Jassy said the service would be \u201ca very valuable future primitive capability\u201d for Amazon.\n\u201cDrones will eventually allow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won\u2019t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it\u2019ll be pervasive over time,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cThink about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\u201d\nThe CEO also talked up Amazon\u2019s robotics team, which has introduced new tests in recent months that have further cut metrics like inventory identification time or order processing time across multiple warehouses.\nSuch investments cost a pretty penny for Amazon. On the same day Jassy published his shareholder letter, the company announced it will have spent 700 million euros ($744 million) on robotics deployments in Europe alone over the past five years by the end of 2024.\nIn that time, Amazon deployed more than 1,000 robotics systems across its European fulfillment center network. The company expects to introduce 120 new pieces of automation technologies in 2024.\n\u201cSome of the biggest opportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobility of large cages across long distances and automatic identification of items,\u201d said Jassy in his letter. \u201cOur robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will be lynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading, large pallet mobility and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles).\u201d\nJassy also lauded the robotics team is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments, optimize the movement of its robotic fleet and better manage the bottlenecks in its facilities.\n"

        "Title": "3 E-Commerce Stocks That Have Outperformed Amazon Over the Past 5 Years",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a top growth stock to own for years. Its massive e-commerce business has helped send its valuation to around $2 trillion today, making it among the largest companies in the world.\nAnd so you might be surprised to learn that over the past five years, it has not been the best e-commerce stock to own. It's not even in the top three. Three e-commerce stocks that have been better buys than Amazon are PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).\nYou may not be familiar with PDD Holdings, but you're likely to know Temu. PDD Holdings owns Temu and the e-commerce site's rising popularity in recent years is one of the reasons PDD Holdings has been doing so well. As one of the most popular e-commerce apps in the U.S., Temu is even driving away shoppers from dollar stores. With cheap products, free delivery, and the ability to do returns on most items within 90 days, it has become an ideal option for frugal shoppers looking to save money.\nPDD Holdings released its latest quarterly numbers last month, and they were impressive. Revenue for the last three months of 2023 totaled $12.5 billion and grew at a rate of 123% year over year. Its net income of $3.3 billion increased by 146% from the same period a year ago.\nWith such incredible growth, it's easy to see why PDD Holdings has been one of the hottest Chinese stocks to own. In five years, the stock rose 440%, while Amazon's gains during that time frame are a more modest 102%. \nAt 21 times its trailing earnings, PDD Holdings still makes for a reasonably priced growth stock to own right now.\nCanadian-based e-commerce company Shopify has also been a growth machine over the years. It helps people sell products and services online, and it makes creating an online shop easy, even for people with limited technical skills. The ease in helping people sell not just locally but internationally has enabled merchants to grow their sales significant through Shopify's platform.\nFrom just $2.9 billion in sales in 2020 to $7.1 billion this past year, the company's performance has been impressive. The one drawback that has investors hesitant about the business is that Shopify's bottom line isn't all that great. In the past two years, it has incurred an operating loss. Much like with other tech businesses, Shopify overestimated pandemic-fueled growth trends, and has now had to retreat and cut costs to improve its earnings.\nThe company did report an operating profit in its two most recent quarters, but the stock could perform even better if management can improve the bottom line. \nIn five years, Shopify's stock surged 280%. Given its limited profits, the stock's valuation could look extreme -- it trades at more than 750 times its trailing earnings. But if you're willing to be patient with the business as it continues to right-size operations and improve its bottom line, this can be another excellent stock to hold for the long term.\nOften referred to as the \"Amazon of Latin America,\" MercadoLibre is another promising e-commerce stock that has generated impressive returns. Focused on the Latin American markets, the company is in 18 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. It also has more than 100 million unique active users.\nLike Amazon, the company also has a subscription service, Meli+, which is similar to Amazon Prime. Through Meli+, users can get free shipping and access to video and music streaming services.\nMercadoLibre is coming off a great year in 2023, with net revenue rising by 37% to $14.5 billion. Net income of $987 million also doubled from the $482 million that the company reported a year earlier.\nIn five years, the stock has climbed 196%, as it too has been an Amazon-beating investment during that time frame. But at 77 times earnings, MercadoLibre's valuation may be a bit high. If, however, you're willing to buy and hold, the stock may still be a tenable investment, given the opportunities in Latin America, and it's a great way to diversify your portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in PDD Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PDD Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-04-15, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $62.04. It's currently trading at a price of $186.16. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -200.06%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$2.81\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n16.57\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n7.05\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n62.04\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $38.50. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -383.53%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.
