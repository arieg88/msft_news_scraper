        "Text": "In the past 20 years, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares have skyrocketed an incredible 6,200%, turning $1,000 into more than $63,000 during that time. This magnificent tech giant has been so successful that it's now one of the most valuable enterprises on the face of the planet, valued at over $1.6 trillion today.\nPast performance is never indicative of future returns. That might be even more accurate in this case, given Amazon's massive size. But the business still has a lot of positive factors working in its favor, which investors can be excited about today. \nWhere will this FAANG stock be in three years? The answer might surprise you.\nDespite generating net sales of $574.8 billion in 2024, which is second only to Walmart in the U.S., Amazon doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon. In fact, this company benefits from multiple secular tailwinds.\nOf course, everyone knows about e-commerce. Amazon pioneered online shopping and has been a leader for about three decades. In the U.S., Amazon represents nearly 40% of all e-commerce spending. With in-person shopping still representing about 84% of all retail spending domestically, there's still a sizable runway ahead.\nWith Amazon Prime Video, the business has a formidable service in the streaming industry. According to data from Nielsen, Prime Video is the most popular streaming service, behind only YouTube and Netflix. The cord-cutting trend is only set to continue as we look ahead.\nStreaming should also feed Amazon's digital advertising ambition. Prime Video just started showing ads on its platform, which will boost revenue. Some people might be surprised to know that Amazon produced $46.9 billion of ad sales in 2023. This is proving to be a more critical revenue driver.\nOne of the growth engines that I didn't mention above is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's industry-leading cloud infrastructure provider that controls about one-third of the global market. Going forward, it's likely that AWS will become much more important to the overall business.\nAWS reported revenue of $24.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was 13% higher versus the year-ago period and a faster rate than was posted in Q3. Investors were concerned that the gains were slowing down, particularly while competitors like Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud were growing at a faster clip. So, it's encouraging to see AWS revenue start to pick back up.\nFrom a profitability perspective, the cloud is a financial boon. AWS reported a stellar operating margin of 29.8% in the last three months of 2024, indicative of how lucrative a scaled software business can be. As the segment continues to grow, Amazon's overall profitability should get a lift.\nGrand View Research estimates that the cloud market will be worth nearly $1.6 trillion by 2030, giving Amazon another gargantuan end market to penetrate. Even though the business is already massive, it's easy to see where growth can come from.\nAWS also makes Amazon a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. As more enterprises shift their IT spending from on-site to off-premises, a service like AWS becomes their backbone. This means various AI offerings, like Bedrock for generative AI applications, CodeGuru for improving code quality, and Kendra for intelligent search, to name a few, will make AWS a mission-critical platform for customers.\nThere are a lot of reasons to like Amazon's business. But before we figure out what the stock can do over the next three years, we need to understand the valuation.\nAmazon shares have soared 55% in the last 12 months. Despite this strong performance, they remain reasonably priced. The current price-to-sales multiple of 3 is still below Amazon's 10-year historical average. That seems like a good entry point for the stock to continue beating the market going forward.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations Thursday and delivered an optimistic outlook for the months ahead.\nThe stock climbed more than 6% in early trading on Friday.\nNet sales came in at nearly $170 billion versus expectations of $166.2 billion. That's 14% higher than the almost $150 billion the company generated during the same period in the prior year. The outlook for the current quarter also surpassed forecasts, with the company estimating an upper range of $143.5 billion.\n\u201cThis Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,\u201d said CEO Andy Jassy in the earnings release.\nAmazon's muscular earnings report and subsequent investor response followed more critical receptions to some of its Big Tech siblings, which also largely beat estimates.\nHere are some of Amazon\u2019s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\nRevenue: $169.9 billion vs. $166.2 billion expected ($149.2 billion in Q4 2022)\nAdjusted earnings per share: $1.00 vs $0.78 expected ($0.03 in Q4 2022)\nAmazon Web Services: $24.20 billion vs $24.22 billion expected ($21.4 billion in Q4 2022)\nAdvertising: $14.7 billion vs. $14.2 billion expected ($11.6 billion in Q4 2022)\nOn Thursday, the company also unveiled a new shopping assistant dubbed Rufus, trained on Amazon\u2019s product catalog and broader information from the web. The generative AI-powered tool can answer customer questions and recommend products on the Amazon mobile app. Amazon said a small subset of customers will initially be able to use the chatbot, and then the company will widen its release to more users in the US.\nAmazon's results arrive just weeks after the company eliminated several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios and announced a major reduction in staff at its video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, laying off more than 500 people. Staff cuts across tech highlight the sector's painful climb down from an era of rapid expansion, as companies are still resizing and retreating from ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\nExecutives said during the earnings call that it is still early days for deployment of AI products but that revenues are \"accelerating rapidly\" as customers express interest in developing AI tools.\nCEO Andy Jassy said that every consumer business at Amazon is developing multiple generative AI applications.\nThe company sees the potential for AI development to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to provide vital infrastructure.\nAmazon said that capital expenditures will increase in 2024, in large part due to the expansion of its AI operations. Cloud rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) both reported double-digit capex increases earlier this week.\nAmazon began displaying ads on its streaming service Prime Video in recent days. Executives declined to share estimates on the scale of the new ads operation, but noted that expanding advertising on its streaming properties is an important part of its business model to continue investing in content. They anticipate that Prime Video will not present a heavy ad load for audiences compared to network TV and other services.\nEarlier this week, Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Prime Video, began playing ads alongside movies and shows as the default option for users, who can pay extra for an ad-free version. Analysts have noted the significant potential for ad growth given the massive scale of Amazon\u2019s built-in audience.\nIn September, the company launched its AI service, dubbed Amazon Bedrock, which allows customers to build generative AI applications through existing models offered by Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon itself.\nThat same month Amazon also said it would invest up to $4 billion in the AI startup Anthropic as the biggest players in tech scramble for positioning in what they see as the coming age of the technology.\nAmazon Web Services, the biggest player in the cloud industry, claims about 30% of the market share, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The trio collectively account for roughly two-thirds of the market.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "5 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After examining many stocks in today's market, I've concluded that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the best buys available. Even though it's had a strong 2024, up 11%, I still think there is room for upside. I've pinpointed five factors that make Amazon a strong buy now, even with its great performance in 2024.\nWhile Amazon is well-known for its commerce business, it has quietly transitioned to a service business. These divisions include third-party seller services, advertising services, subscription services, and its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Combined, these segments brought in $92.9 billion in revenue versus the commerce side's revenue of $75.7 billion.\nThis is critical, as these services are vital for many businesses, which makes them more sustainable. Additionally, even though Amazon doesn't break out the profitability of each division, looking at similar companies like Shopify for third-party sellers or Alphabet for advertising, it's evident that services have much better margins.\nThis leads me to my next reason for buying. Thanks to the rise of service divisions, Amazon's gross margins have skyrocketed over the past decade.\nA higher gross margin gives Amazon the potential to have a better profit margin, which has also improved in recent quarters after tanking thanks to overspending to fulfill pandemic-era demand. This will be a key metric for investors to watch as Amazon attempts to transition to becoming a company maximized for profits.\nA key profit contributor is AWS, the cloud computing business. In the fourth quarter, Amazon's North American commerce business made $6.5 billion in operating profits, while the international business lost $419 million. However, AWS picked up the slack, producing $7.2 billion in operating profits despite having much lower sales figures (AWS had $24.2 billion in sales in Q4 versus North American commerce sales of $106 billion).\nAWS saw its profitability dip slightly as 2022's Q4 operating margin was 24%. But it promptly recovered in 2023, and Q4 saw an operating profit of 30%\nOne item that has come into the spotlight is AWS's growth. In Q4, it was up 13%, while competitors Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure both saw revenue growth in the high 20% range. While there are multiple reasons for this, Amazon's management is starting to see new workloads come online, which should boost AWS's growth throughout 2024. This is key as AWS is vital to Amazon's profitability.\nWhile Amazon has had a strong year, its stock remains reasonably priced. Using traditional valuation metrics like a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't ideal with Amazon, as it isn't fully optimized for profits. Instead, I'll use the price-to-sales ratio to evaluate the business. At three times sales, Amazon is valued at about the same level it was in 2018 and still below where it was during the pandemic sell-off.\nLast is maybe the most important factor of all: Improving cash flows. Amazon's cash flows are dramatically up due to AWS' turnaround, the rise of service divisions, and improving margins.\nAmazon's Q4 cash flows were the highest they've ever been and helped propel its trailing-12-month total to new records.\nWith that cash, Amazon can pay down debt, repurchase shares, or fund dividends. Those actions benefit shareholders and are the primary reasons for investing in Amazon's stock.\nDespite Amaozn's strength since the start of 2023 and so far in 2024, it's still a great buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "With a market capitalization of $1.8 trillion and 2023 net sales of $575 billion, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the most successful enterprises on the face of the planet. It has its hands in various consumer and business-facing markets, representing how powerful the company has become.\nShares have skyrocketed 907% in the last 10 years. But I don't think you missed the boat just yet. Here are two must-know reasons you should buy this FAANG stock like there's no tomorrow.\nThe first and perhaps most obvious reason that investors should rush to buy shares of this tech behemoth is because of how dominant it is. And in Amazon's case, it's a leader in multiple industries, something that puts this business in a league of its own.\nThe company's bread-and-butter segment remains its sprawling e-commerce marketplace, which had a whopping 4.5 billion visitors to its website in the month of January. Combining both online stores and third-party seller services, this division raked in $114 billion in sales in the fourth quarter of 2023. Despite macro headwinds, that figure was up 13% year over year.\nAccording to Statista, 38% of all online spending in the U.S. goes to Amazon, well ahead of Walmart, which is in second place with a 6% share. As e-commerce activity continues to chip away at brick-and-mortar shopping in the decade ahead, it's hard to find a bigger beneficiary than Amazon, thanks to its huge logistics footprint that provides fast and free shipping on millions of items.\nManagement successfully figured out another lucrative way to monetize all the activity on the e-commerce platform. I'm talking about advertising. This might surprise most people, but Amazon generated $46.9 billion in digital ad revenue in 2023, up from $37.7 billion in 2022. As shoppers visit the site with purchase intent, Amazon is able to effectively serve up targeted ads.\nAmazon purchased MGM Studios for $8.5 billion in 2022, beefing up its content production capabilities. This has propelled Prime Video to become one of the most popular streaming options out there. Data from Nielsen shows that this service is behind only Netflix and YouTube when it comes to TV viewing time in the U.S.\nAnd even though it's a leader in the media and entertainment industry, Walt Disney and its Disney+ and Hulu offerings are below Prime Video in these engagement metrics. This indicates how successful Amazon has become in the streaming landscape, giving it another growth engine.\nWith all the attention going to artificial intelligence (AI) in the past year or so, investors are likely familiar with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud services division. AWS commands about one-third of the worldwide industry's revenue, well ahead of rivals Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud.\nWith the industry set to experience rapid growth in the decade ahead, AWS is in a prime position to capture a lot of the gains. The need for businesses to incorporate AI capabilities will also help AWS maintain its lead. And because of its stellar Q4 2023 operating margin of 29.6%, it can lift profitability for the overall company.\nThis stock has been a massive outperformer in the past, and it's up 108% since the start of 2023. However, trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2, the shares don't look expensive right now for prospective investors. That's in line with what it was four years ago prior to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. And it's about in line with the stock's trailing-10-year average P/S multiple.\nGiven that Wall Street analysts forecast revenue and operating income growth of 11.4% and 34.7%, respectively, over the next three years, now is still a wonderful time to scoop up shares in this top business.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Demitri Kalogeropoulos, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Sometimes, the best stock buys are hiding in plain sight. Microsoft shares, for example, gained 1,000% in the past decade, even though the company was already an entrenched software leader back in 2014. It relied on competitive advantages, like its economies of scale and valuable brand, to reach today's massive $3 trillion market capitalization -- likely creating many millionaire shareholders along the way.\nAmazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) business could follow a similar path. The company has a long growth runway ahead in core sales divisions like e-commerce and cloud services. Profit margins appear likely to rise significantly over the next decade, as well. Let's look at how these factors might make the stock a screaming-buy opportunity today.\nOwning Amazon gives you exposure to two massive global growth niches: e-commerce and cloud enterprise services. The retailing segment is the less exciting of the two but is performing well. It recently set a holiday season sales record on accelerating growth.\nAmazon is still improving on this established platform, so there's room to keep boosting sales and profits as its Prime membership fees rise. Executives said in a recent conference call with analysts that they reduced average delivery time in Q4, even as they cut costs. \"What we're most pleased with is the continued invention and customer experience improvements across our business,\" said CEO Andy Jassy in early February.\nThe improvements were more obvious in the cloud services segment, which is expanding at a healthy double-digit rate right now. Growth has accelerated over the last few months, and management believes this lift will carry into 2024.\nThat's because companies aren't delaying their cloud migrations as they were in early 2023. As a result, Wall Street pros are expecting Amazon's huge business to grow at a double-digit rate, at least through 2025.\nThe stock wouldn't be a no-brainer buy in the absence of a brightening financial picture, though, and there's even better news on this point. Amazon's cash-flow trends have improved sharply in the past year, rising to a $32 billion inflow from an $11 billion outflow in 2022.\nMore of those gains are flowing directly into higher profits. Amazon's operating income soared to $13 billion this past quarter, compared to $3 billion a year ago. That spike has helped the company completely recover from its post-pandemic earnings hangover. Operating profit is back near an all-time high of about 6% of sales.\nStill, there are far more profitable options in the cloud services space. Microsoft's Azure platform competes with Amazon's Web Services division. The company is converting over 40% of sales into profits right now. Amazon's 6% profit margin is closer to pure-play retailers like Target than it is to a tech giant like Microsoft or Apple.\nThe bullish thesis, then, depends a lot on the company establishing new highs on this core financial metric. Even modest moves into the low double digits could translate into huge profit gains.\nAmazon's ample cash flow, along with the growing importance of the cloud services segment, suggests this move could be coming in 2024 and beyond. That services division now accounts for 55% of the broader business, and the proportion is likely to rise over the next few years.\nThe stock doesn't look too expensive, given these highly positive factors. You can own Amazon for about 3x revenue, a relative steal compared to Microsoft's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13 and Apple's P/S ratio of 8.\nYes, there's no guarantee Amazon's stock valuation will climb toward these tech giants' premiums. But investors have some good reasons to believe it will, likely driving excellent shareholder returns over the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Here's Why Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Amazon.com had US$73.8b of debt in December 2023, down from US$85.1b, one year before. However, it does have US$86.8b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$13.0b.\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Amazon.com had liabilities of US$164.9b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$161.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$86.8b as well as receivables valued at US$46.4b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$192.8b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\nSince publicly traded Amazon.com shares are worth a very impressive total of US$1.81t, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Amazon.com boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nEven more impressive was the fact that Amazon.com grew its EBIT by 176% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amazon.com's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. While Amazon.com has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. In the last three years, Amazon.com basically broke even on a free cash flow basis. While many companies do operate at break-even, we prefer see substantial free cash flow, especially if a it already has dead.\nWhile Amazon.com does have more liabilities than liquid assets, it also has net cash of US$13.0b. And we liked the look of last year's 176% year-on-year EBIT growth. So we don't have any problem with Amazon.com's use of debt. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Amazon.com's earnings per share history for free.\nOf course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.\nHave feedback on this article?

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't include any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements, it's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today we\u2019re reporting $170 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, $13.2 billion in operating income, up 383% year-over-year, or $10.5 billion and $35.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $48.3 billion year-over-year. While we've made meaningful progress in our financial measures, what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, adjusting and reimagining from teams across Amazon. Looking back at Q4, I'll start with our stores business where customers responded to our continued focus on selection price and convenience.\nWe continue to have the broadest retail selection with hundreds and millions of products available and added tens of millions of new items last year alone, including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's Secrets Fashion, Pit Viper, and Beyonce\u2019s Renaissance to our Merge to cosmetics from Lancome, Urban Decay, cosmetics and No Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, to consumer technology and services from Boost, Infinite, and Woop to homewares for Martha Stewart. Being sharp on price is always important. But particularly in an uncertain economy where customers are careful about how much they're spending. We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever.\nThese events also helped attract new customers and Prime members. Throughout the quarter customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day including more than 4 billion in the U.S and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S this result is the combination of two things, one is the benefit of regionalization, where we\u2019ve architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the U.S in the fourth quarter, we increase the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year.\nAs we're able to get customers items this fast. It increases the number of occasions that customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs. And we can see that in all sorts of areas including how fast or everyday essentials business is growing. Our regionalization efforts have also brought transportation distances down which has helped lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we've reduced our cost-to-serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S alone, cost-to-serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit compared to the prior year. Lowering cost-to-serve allows us not only to invest in speed improvements, but also afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices or ASPs and profitably. We have a saying, that it's not hard to lower prices, it's hard to be able to afford lowering prices.\nThe same is true with adding selection, it's not hard to add lower ASPs selection, it's hard to be able to afford offering lower ASPs selection and still like the economics. Like improving speed, adding selection puts us in the consideration set for more purchases. As we look toward 2024 and beyond, we're not done lowering our cost to serve. We've challenged every closely held belief for our fulfillment network and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there's more upside for us. Alongside our stores business, our advertising growth remains strong, up 26% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by our sponsored ads.\nWe've recently added Sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S. a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business. While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach engage viewers on Twitch, Freevee, Fire TV and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the U.S., as well as Thursday Night Football. Shifting to AWS. Revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year in Q4 versus 12% year-over-year in Q3. And we're now approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion. We watched the incremental revenue added each quarter and in Q4 AWS added more than $1.1 billion an incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which on an FX neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell.\nWhile cost optimization continued to attenuate larger new deals also accelerated, evidenced by recently inked agreements with Salesforce, BMW, NVIDIA, LG, Hyundai, Merck, MUFG, Axiata, Cafe, BYD, Arcore, Amgen, and SAIC. Our customer pipeline remains strong, as existing customers are renewing larger commitments over longer periods and migrations are growing. 2023 also was a very significant year of delivery and customer trial for generative AI or Gen AI in AWS. You may remember that we've explained our vision of three distinct layers in the Gen AI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which were deeply investing. At the bottom layer, where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute with a chip is the key component in that compute, we offer the most expansive collection of compute instances with NVIDIA chips.\nWe also have customers who would like us to push the price performance envelope on AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips, which are 40% more price performance than other X86 alternatives. And as a result, we built custom AI training chips, named Trainium, and inference chips, name Inferentia, and reinvent we now as Trainium2, which offers four times faster training performance and three times more memory capacity versus the first generation of Trainium, enabling advantageous price performance versus alternatives. We already have several customers using our AI chips including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh and Snap. In the middle layer where companies seek to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and leverage AWS\u2019 security other features all as a managed service, we've launched Bedrock which is off to a very strong start with many 1,000s of customers using the service after just a few months.\nThe team continues to rapidly iterate on Bedrock, recently delivering capabilities including guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, knowledge bases to expand models knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation or RAG and real time queries, agents to complete multi step tasks and fine tuning to keep teaching and refining models. All which will help customers applications be higher quality and have better customer experiences. We also added new models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta with Llama2, Stability AI and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs [ph]. What customers have learned at this early stage of Gen AI, is it there's meaningful iteration required in building a production Gen AI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed.\nCustomers don't want only one model, they want different models for different types of applications, and different size models for different applications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple and this is what Bedrock does, which is why so many customers are excited about it. And to top layer of the stack is the application layer, one of the very best early gen AI applications is a coded companion. At Reinvent, we launched Amazon Q, which is an expert on AWS, writes code, debugs code, tests code, does translations like moving from an old version of Java to a new one and can also query customer\u2019s various data repositories, like Internet, Wickes or from over 40 different popular connectors to data in Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Elastin or Zendesk, among others.\nAnd answer questions, summarize this data, carry on a coherent conversation and take action. It was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start, making it easier for organizations to use generative AI safely. Q is the most capable work assistant and another service that customers are very excited about. By the way, don't underestimate the point about Bedrock and Q inheriting the same security and access control as customers get with AWS. Security is a big deal, an important differentiator between cloud providers. The data in these models is some of the company's most sensitive and critical assets. With AWS' advantaged security capabilities and track record relative to other providers, we continue to see momentum around customers wanting to do their long-term Gen AI work with AWS.\nWe're building dozens of Gen AI apps across Amazon's businesses, several of which have launched and others of which are in development. This morning, we launched Rufus, an expert shopping assistant trained on our product and customer data that represents a significant customer experience improvement for Discovery. Rufus lets customers ask shopping journey questions like what is the best golf ball to use for better spin control or which are the best cold weather rain jackets and get thoughtful explanations for what matters and recommendations on products. You can carry on a conversation with Rufus on other related or unrelated questions and retains context coherently. You can sift through our rich product pages by asking Rufus questions on any product features and will return answers quickly.\nWe're at the start of what Rufus will do with further personalization and expansion coming, but we're excited about how it will make discovery even easier on Amazon. Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon, primarily because there are a few initiatives, if any, that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes, and we believe it will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years. In addition to our stores and AWS businesses, we continue to make progress on newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term. Touching on two of them. In October, we had a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper, which is our low earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400 million to 500 million households who don't have it today.\nWe launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems, made a 2-way video call, streamed a Prime Video movie in Ultra HD 4K and made an Amazon purchase over our end-to-end communication network. It's rare to be able to exercise all these elements in an initial launch like this. We're on track to launch our first production satellite in the first half of 2024 and started beta testing in the second half of the year. We've still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress. During the quarter, we also completed our second season of Thursday Night Football, which was a rousing success by all accounts. The customer experience continued to improve as our talent, production, streaming quality, analytics, unique AI features like Prime Vision and defensive alerts, all took big leaps forward on top of the very good start last year.\nWe launched a new NFL tradition with the inaugural Black Friday football game and our continuous innovation resonated with viewers as the number of people watching increased 24% year-over-year and with advertisers as we made dramatic year-over-year gains in ad sales. We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own, and we'll continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members like Thursday Night Football, Go To The Rings, Reacher, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Citadel and more. And with the ads in Prime Video, we'll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time. I'll close by reiterating that 2023 was a really good year. I'm grateful to all of our teams who delivered on behalf of customers.\nYet I think every one of us at Amazon believes this is just the start of what's possible. We have a long way to go in every one of our businesses before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw strong performance in the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue was $170 billion, representing an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $3 billion above the top end of our guidance range. Saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $13.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 billion year-over-year and $2.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. For the full year 2023, we had a meaningful improvement across our financial results. Revenue was $574.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Operating income tripled year-over-year to $36.9 billion.\nTrailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $35.5 billion, up $48.3 billion versus last year. These financial outputs are a result of a lot of improvements in our key input metrics such as stores' cost to serve, which decreased year-over-year for the first time since 2018 and our ability to deliver to customers at our fastest speeds ever. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our teammates around the world for a very strong 2023 performance. Focusing on the fourth quarter, North America revenue was $105.5 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year and an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. International revenue was $40.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, also an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3.\nDuring the quarter, we remained focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers, price, selection and convenience. Our shopping events throughout the quarter included Prime Big Deal Days in October and our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping event helped to attract new Prime members and deliver billions in savings for customers. We made meaningful progress on delivery speeds in the United States and globally, which helped strong sales throughout the quarter, including notable strength in the last-minute gifting where our ability to provide fast shipping helped our Prime members ensure that they got their gifts before the holidays. These improvements in delivery speed have led to increased purchase frequency by our Prime members across all of our major geographies.\nIt also strengthened demand for our everyday essentials. Categories like beauty and health and personal care, where speed is even more important to customers. Third-party sellers were a big part of our success over the holidays with worldwide third-party seller services revenue growing at 19% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 61%, its highest level ever. We also saw strong performance in worldwide advertising, which grew 26% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products as our teams worked hard to increase the relevancy of the ads we show customers by leveraging machine learning. Advertising only works if the ads are helpful to customers and there's a lot of value in tailoring sponsored products, so they are relevant to what a customer is actually searching for.\nWe're also continually focused on improving our measurement capabilities, which allow brands to see the payback of their advertising spend. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $6.5 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 6.1%, up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins were at their recent low levels in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen seven consecutive quarters of improvement resulting in a cumulative improvement of 800 basis points over these past seven quarters. In addition to the strong top line growth, which helped to drive improved leverage throughout our businesses, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost to serve.\nThe fourth quarter is our busiest time of year, supported by an increasingly large and integrated operations network. Overall, our teams executed extremely well, yielding strong efficiency gains with minimal disruptions. We were pleased with the performance of our regionalized network during the holiday period, where we saw benefits from improved inventory placement helping drive faster speeds and also lowering costs. We also continue to see benefits from lower transportation rates, which include linehaul, ocean and rail and from a more stable labor market, resulting in improved staffing levels. In our International segment, we had an operating loss of $419 million, an improvement of $1.8 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through increased units per box, lower transportation rates and leverage across our fixed costs as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations.\nThe International segment represents more than 20 countries of varying degrees of growth and our largest established countries like the U.K., Germany and Japan, relatively strong revenue growth contributed to the year-over-year improvement in profitability. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they continued to expand their customer offerings, while seeking to invest wisely. Moving to AWS. Revenues were $24.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $1.1 billion of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, we continue to see the diminishing impact of cost optimizations.\nAnd as these optimization slow down, we're seeing more companies turning their attention to newer initiatives and reaccelerating existing migrations. Customers are also excited about our approach to generative AI. Still relatively early days, but the revenues are accelerating rapidly across all 3 layers and our approach to democratizing AI is resonating well with our customers. We have seen significant interest from our customers wanting to run generative AI applications and build large language models and foundation models, all with the privacy, reliability and security they have grown accustomed to with AWS. AWS' operating income was $7.2 billion, an increase of $2 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.6%, up more than 500 basis points year-over-year and effectively flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\nThis margin improvement reflects our headcount reductions from earlier in the year and a slowdown in the pace of hiring. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $35.5 billion, an improvement of $48.3 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we are seeing across all three of our segments. We're also seeing improvements in working capital, notably in inventory efficiency driven by our regionalization efforts. Next, let's turn to capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, full year CapEx was $48.4 billion, which was down $10.2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by lower spend on fulfillment and transportation.\nAs we look forward to 2024, we anticipate CapEx to increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models. One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from 5 years to 6 years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers.\nWith that, let's move on to questions.\nSee also 25 Largest Banks in the US by Total Deposits and 24 Countries Where You Can Retire on Just Social Security in 2024.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n"

        "Title": "Amazon is more profitable than ever after a year of mass layoffs",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Amazon recorded its highest operating profit in its history in the holiday quarter of 2023, buoyed by revenue growth across all its major business lines and a year of heavy cost-cutting under the direction of CEO Andy Jassy.\nThe company announced on Thursday that its operating income \u2013 or profit from its core business operations that excludes certain items like investments in other firms and interest expenses \u2013 grew 383% year over year to $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, marking the second straight quarter in which Amazon has achieved its highest operating profit ever.\nThe record profits come as Jassy, who took over for Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, continues to put his own stamp on the tech giant, in part through heavy job cuts.\nAmazon previously announced 27,000 corporate layoffs, which began in 2022 and continued into 2023, marking the largest corporate layoff in the tech giant\u2019s history. Then, earlier this year, Amazon announced hundreds of job cuts across its gaming and video divisions. Going forward, Amazon isn\u2019t opposed to making more job cuts either, Amazon chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said in a call with reporters on Thursday.\nAmazon will \u201ccontinue to be careful on what we invest in, continue to invest in new things and new areas\u2026[but] where we can find efficiencies and do more with less, we are going to do that as well.\u201d\nAmazon, under Jassy, is boosting its bottom line through other means as well. Revenue growth inside Amazon\u2019s two most profitable divisions \u2013 Amazon Web Services and Amazon\u2019s massive advertising business \u2013 accelerated in the fourth quarter, and Olsavsky said the company expects that acceleration to continue in AWS into 2024.\nWhile Amazon declined to say how much of AWS\u2019 growth is coming from a surge of corporate interest in generative AI apps and services, Jassy told Wall Street analysts that he expects the area to produce tens of billions of dollars in revenue in the coming years.\nThe record operating profit was just one highlight from a blockbuster fourth-quarter earnings report that sent Amazon shares up more than 8% in after-hours trading. Revenue from Amazon\u2019s online retail business in North America grew 8% excluding currency fluctuations, marking the fastest growth for that segment in five quarters. Executives said the massive e-commerce business benefited from expanded holiday promotions and increased delivery speeds that successfully attracted many last-minute holiday shoppers.\nDo you have insights or a tip to share?

        "Title": "Amazon (AMZN) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Amazon (AMZN), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AMZN that show why this online retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\nFor AMZN, shares are up 3.23% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry is down 2.25% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 11.57% compares favorably with the industry's 2.61% performance as well.\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Amazon have risen 19.82%, and are up 87.87% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.73% and 29.55%, respectively.\nInvestors should also pay attention to AMZN's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. AMZN is currently averaging 49,567,624 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AMZN.\nOver the past two months, 16 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AMZN's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.60 to $4.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 12 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that AMZN is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Amazon on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    \u00b7 Reporter",
        "Text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got less antiquated.\nOn Tuesday S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets, and Amazon was a natural selection,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.\nHe added, \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"\nThe swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, healthcare, and e-commerce far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt said, was crucial in influencing the switch.\n\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you\u2019re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that\u2019s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"\nSilverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500, which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120-year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.\nOne reason a company can be swapped out of the index is if its share price deteriorates and becomes less relevant to the overall index. Walgreens has seen that recently with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.\nWalgreen shares have notably slumped as more shoppers move to online options like Amazon. The struggles of pharmacies were most recently highlighted by Rite Aid's bankruptcy filing in October.\n\"We don\u2019t like to change the members in there because of consistency, but at times it has to be done because as the economy changes, the index has to change,\" Silverblatt said.\nThe shift was a welcome sign from Wall Street, which now sees the index ending the year at 42,000, up from 41,000 prior the announcement, according to Silverblatt.\nPart of this call likely stems from the increased exposure Amazon's addition provides to the stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 higher over the past year.\nAmazon is now the third of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks to be added to the Dow, joining the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Those seven stocks, which also include Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), have helped propel the S&P 500 to a 24% gain in the past year.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $175.75 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 15.2% since the start of the year compared to the 7.7% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 8.8% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 1, 2024, Amazon reported EPS of $1.01 versus consensus estimate of $0.81 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.23%.\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $4.06 per share on $641.11 billion in revenues. This represents a 40% change in EPS on a 11.54% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.30 per share on $715.33 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 30.48% and 11.58%, respectively.\nValuation Metrics\nAmazon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nAmazon has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 43.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 18.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.2X versus its peer group's average of 16.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.53. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Amazon shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "For years, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was known for bold risks and minimal profits as the company invested in its businesses to grow revenue and market share, building out its customer base and competitive advantages.\nUnder CEO Andy Jassy, who's run the company for more than two years, Amazon has shifted from an experimental, growth-focused start-up to a more mature company ready to monetize its existing businesses and be more disciplined with its capital.\nJassy laid off roughly 28,000 corporate employees last year and shut down unprofitable projects like the Scout home delivery and Amazon Care telehealth services. Those moves helped the company deliver soaring profits in 2023, and that leverage was on display in Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings report, out last week.\nRevenue in Q4 rose 14% to $170 billion, beating the analyst consensus at $166.2 billion. The company's growth was even across its three business segments. At its North America and international segments, which are primarily made up of e-commerce sales, revenue rose 13% and 17%, respectively. North American revenue reached $105.5 billion, while international revenue was $40.2 billion.\nAmazon Web Services, the cloud infrastructure business that has been the company's primary cash cow in recent years, reported 13% growth to $24.2 billion. That was slower than both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, a sign that Amazon is losing market share, but it's still the biggest cloud infrastructure business.\nOn the bottom line, all three divisions delivered solid growth as well. North America's operating income was $6.5 billion, up from a loss of $0.2 billion in the same quarter a year ago. In its international segment, the operating loss narrowed from $2.2 billion to $0.4 billion, and AWS' operating profit improved from $5.2 billion to $7.2 billion.\nJassy explained the solid growth in e-commerce, saying, \"The regionalization of our U.S. fulfillment network led to our fastest-ever delivery speeds for Prime members while also lowering our cost to serve.\"\nThis is the kind of operational improvement that Jassy has excelled at, and it's no easy feat for a retailer the size of Amazon to grow revenue by 13%.\nAmazon stock still looks expensive on a price-to-earnings basis and the company's revenue growth is unlikely to accelerate significantly from where it is today.\nHowever, its operating income in the fourth quarter soared from $2.7 billion to $13.2 billion, and its margins are likely to continue to expand because Amazon's fastest-growing businesses are its most profitable. They are the ones that are built on the investments it made earlier, like its first-party e-commerce business and its massive logistics and fulfillment network.\nFor example, advertising revenue grew 27% to $14.7 billion. Amazon doesn't report advertising profits, but that is very likely high-margin revenue. Alphabet's Google, for example, generates an operating margin in the 30% range from its advertising business.\nAdditionally, Amazon's third-party seller services revenue grew 20% to $43.6 billion. That income represents the fees Amazon charges marketplace sellers to sell on Amazon and use its fulfillment services, so it's also high-margin. Amazon has a lot of leverage here as it has no direct competition from a large e-commerce marketplace in many of the countries it operates in, and it benefits from the traffic it draws to its site, making its platform attractive to third-party sellers.\nAWS should also see revenue growth reaccelerate as usage for running artificial intelligence (AI) models picks up, driving the need for cloud infrastructure services, but the company doesn't need AI to be successful.\nAmazon introduced a new AI shopping assistant, Rufus, and talked up other AI initiatives, but Amazon's competitive advantages are strong enough that profits should continue to grow at a steady clip and margins should expand in any case. And that should make the stock a winner again in 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was founded in 1995. It began as a humble operation using the internet to sell books. Today, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce company with an estimated 350 million products listed on its flagship website, which attracts 2.5 billion visits every single month.\nAmazon has expanded beyond online retail, though. It now operates the world's largest cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), where it offers hundreds of digital solutions to business customers to help them operate online. AWS is also home to many of the company's artificial intelligence initiatives, from designing semiconductors to developing large language models.\nThe company also operates one of the world's largest video streaming platforms, and it has a digital advertising business which is the fastest growing segment in the entire organization.\n20 years ago takes us back to 2004, before the onset of cloud computing, streaming, and digital advertising. Amazon's e-commerce business did most of the heavy lifting, and the company delivered $6.9 billion in revenue that year.\nFast-forward to 2023, and that number was $574.8 billion. That's a whopping 8,230% increase!\nOnline sales accounted for 40.3% of Amazon's total revenue in 2023, so e-commerce remains the company's single largest segment. AWS, on the other hand, contributes most of the company's operating profit, so it has become a major point of focus for investors too.\nThat operational diversity is what makes Amazon such a great long-term investment. Its stock has delivered a 233,220% return since it went public in 1997 -- or 33.3% compounded annually -- and it probably has plenty of upside left in the tank.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this online retailer have returned +11% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of +161.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +18.1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +40%. This estimate has changed +10.8% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.30 indicates a change of +30.5% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +10%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $142.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.8%. The $641.11 billion and $715.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.5% and +11.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Amazon.com\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nGreat news for investors \u2013 Amazon.com is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $241.39, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Amazon.com\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Amazon.com's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? Since AMZN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy AMZN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Amazon.com mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward. So feel free to check out our free graph representing analyst forecasts.\nIf you are no longer interested in Amazon.com, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 109% in five years. It's also good to see the share price up 19% over the last quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 12% in the last three months.\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Amazon.com moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\nIt's nice to see that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 87% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 16%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

        "Title": "Amazon collects $140 billion in annual fees from sellers. Now many are fuming over \u2018crazy\u2019 new fees they say tighten Amazon\u2019s grip on their businesses",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Things are about to get more complicated for many Amazon sellers\u2014and Amazon customers may pay the price, literally.\nOver the next month, Amazon is implementing the latest in a series of new fees for businesses that sell goods on Amazon, in changes that the company says are designed to speed up shipping speeds for Amazon customers while reducing the costs of such initiatives. But a half-dozen top Amazon sellers told Fortune this week that the new fees are complex and expensive, and may force them to overhaul their businesses and seriously consider ceding more control of their supply chain to the tech giant at a time when it is facing a government lawsuit that alleges the company is already abusing its power over these merchants.\nAll of these sellers told Fortune that at least one of the new fees\u2014called \u201cthe inbound placement service fee\u201d\u2014appears designed to pressure merchants to utilize a new Amazon service called AWD, or Amazon Warehousing and Distribution. Some of these merchants also said that this fee, coupled with another that Amazon will soon charge for low inventory levels, will force them to pass on price increases to Amazon customers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to sell on Amazon,\u201d said Albert Grazi, a highly-rated Amazon seller of seven years who sells around $5 million of water filtration products on Amazon each year through brands like the Mist filter line. \u201cYou are getting squeezed from all sides.\u201d\nAn Amazon spokesperson, Mira Dix, said in a statement: \u201cBy splitting what was a combined outbound fee into an inbound and outbound fee and adding a low-inventory-level fee, we will more closely align fees for sellers with our underlying costs while also providing sellers with more choices for how they use our services, giving them more transparency and control over their fulfillment costs. This allows us to create incentives for sellers to use our network more efficiently so we can share the cost savings.\u201d\nThe spokesperson said that \u201cmany\u201d sellers will end up paying Amazon less per unit sold than they did previously, but none of the six top sellers who spoke to Fortune considered that a possibility for their business.\nWhile Amazon is increasingly thought of as a tech giant as much as a retailer\u2014with significant AI investments, a massive cloud computing business in AWS, and a voice assistant that\u2019s become a household name\u2014about one-quarter of its total revenue, or $140 billion in 2023 alone\u2014comes from the fees it charges these sellers to host their products and do the unsexy work of storing and shipping their goods. In exchange, small companies can build big businesses by easily accessing one of the largest customer bases in the world. But now Amazon wants even more.\nIn recent years, Amazon has extracted a greater cut of sales from the small and midsize merchants who sell through its site, even as Amazon\u2019s reliance on these sellers continues to grow. During the final three months of 2023, the proportion of total goods sold through Amazon that come from these sellers\u2014rather than Amazon\u2019s own inventory\u2014crossed the 60% mark for the first time in company history. At the same time, from 2017 to 2022, the cut of revenue that Amazon takes from these sellers increased from around 40% to around 50%, according to the e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse.\nSellers pay Amazon listing fees, advertising fees, and in many cases warehousing, shipping, and customer service fees through a service called Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, that assures their items will qualify for Prime shipping. Amazon\u2019s third-party seller business\u2014known as its Marketplace\u2014is also highly profitable, the Federal Trade Commission has alleged, but just how profitable remains a secret that the company does not disclose.\nThe new inbound placement and low-inventory fees apply to sellers who already use FBA, but Amazon wants to play a role even earlier in their supply chain. In the past, an Amazon seller might import goods from overseas suppliers and then send all that inventory to a warehouse owned by a 3PL or third-party logistics company. From there, the 3PL will then ship out smaller segments of the seller\u2019s inventory to Amazon fulfillment centers and potentially those of other retailers. But with Amazon Warehouse and Distribution, or AWD, Amazon is essentially trying to replace those 3PLs. (Amazon also runs another relatively new service called Amazon Global Logistics, or AGL, that charges sellers to transport a seller\u2019s goods from overseas suppliers into a US Amazon fulfillment center.)\nOver the past two years, Amazon has also reorganized\u2014or regionalized\u2014its U.S. warehouse network to try to share inventory across eight regions to speed up delivery times and reduce transportation costs, in an effort to get more goods to customer doors faster and cheaper. With these new changes, if an Amazon seller is not willing to send goods from its own 3PL warehouse to at least four different Amazon fulfillment centers, Amazon will now charge an extra fee for every single item. The new placement fees will range anywhere from 21 cents to 68 cents per unit for standard-size goods, and 55 cents to $6 for bulky products. Pricing is based not only on the size and weight of an item, but also depending on how many fulfillment centers a seller will or won\u2019t ship their items to. Of course, Amazon will waive these new fees if sellers decide to pay for AWD instead.\nGrazi, the Amazon seller, said it makes sense for Amazon to begin charging sellers to spread their inventory across the U.S. But, to him, the costs don\u2019t net out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very high fee,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn't make sense how much money they are charging.\u201d\nJudah Bergman, the CEO of Jool Baby, a baby-product company that does tens of millions in sales on Amazon annually, says the introduction of these new fees and others announced in December feel like \u201c10 years\u2019 worth of increases and changes in one.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very experienced on Amazon and I\u2019ve spent so much time on this,\u201d he said, \u201c[but] for many items, I still don\u2019t have clarity on how exactly I\u2019m going to sell profitably yet. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nBeyond the new inbound placement fees that go into effect March 1, on April 1 Amazon will also begin charging many sellers a fee if they don\u2019t have four weeks of inventory in Amazon fulfillment centers. One problem, sellers told Fortune, is that Amazon also charges sellers for storing too much inventory in Amazon facilities.\n\u201cYou gotta precisely thread the needle to not get completely killed,\u201d Bergman, the Jool Baby CEO, said of the low-inventory charges.\nAmazon\u2019s solution? Again, sellers can avoid the low-inventory fees by giving Amazon even more control of their supply chain by utilizing AWD to replace a seller\u2019s existing 3PL warehouse relationship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear they are carrot-and-stick-ing us into using AWD,\u201d said a longtime, eight-figure apparel seller who requested anonymity out of a fear of reprisal for speaking candidly about Amazon\u2019s actions.\nDifferent sellers had different reasons for not wanting to use AWD. Some simply didn\u2019t want to give more control to Amazon, while another said they believe their current 3PL relationship will be cheaper. Two others said they\u2019ve heard from peers who felt the service was not yet ready for prime time.\nSeveral of the sellers who spoke to Fortune said that the company\u2019s marketplace has become a safer place to do business over the past year or two, with the company doing a better job of policing nefarious merchants who sabotage competitor listings. But the recent fee changes have them feeling resigned to the fact that a significant power imbalance remains.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna comply and send [my inventory] into AWD,\u201d Grazi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it.\u201d\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Title": "Amazon will soon top Walmart in overall sales but it still lags the brick-and-mortar retailer in one crucial area",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "After announcing blockbuster financial results from the holiday quarter and its largest operating profit ever last week, Amazon is now worth nearly $1.8 trillion.\nThe tech giant's market value is four times higher than Walmart and, depending on what Walmart reveals when it reports its own fourth-quarter results on February 20, Amazon may have just topped Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time ever too. (Even if Amazon doesn\u2019t now, it will likely surpass Walmart in overall sales sometime over the next year.)\nAnd yet, there is one key area of Amazon\u2019s retail business where it is still chasing Walmart from far behind: grocery sales. And yes, key Amazon executives care very much about growing their business in this sector now, just like they have for many, many years.\nFirst, let\u2019s be clear: There's a lot that Walmart, in turn, admires in Amazon. Walmart surely wishes it had something close to Amazon\u2019s giant AWS cloud computing business, which topped $90 billion in 2023 revenue and is one of the tech giant\u2019s most profitable segments. AWS is also a major reason why investors value Amazon like a tech stock and not a retail stock.\nWalmart is also chasing Amazon from way behind in online advertising \u2013 another highly profitable segment and a main contributor to Amazon\u2019s soaring market cap. Amazon\u2019s ad business grew 27% in the fourth quarter and topped $46 billion in 2023 revenue. While Walmart is making progress in this space, its ad business is still a small fraction of Amazon\u2019s.\nThen, of course, there\u2019s Amazon\u2019s third-party seller services business \u2013 basically, all of the fees it charges small and mid-sized merchants to list their wares on Amazon sites, pack and ship their orders to customer doors, and handle customer inquiries afterward if something goes wrong. That business topped $90 billion in 2023 as the share of total Amazon goods sold by these sellers crossed the 60% mark for the first time in the company\u2019s history. Walmart has been building its own similar offerings in this area too and many Amazon sellers have welcomed the retailer\u2019s efforts as they search for any possible outlet to diversify their online sales and lessen their reliance on Amazon.\nBut groceries have been Amazon\u2019s Achilles heel for some time. All the way back in 2005, Amazon\u2019s current consumer CEO Doug Herrington pitched Jeff Bezos on what would eventually become the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service. Herrington\u2019s appeal centered on his belief that the company could never build a truly massive Everything Store if it didn\u2019t sell the items that customers buy most frequently: perishable groceries and consumer-packaged goods.\n\u201cSelling a book or a TV is great and super helpful,\u201d Herrington told me in an interview for my recent book Winner Sells All, about the Amazon/Walmart rivalry. \u201c[But] how many times do I buy a book or TV each week versus how many times do I buy a packaged goods item, or some toilet paper or some food?\u201d\nFrequency of purchase breeds customer loyalty. And customer loyalty breeds high lifetime value for a corporation. Selling groceries at good prices also can make a retail business more recession-proof. When the economy sags, people cut back on nice-to-haves and prioritize spending on what they must have. Walmart understood this and expanded into groceries decades ago. Now it accounts for nearly 30% of all U.S. grocery sales, including revenue from its subsidiary Sam\u2019s Club.\nBut one of the main challenges for Amazon, which accounts for just 3% of U.S. grocery sales, in selling groceries and other CPG products online is that they typically have thin profit margins. Add shipping or delivery costs to the equation, and it\u2019s almost impossible to generate a profit unless it\u2019s a very large order. The key to Amazon\u2019s online retail domination has been Amazon Prime, but Prime breeds fewer items per order because of its simplicity of free shipping with no minimum spend requirement. In groceries and packaged goods categories though, retailers want customers to order many items at a time. It\u2019s one defect of Prime.\nSo Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017 for nearly $14 billion to try to make a dent. The results at the chain of approximately 500 stores have been mostly uninspiring to date. Amazon also started building its own grocery store chain \u2013 Amazon Fresh \u2013 targeting a more mainstream customer. The company, under CEO Andy Jassy, paused this expansion and is now remodeling a few of its 40-plus stores before deciding on the best way to proceed.\n\u201cThe results so far are very promising,\u201d Jassy said on a call with analysts on Thursday.\nLast year, Amazon also closed at least eight of its more than 30 Amazon Go locations, small-format convenience stores outfitted with an expensive cocktail of cameras, sensors, and computer vision that let customers just walk out after grabbing goods off of a shelf and automatically be charged for the items later.\nA former UK grocery executive, Tony Hoggett, now leads all of Amazon\u2019s grocery initiatives, so the experience at the top is there. Amazon\u2019s physical store sales, the majority of which come from Whole Foods, grew 4% year over year to $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAnd finally, Amazon believes the continued buildout of its same-day and overnight delivery will make the sale of low-priced packaged foods more affordable. Making money on a single six-pack of Coke or bottle of shampoo or Clorox if you have to ship it a long distance is nearly impossible. But if it\u2019s stored in a warehouse close to a dense population of customers, the calculus might change. Unsurprisingly then, both Jassy and the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, talked up this fact in remarks to both reporters and analysts this week.\nFor now, though, it continues to be perhaps the only remaining area where Amazon truly trails Walmart \u2013 and in a big way.\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Title": "Decoding Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon's robust financial performance showcases its market dominance and innovative edge.\nDespite strong growth, Amazon faces stiff competition and regulatory challenges that could impact future performance.\nOpportunities in cloud computing and digital media present significant growth potential for Amazon.\nAmazon must navigate the volatile nature of the tech industry and global economic uncertainties.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nOn February 2, 2024, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a comprehensive overview of its operations, financial health, and strategic direction. As a leading online retailer and technology giant, Amazon reported net sales of $386 billion in 2021, with an estimated gross merchandise volume of $578 billion across both physical and digital platforms. The company's financial strength is underpinned by its diverse revenue streams, with retail-related revenue accounting for 80% of the total, followed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and other segments. International sales, led by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, contribute a significant portion of Amazon's non-AWS sales. This financial synopsis sets the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis, providing investors with a deeper understanding of Amazon's competitive position and future prospects.\nBrand Power: Amazon's brand is synonymous with online retail, a testament to its customer-centric approach and innovative culture. The company's reputation for convenience, competitive pricing, and a vast product selection has cultivated a loyal customer base. Amazon Prime, with its myriad of benefits, has become a household name, further solidifying the company's market position. The strength of Amazon's brand is not just in its recognition but in the trust and reliability it represents, driving repeat business and customer retention.\nTechnological Leadership: AWS, Amazon's cloud computing arm, is a powerhouse in the industry, providing a broad set of on-demand technology services. Amazon's commitment to innovation is evident in its continuous investment in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which not only enhance its retail and cloud offerings but also create new revenue streams. The company's robust patent portfolio and ongoing research and development efforts are critical to maintaining its technological edge.\nFinancial Health: Amazon's financials reflect a strong balance sheet, with significant cash reserves and a healthy cash flow that enables strategic investments and acquisitions. The company's ability to generate revenue from various segments, including its high-margin AWS and advertising services, provides financial stability and the flexibility to navigate market fluctuations. This financial prowess is a testament to Amazon's operational excellence and strategic foresight.\nMarket Saturation: As Amazon continues to expand, it faces the challenge of market saturation, particularly in its core retail segment. With a broad product offering and global reach, finding new avenues for growth within the retail space becomes increasingly difficult. This saturation may lead to diminishing returns on investment in certain markets and necessitates a strategic pivot to maintain growth momentum.\nRegulatory Scrutiny: Amazon's size and influence have attracted the attention of regulators worldwide, leading to investigations and potential legal challenges. The company's practices, particularly around competition and data privacy, are under scrutiny, which could result in regulatory actions that limit its operational freedom and increase compliance costs. Navigating this complex regulatory landscape is crucial for Amazon's sustained success.\nDependency on Third-Party Sellers: While Amazon's marketplace model has been a significant growth driver, it also presents a vulnerability. The company relies heavily on third-party sellers for product variety and inventory, which can lead to quality control issues and brand reputation risks. Additionally, any changes in seller fees or policies could impact the number of sellers on the platform, affecting overall sales and customer experience.\nExpansion into Emerging Markets: Amazon has the opportunity to further penetrate emerging markets, where e-commerce penetration is still low. Countries with growing middle-class populations present a significant opportunity for Amazon to expand its customer base and increase market share. By tailoring its offerings to local tastes and preferences, Amazon can capitalize on the growth potential of these markets.\nAdvancements in Technology: The continuous evolution of technology offers Amazon opportunities to innovate and enhance its product and service offerings. Areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) provide avenues for Amazon to improve operational efficiency, personalize customer experiences, and develop new revenue streams. Investing in these technologies can solidify Amazon's position as a tech leader.\nDiversification of Services: Amazon's foray into areas such as healthcare, media production, and advertising presents opportunities for diversification and growth. By leveraging its existing infrastructure and customer base, Amazon can introduce new services that complement its core offerings, driving additional revenue and strengthening its ecosystem.\nIntense Competition: Amazon operates in highly competitive markets, facing rivals across retail, cloud computing, and digital media. Competitors with significant resources and innovative capabilities, such as Walmart in retail and Microsoft in cloud services, pose a constant threat to Amazon's market share. Staying ahead requires continuous innovation and strategic investments to maintain a competitive edge.\nEconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, including fluctuations in consumer spending, currency exchange rates, and trade policies, can impact Amazon's sales and profitability. Economic downturns or geopolitical events can lead to reduced consumer confidence and spending, affecting Amazon's growth prospects.\nTechnological Disruptions: The rapid pace of technological change presents a threat to Amazon's continued success. Disruptive technologies or business models could challenge Amazon's dominance in its various segments. Amazon must remain agile and forward-thinking to anticipate and adapt to these disruptions to sustain its leadership position.\nIn conclusion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) exhibits formidable strengths, including a powerful brand, technological leadership, and a solid financial foundation. However, it must address weaknesses such as market saturation and regulatory\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Amazon Stock in 2024?",
        "Author": "  Nicholas Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) investors are raking in the chips to kick off 2024. Thanks to the e-commerce and cloud giant's record closeout of 2023, the stock has been climbing higher. As of this writing, shares are already up 11% so far this year, and they're homing back in on all-time highs last reached in late 2021.\nA key factor in Amazon's renewed success involves generating higher profitability, not just all-out growth like in the 2010s. There could be massive amounts of fuel left in the tank, but is it too late to buy the stock now?\nSoftware-based business models (of which Amazon really has two, an e-commerce marketplace and public cloud services) are often called \"infinitely scalable.\" Amazon has certainly demonstrated this seemingly \"infinite\" ability to keep selling more goods and services over time. It hauled in $575 billion in revenue in 2023, far and away above the other tech giants (Apple came in at second place with $386 billion in sales in the last reported 12-month period).\nThat's quite impressive for \"young\" Amazon, which will just be celebrating its 30th birthday later this year.\nOf course, much of this revenue is recorded as \"product\" sales ($256 billion in 2023), aligning much of Amazon's e-commerce business with the likes of Walmart. Selling products, especially online, isn't exactly a high-margin business.\nHowever, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos always envisioned the company as a big tech player, a platform of sorts for the digital era. And now that it has scale of epic proportions, Amazon is only just beginning to flex its \"infinitely scalable\" superpowers. To wit, in 2022, Amazon recorded more full-year \"service\" revenue than \"product\" sales for the first time, and it's the services side that has the margins investors want to see.\nDuring the pandemic's height, operating expenses started to get out of control. Since 2022, Amazon has begun right-sizing its e-commerce distribution centers, as well as its data centers in support of cloud customers. The results since then, as measured by operating profit margins and free cash flow generation, have been impressive.\nThere is plenty of room for improvement here. Amazon's \"international\" segment still operates at a loss with full-year revenue of $131 billion generating a negative 2% operating margin. That's mindboggling, to say the least.\nThen, there's the cloud segment: Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leader in public cloud infrastructure and services. AWS generated a 29.6% operating margin in Q4 2023, up from 24.4% in the year-ago quarter when the bear market was still going strong. With cloud computing very much a high-growth market, AWS still has incredible potential.\nIn its core North American e-commerce market, Amazon is really in the early stages of unlocking profitable gains. For example, it recently launched ads on Prime Video and continues to tout its ads, product distribution, and other services to third-party merchants.\nIt would appear that Amazon's big jump in profitable growth is only just beginning. My base case scenario was for free cash flow of $50 billion in 2024, and that looks like an easy ask if the most recent trajectory holds. But based on this assumption, Amazon stock trades for about 35 times this 2024 free-cash-flow estimate. It isn't a cheap stock, but if you believe Amazon will continue growing and ratcheting up profit margins for years to come, this remains a top buy-and-hold stock for the long haul.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jeannine Mancini ",
        "Text": "When Jeff Bezos started Amazon.com Inc. in his garage in 1994, the concept of an online bookstore seemed far-fetched to many. Critics abounded, and numerous potential investors turned down the opportunity for a share of ownership, skeptical of its viability. Despite the doubts, Bezos remained steadfast in his vision for Amazon.\nA video clip from a 1999 interview with television host Jay Leno recently resurfaced on X, highlighting the skepticism Bezos faced. In the interview, Bezos, then CEO of Amazon, addressed concerns about the company\u2019s financial strategy.\nLeno questioned the logic behind Amazon\u2019s valuation, saying, \u201cThe company is worth billions, and every time I pick up the paper each year, it loses more money than the year before. The company\u2019s never made a profit. How does that work?\u201d\nDon't Miss:\nCan you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\nAverage retirement income in America has been revealed \u2013 Will you make enough each month?\nBezos agreed, saying, \u201cIt seems like new math, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d This early exchange reflected the skepticism surrounding Amazon\u2019s approach to business.\nLeno, with his characteristic wit, said, \u201cTo someone who doesn\u2019t know anything about this stuff, it doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d Mimicking the public\u2019s doubts, he joked, \u201cWe lost $12 million last year, and we\u2019re doing great!\u201d\nBezos, unfazed burst into laughter before he clarified, \u201cThis is not a new phenomenon. We are a famously unprofitable company, and we are investing in the future, which isn\u2019t unusual.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s approach to continuously reinvesting its profits into expansion, innovation and diversification has been a cornerstone of its strategy. This reinvestment strategy allowed Amazon to scale its operations significantly and expand into various sectors beyond e-commerce, such as cloud computing with Amazon Web Services, digital streaming and artificial intelligence.\nTrending: Are you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the fourth quarter of 2001 that Amazon first turned a profit, earning $0.01 per share on revenue of more than $1 billion. This milestone was followed by a more significant achievement in 2003 when Amazon reported its first full year of profitability, earning $35 million for the year, up from a $149 million loss the previous year\u200b\u200b. This marked a turning point for Amazon, validating its long-term growth strategy and its focus on reinvesting in the business.\nDespite initial doubts, Amazon\u2019s strategy of reinvesting profits into expansion and innovation has paid off. The company, once criticized for its lack of profitability, has evolved into a $1.77 trillion entity as of February. This growth signifies a dramatic transformation in market strategy and impact, establishing Amazon as a leader in e-commerce, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\nBezos\u2019s wealth has grown substantially, placing him as one of the richest men in the world.

        "Author": "  Leo Schwartz ",
        "Text": "When Marcos Galperin started online marketplace MercadoLibre in a parking garage, he wasn\u2019t trying to evoke the origin stories of U.S. tech companies like Hewlett-Packard and Apple. In Buenos Aires in 1999, the garage of his father\u2019s leather company was just the best option for fast broadband internet. \u201cIt was a building with terrible offices, but at least we had good connectivity,\u201d he says.\nBut like his Big Tech brethren, Galperin spun gold from the dingiest of spaces. Today, Galperin is one of the wealthiest men in Latin America, with an estimated net worth of over $7\u00a0billion thanks to MercadoLibre\u2019s astronomical growth. The company, now based in Uruguay, started as a clone of eBay but today is known as the Amazon of Latin America. The e-commerce site sold over $11\u00a0billion in goods in the third quarter of 2023, a nearly 60% increase year over year.\nMercadoLibre\u2019s marketplace resembles Amazon, selling goods from electronics to supermarket basics with the promise of 24-hour delivery, but it would be a disservice to paint Galperin as a Jeff Bezos imitator. He has combined MercadoLibre\u2019s e-commerce prowess with payment tools to usher regional shopping into the digital age. By adapting to the complex challenges of Latin America and reinventing MercadoLibre over the course of 25 years, Galperin created a tech company with a market cap of nearly $85\u00a0billion, second only to Brazil\u2019s state-owned energy giant Petrobras in Latin America. Its regional dominance has little parallel in the rest of the world.\nAs U.S. and Asian competitors vie for Latin America\u2019s red-hot e-commerce market, and regional politics poses risks to its business, Galperin keeps pushing MercadoLibre into new sectors, from mutual funds to crypto. \u201cWe\u2019re always paranoid,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s game over by any means.\u201d\nGalperin, 52, came of age in an Argentina that bears little resemblance to the country that today is suffering from skyrocketing inflation. The relative stability of the 1990s and his family\u2019s flourishing leather company gave Galperin the opportunity to attend the University of Pennsylvania. He enrolled at Stanford Business School in 1997.\nOver a video call from his office in Uruguay, Galperin, who has salt-and-pepper hair and a quiet affect, recalls how he marveled over the digital advances of U.S. tech companies as a student in Palo Alto. Sites like eBay were converting droves of new online shoppers. Galperin even sold his Volkswagen Golf via an early online classified ad. \u201cI was very enthusiastic about what I thought the internet was going to do to the world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was very frustrated because I had to come back to Latin America, and there was nothing.\u201d\nGalperin was convinced that an eBay-type platform would explode in Latin America, where problems with retail ran deeper than a lack of web applications. Brick-and-mortar retail was available only in major urban areas, with more rural regions cut off from shopping. \u201cPeople would rather live in a slum next to a big city than live in better conditions in the countryside,\u201d Galperin says. \u201cSo I was convinced this was going to work really, really well in Latin America.\u201d\n\u201cI was very enthusiastic about what I thought the internet was going to do to the world.\u201d\nBack in Argentina, Galperin and his early team erected makeshift cubicles in the parking garage. From the windowless space they conceived of MercadoLibre. (The building eventually kicked them out for violating safety codes.) Galperin had been inspired by eBay\u2014and in fact, eBay was an early investor in MercadoLibre\u2014but early on he abandoned its auction model; he wanted to build a platform that people came to for everyday shopping, not just the thrill of a ticking clock. MercadoLibre launched its marketplace that connects buyers with third-party sellers in 1999, a year before Amazon.\nMercadoLibre expanded to Brazil and Mexico in its first year. By the time it went public in 2007, it had earned its \u201cAmazon of Latin America\u201d moniker, but its annual revenue remained low, crossing $100\u00a0million in 2008 and $1\u00a0billion in 2017. The pandemic accelerated growth, and revenue topped $10\u00a0billion in 2022.\nGalperin doesn\u2019t mind the association with\u2014or attention from\u2014U.S. counterparts. He claims eBay came close to buying MercadoLibre several times, most recently in the 2010s. (eBay did not return a request for comment.) He says he admires Amazon\u2019s long-term vision, but Galperin set MercadoLibre on a different path as it navigated Latin America\u2019s logistical snarls. \u201cMercadoLibre is not really the copy of Amazon in Latin America,\u201d says Guillermo Ochovo, director at consulting firm Cargo Facts. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing their own thing.\u201d\nWhile Amazon established a second business out of cloud-hosting, MercadoLibre expanded into payments, more out of necessity than diversification. In Mexico, one of MercadoLibre\u2019s main markets, less than 25% of the urban population held a savings account in 2000. Sales that MercadoLibre facilitated between vendors and buyers often took place in person and in cash, with no way for MercadoLibre to verify transactions to earn its cut. \u201cWe were at the mercy of whatever the sellers claimed had happened,\u201d Galperin says.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nSo in 2003 MercadoLibre launched Mercado Pago, a payments system that let users load their balances with cash. Later it added features like a point-of-sale system and QR code payments that could be used outside its marketplace. Merchants\u2014from storefronts to food stalls\u2014could accept payments via Mercado Pago. The innovations fueled adoption of online financial tools. In the first three quarters of 2023, Mercado Pago reported 167\u00a0million active users and processed over 6.5\u00a0billion transactions.\n\u201cPeople that have traditionally been unbanked are not willing to walk into a bank branch,\u201d says Galperin. \u201cThey feel that it\u2019s not for them and they will be laughed out of the place.\u201d\nIn 2017, the company expanded into the credit business, offering financing to customers and merchants to make purchases, build out their businesses, and even pay taxes. In the third quarter of 2023, fintech accounted for over 43% of MercadoLibre\u2019s revenue of $3.8 billion. \u201cMercadoLibre is really a payments company,\u201d says Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of business intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.\nMercadoLibre also set itself apart by partnering with local companies to adapt to the logistical challenges of countries in the region. In Brazil, the largest market in Latin America, e-commerce companies struggled with deliveries, since homes there might not have addresses or may be in dangerous areas. Through logistics company Kangu, MercadoLibre connected sellers to local shops that served as delivery points. MercadoLibre acquired Kangu in 2021.\nMercadoLibre has also benefited from \u201cbeing a company of Latin America, from Latin America, and for Latin America,\u201d says Matteo Ceurvels, principal Latin America analyst for eMarketer. MercadoLibre went as far as to change its name in Brazil to MercadoLivre, Portuguese for \u201cfree market.\u201d Amazon, meanwhile, struggled to properly translate its website when it launched there, says Ochovo. (Amazon didn\u2019t return a request for comment.) In 2022, MercadoLibre accounted for 34% of online sales in Brazil\u2014nearly the same share as its two largest competitors combined.\n\u201cMercadoLibre is not really\u00a0the copy of Amazon in\u00a0Latin America. They\u2019ve been doing their own thing.\u201d\nAsian e-commerce companies like Temu, Shein, and Shopee may pose a greater threat to MercadoLibre than Amazon ever did, with their gamified shopping and low-priced inventory. MercadoLibre has responded in a few ways; it launched a short video platform called Clips in 2023 that mirrors its Asian rivals. But so far the new competition hasn\u2019t made much of a dent in MercadoLibre\u2019s business, Ochovo says. The upstarts are still struggling to figure out the particularities of different Latin American markets. After a much-hyped expansion, Shopee closed operations in four countries in 2022.\nFor now, Galperin remains focused on payments. In response to Argentina\u2019s economic turmoil, he wants to create hedges against inflation that reached 185% in 2023. In 2018, MercadoLibre started offering Argentine customers the option to invest in mutual funds. By late last year, 12\u00a0million users\u2014equal to 25% of the nation\u2019s population\u2014used the feature, MercadoLibre says. Starting in 2022, it added a tool to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, including U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoins. (Argentina\u2019s Central Bank banned the feature, but it\u2019s available in other markets.)\nAmong MercadoLibre\u2019s largest markets, Argentina is a distant second to Brazil, but it remains Galperin\u2019s spiritual, if not physical, home. And the country represents how the region\u2019s economic and political uncertainty poses a perpetual threat to its business.\nGalperin has long clashed with Argentina\u2019s presidential administrations and has resided across the La Plata River in Uruguay for years. He returned under center-right Mauricio Macri, but in 2020 resigned as president of MercadoLibre\u2019s Argentina unit after a federal prosecutor accused Galperin and his board of fraud and insider trading. Galperin denied the charges but left the country again. The case has been dropped.\nArgentina stunned the world in November by electing as president the self-proclaimed \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d Javier Milei, who has vowed to impose a bruising austerity campaign. Galperin is cautiously optimistic about the firebrand: \u201cI\u2019m enthusiastic about the ideas he advocates.\u201d\nGalperin recognizes that Milei\u2019s economic policies are causing the prices of everyday items like diapers and beef to soar. The whiplash is challenging MercadoLibre\u2019s operations, but he says he\u2019s accustomed to volatility. After all, the company has operated in Venezuela since 2005.\nGalperin says that the possibility of punishing days ahead evokes his early vision for MercadoLibre\u2014to serve customers living on informal salaries or without ready access to goods. \u201cWhat we do, at the end of the day, helps the weakest people in Latin America,\u201d he says. \u201cI worry more about the country than I worry about the company.\u201d\nThis article appears in the February/March 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cIn focus: Marcos Galperin.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Demitri Kalogeropoulos, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors received plenty of good news in Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) recent earnings update. The tech giant revealed strong Q4 growth in both its e-commerce segment and in the services division that's quickly becoming the dominant part of its business. Wall Street reacted by pushing the stock up over 10% so far in 2024 following Amazon's market-thumping rally last year.\nAmazon's growth is accelerating across the board even as expenses are dropping. Those are excellent reasons to consider buying the stock right now. Yet there's even better news regarding Amazon's cash flow.\nLet's dive right in.\nGrowth is a key pillar of the bullish investment thesis, and there's good reason to be excited about Amazon's progress here. The post-pandemic e-commerce sales lull appears to be over, for one. This past quarter's 9% boost in product sales translated into a record holiday shopping season, management said in early February. The company delivered products more quickly and at a lower average cost, too, which is great news for both customer loyalty and profitability.\nThere's a significant rebound in the works in cloud services following weakening growth trends in early 2023. Enterprises are back to migrating more of their work processes onto Amazon Web Services, management said in a conference call with investors. That means this business, which accounted for 55% of sales this past year, is likely to continue growing in importance to Amazon's wider revenue ambitions. Services sales accelerated to a 13% increase last quarter from 12% in fiscal Q3.\nInvestors should be even more optimistic about free cash flow trends. Cash flow is a great predictor of earnings power, after all, and it is more informative than simply following bottom-line profits, which can swing wildly from quarter to quarter.\nThe news is unambiguously positive here. Amazon's free cash flow soared to $37 billion in the past year compared to a $12 billion outflow in fiscal 2022. This boost means the company has the flexibility to invest in growth areas like generative artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers, as well as a more robust delivery network.\nYet executives are also allowing more of that cash flow to support rising profitability. Operating profit margin is racing back toward its pandemic high of about 7% of sales. There's a good chance that this figure will cross 10% in the coming years as the company tilts further toward those high-margin services sales.\nMost Wall Street pros are looking for sales to rise at about the same 12% rate that shareholders saw in 2023. Earnings will jump to $4 per share from $2.90 per share this past year, they estimate.\nIn that context, investors should consider the stock a good deal even following its recent rally. Shares are priced at 3 times sales, or about halfway between the pandemic highs in mid-2020 and the post-pandemic low set in late 2022.\nThe biggest knock against Amazon's business as compared to other elite tech stocks is that its profit margins aren't magnificent. Apple books over 30% of its revenue as operating profit, and Microsoft converts more than 44% of sales into operating profit. If Amazon can keep closing the gap with these rivals, shareholders should be rewarded with more gains ahead. Keep an eye on cash flow trends for confirmation that the business remains on that positive track.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "The \"Amazon of Latin America\" Launched Its Own Version of Prime. Can It Boost the Stock?",
        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) runs one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the world. It may not be a company U.S. consumers are familiar with, but its dominance in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico has many people referring to it as the \"Amazon of Latin America.\"\nThe company reported $41 billion in gross merchandise volume on its platform over the last 12 months, and it's achieved this impressive level of adoption, in part, due to its logistics network.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, MercadoLibre handled well over 200 million shipments, and of these shipments, more than half were delivered on the same day or the next day. Moreover, 80% of shipments were delivered in 48 hours or less. While this speed is somewhat commonplace in the U.S., this is a monumental achievement for Latin America.\nAnd to build on its leadership and reach in the region, the company just launched its own version of Prime.\nAmazon was able to grow its market penetration by launching its Prime membership service back in 2005. Now, the service is well-known for perks like free two-day shipping and access to Prime Video, among others, and it fueled the growth of Amazon's marketplace to world-class levels.\nHere's what investors need to know about MercadoLibre's own take on a membership service, Meli+.\nMeli+ is similar to Amazon Prime in many respects. Select items are eligible for free shipping if the total value of the order is above a certain threshold. Users also have to agree to receiving the shipment on certain days so the company can bundle orders together. Users who can't wait would have to pay for shipping.\nThe shipping perk alone should boost growth of MercadoLibre's e-commerce platform. The company had more than 50 million unique buyers in Q3, which leaves room for a lot of growth in its key markets. But sometimes people need a little more incentive to try something new, and free shipping with Meli+ could do the trick.\nThat said, it's possible to lose a lot of money in logistics and fulfillment. The company is trying to be more efficient by limiting the free shipping offer to specific delivery days, which should help profitability.\nAnother similarity between Amazon Prime and Meli+ is the offer of streaming video content. However, there's a major difference between the two. Whereas Amazon produces some original content for its streaming service, Meli+ subscribers will get free access to Walt Disney's Disney+ and Star+ platforms.\nIn the near term, MercadoLibre's arrangement with Disney is extremely advantageous. As management for Amazon or Netflix will tell you, producing original video content requires significant investment. MercadoLibre will offer its members the perk of a streaming service without the expense or hassle of producing content.\nTo top off the benefits, Meli+ members will also enjoy a free year of access to streaming music through Deezer, discounts on other services like HBO Max and Paramount+, and exclusive offers on the company's marketplace.\nGoing forward, investors should watch MercadoLibre's active user metrics to see if Meli+ is helping with adoption since its launch in Q3 2023. Moreover, the company's operating income has soared over the last few years. Ideally it can keep soaring as the business grows, but it's possible Meli+ eats into profits even as it drives adoption. That's something for investors to closely monitor as well.\nOverall, MercadoLibre stock is a buy, and Meli+ has the potential to drive the next chapter of the company's long-term growth.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and MercadoLibre made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 29, 2024\n\u00a0\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Text": "Wall Street could hardly be more excited about tech stocks right now, especially those with exposure to popular growth spaces like artificial intelligence (AI) and enterprise services. These investments rallied in 2023 into 2024 on falling fears about a recession developing this year. Companies in these niches are reporting faster sales gains and improving earnings power, two key factors supporting market-beating shareholder returns.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) are two excellent examples. The companies have different approaches but have each identified e-commerce and merchant services as huge long-term growth avenues. Against that backdrop, let's look at which impressive stock would make the better long-term buy for investors today.\nAmazon is a huge business, and as so its growth rate is limited by that massive size. Sales rose 14% in the fourth quarter, improving to $170 billion from $149 billion a year ago. Compare that to Shopify's blazing 24% revenue increase in the same period (with sales landing at $2.1 billion). Put another way, Amazon gained 3 times more revenue year-over-year last quarter than Shopify generated in the past full year.\nYet Shopify's smaller footprint is an advantage when it comes to sales growth opportunities. Most Wall Street pros are expecting Shopify to keep expanding at a 20%-plus rate in 2024, or about double Amazon's projected pace. In relative terms, it's clear which one is the faster-growing stock.\nLook closer, though, and you'll see a key difference between Amazon's two main sales categories. Its e-commerce segment expanded at a less-than-10% rate while the services division, which now accounts for 55% of sales, rose at a 15% rate last quarter. While its e-commerce unit is constrained by its size, Amazon still has a huge growth target around the enterprise web services industry.\nAmazon is the clear winner in this matchup with respect to its finances. Start with the fact that the company is extremely profitable, having generated $37 billion of operating income over the past year compared to Shopify's $1.4 billion of losses. Yet Amazon's cash flow trends are even more impressive and point to potentially significant profitability increases in 2024 and beyond.\nAn 80%-plus increase in operating cash flow in 2023 resulted from a new focus on efficiency that could push Amazon's profit margin toward the double digits. Shopify briefly achieved a 12% profitability rate, for context, before its margin sank into negative territory in 2022 and 2023. The good news is that Shopify is on track to return to profitability this year, but it's anyone's guess whether its margins can rise back toward sustainable double-digit rates over the next few years.\nAs you might expect, Shopify's stock is valued at a big premium that reflects Wall Street's enthusiasm for the company. You'll have to pay 15 times sales for this business. That's far above Amazon's price-to-sales ratio of 3. It is also much more than you'd pay for the highly diversified, established, and profitable company like Microsoft, for example. That business is valued at just over 13 times revenue.\nMany investors, then, will prefer to have Amazon in their portfolio over Shopify. You'll expose yourself to much less risk thanks to that lower valuation. Furthermore, Amazon's ample cash flow and profits are attractive. The two growth stocks are likely to be setting sales and earnings records in a few years. But Amazon has more going for it as an investment opportunity right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Institutional investors more frequently benchmark their performance against the S&P 500.\nAs well as dominating online retail, the Seattle company is a major player in cloud computing, entertainment and other industries.\n\"Amazon is almost a hybrid name. It's one of the names that falls into different categories. It in many ways exemplifies what the Dow stands for in terms of representing commerce across the United States,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nThe change takes effect at the open of trading on Monday.\nWalmart will remain part of the Dow, although its upcoming three-for-one stock split, effective after market close on Friday, will reduce that retailer's weight in the index.\nThe Dow is weighted based on the share prices of its components, not on each company's overall market value.\nAdditionally, Uber Technologies will join the Dow Jones Transportation Average, replacing JetBlue Airways Corp, giving that index exposure to the ride-hailing industry, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.\nAmazon's addition to the Dow is the first since 2020, when Salesforce, Amgen and Honeywell International replaced Exxon Mobil, Pfizer and Raytheon Technologies.\nWalgreens joined the Dow in 2018, replacing General Electric.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewih in Oakland, Calif, Caroline Valetkevitch in New York and Bhanvi Satija in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai and Christopher Cushing)\n"

        "Title": "Is Amazon a distributor?",
        "Author": "  Michael Baudendistel ",
        "Text": "Another government agency zeros in on Amazon Marketplace\nMost everyone who shops online buys from Amazon, but, presumably, few shoppers give much thought as to whether the products are being purchased from the retailer itself or one of the sellers on the Amazon Marketplace (AM). AM, which represents 60% of Amazon\u2019s sales, is the portion of the e-commerce giant where Amazon facilitates sales of products owned by third parties without taking ownership of inventory. Unless shoppers receive the annoying \u201cSee All Buying Options\u201d message (which they rarely care to see), it\u2019s not clear if an item is being sold by a Marketplace seller. In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon for illegally abusing monopoly power \u2014 the agency\u2019s complaints largely centered around treatment of AM sellers, such as whether sellers should be required to use Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers and transportation network to qualify for Prime and \u201cwin the buy box.\u201d I interviewed an expert on that topic in October who had mixed thoughts on the FTC\u2019s complaint. I also recommend reading this Seattle Times article, which provides a summary and next steps.\nNow, Amazon Marketplace is reportedly coming under fire from a different angle \u2014 this time from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is said to be working on an order to classify Amazon as a distributor. That\u2019s important because it would make the online retailer responsible for the safety of products sold on Amazon Marketplace and would make the online retailer responsible for product recalls. Such an order would create additional compliance costs, and the retailer may have to more aggressively vet Marketplace sellers. An order could encourage Amazon to reduce its third-party seller ranks and scale back its product selection \u2014 that could help the more reputable sellers that would remain on Marketplace. An order would also likely have implications for other online marketplaces, such as eBay or Walmart Marketplace, a growing channel that is similar to Amazon\u2019s third-party offering.\nAny Amazon haters will enjoy the Amazon comments in this lecture from author Cory Doctorow. I can\u2019t speak to his credibility \u2014 all I can say is that he does not exactly see the world through rose-colored glasses. The obvious counterpoints are: Most consumers love the convenience of Amazon, most U.S. households happily pay for Prime, Prime has a 91% satisfaction rate (what else is that high?), and it has a very low cancellation rate. If Amazon really is taking advantage of consumers, the public is too dumb to know it.\nRob Haddock describes why Coke aspires to be a Shipper of Choice\nI recommend reading Rob Haddock\u2019s (Group Director, Transportation Strategy at Coca-Cola North America) article on how to become, and why it pays to be, a Shipper of Choice. In short, he believes that many shippers do not fully appreciate the nuances of moving their freight \u2014 those can be idiosyncrasies related to their lanes and/or service requirements. But, carriers fully understand how less-tangible factors contribute to or detract from their bottom lines. To be a Shipper of Choice, beneficial cargo owners should take steps to help their carriers\u2019 efficiency and compensate them for any inefficiencies. Here are a few of Haddock\u2019s pieces of advice:\nDon\u2019t rely too heavily on rating tools. While rating tools provide a convenient gauge of market rates in a particular lane, they have important limitations and do not consider inefficiencies that may be inherent to serving the shipper in question.\nShippers must provide accurate volume projections \u2014 they are critical to optimize carriers\u2019 drive time and reduce empty miles.\nShippers should maintain relationships with a set of core carriers and look to utilize those carriers at all points in the freight cycle. That will naturally lead to improved compliance with the added benefit that the carriers will fully grasp the shippers\u2019 service requirements.\nIntermodal contract rates to be lower y/y during the first half\nOn their respective earnings calls, domestic intermodal providers J.B. Hunt and Hub Group told analysts to expect intermodal pricing to be down year over year in the first half of this year. That is consistent with the year-to-date data contained in SONAR via the IMCRPM1.USA ticker (shown above), which is an average of intermodal contract rates, excluding fuel surcharges. Year to date, SONAR shows average intermodal contract rates down 9% y/y and down 13% on a two-year stack versus 2022. Some intermodal carriers expect a turn in rates later this year \u2014 Hub Group\u2019s management said it expects rates to be up slightly y/y in the second half. Progress toward meeting that expectation can be monitored in the same SONAR data set, which is a daily series on a two-week lag. Risks to positive intermodal rates in the second half include a truckload market that may remain loose, potential continued domestic container availability (a measure of domestic intermodal capacity) and potential rail service disruptions.\nTo subscribe to The Stockout, FreightWaves\u2019 CPG and retail newsletter, click here or click here to see episodes of The Stockout show.\nThe post Is Amazon a distributor? appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.23%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.14%.\nHeading into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 10.97% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.63% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.2% in that time.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Amazon in its forthcoming earnings report. On that day, Amazon is projected to report earnings of $0.81 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 161.29%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $142.39 billion, indicating a 11.8% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.06 per share and revenue of $641.11 billion. These totals would mark changes of +40% and +11.54%, respectively, from last year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Amazon. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 10.81% higher. Amazon is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Amazon is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 43.5. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 17.58.\nWe can also see that AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.55. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Commerce industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.57 as trading concluded yesterday.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 145, putting it in the bottom 43% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Many of them were in the e-commerce giant\u2019s retail operations, including a little over 30 more people who are losing their jobs with its Buy With Prime business this year.\nThat has done wonder\u2019s for the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\u201cOver the past year or so, we believe that Amazon has been highly disciplined in getting its house in order by cutting out initiatives and operations that were not delivering the numbers,\u201d GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. \u201cThis has been invaluable in permitting margin expansion and improved profitability.\u201d\nThat included the operation supporting voice assistant Alexa, which downsized in November.

        "Text": "Some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest investors made new bets on technology giants in the fourth quarter, loading up on stakes in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA), and Nvidia (NVDA).\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), however, did not. The conglomerate trimmed its holdings in Apple (AAPL) and HP (HPE) while adding to its stakes in oil giants Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). There was at least one additional investment Berkshire kept confidential for now.\nThe details about these new bets made in the fourth quarter emerged this week in a series of filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Large institutional investors are required to make these disclosures on a quarterly basis, showing what they bought and sold.\nWhat the latest batch showed is that many piled into tech names at the end of 2023.\nA hedge fund run by Michael Burry \u2014 who famously shorted subprime mortgages during the 2008 financial crisis and became a central figure in Michael Lewis\u2019s 2010 book \"The Big Short\" \u2014 added 35,000 shares of Alphabet and 30,000 shares of Amazon. That fund, Scion Capital, also boosted bets on Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com.\nMany hedge funds also gravitated to the stock of Nvidia, the dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\nBridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund firm, increased its stake in Nvidia by 458% as it added more than 220,000 shares.\nIt also increased its position in Alphabet by more than 465,000 shares, making it the fund\u2019s 12th-largest position as of the end of December, and added a small stake in Apple.\nAnother hedge fund, AQR, increased its stake in Nvidia by 22%. But it trimmed its holdings in Apple and Microsoft, its two largest positions, by 5% and 4%, respectively.\nBerkshire sold just 1% of its holdings in Apple, or 10 million shares, leaving it with a huge stake of more than 950 million shares.\nApple has had a rough start to 2024 as it juggled downgrades to its stock price, major changes to its App Store policies, and a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business. These challenges mounted as it launched the ambitious Vision Pro headset.\nOne other notable investor pared back its exposure to Apple in the fourth quarter: the Soros Fund.\nThe outfit started by billionaire investor George Soros and now run by his son closed out a short position and zeroed out of its underlying holdings in the tech giant.\nSome of these same investors made some notable bets on the banking industry, especially a regional lender that is currently under a lot of scrutiny: New York Community Bank (NYCB).\nThe Soros Fund, AQR, and Millennium Management all increased their exposure to NYCB, which surprised Wall Street on Jan. 31 by slashing its dividend and reporting a net quarterly loss of $252 million.\nIt is not known what these funds did with their stakes between the end of the fourth quarter and now.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misnamed Millennium Management.

        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Less leasing demand for freighter aircraft significantly contributed to a 12% reduction in adjusted core operating profit at Air Transport Services Group during 2023, including a 20% decline in the fourth quarter, and to management\u2019s decision to further slash the budget for investment in new equipment.\nLower revenue and higher costs for ATSG\u2019s transportation segment, especially passenger airline Omni International, also weighed on earnings.\nThe cargo-oriented aviation company gave a sober outlook, saying in Monday\u2019s results that adjusted earnings are expected to fall an additional 10% this year, from $562 million to $506 million, absent potential new lease signings, with capital spending lowered to $410 million.\nATSG (NASDAQ: ATSG) last year responded to investor concerns about overspending in the midst of a down cycle for airfreight by cutting $65 million from planned capital expenditures for used widebody jets and having them modified to carry main-deck cargo. In November, ATSG shrank the 2024 capital budget to $505 million. The capital spending plan is now $380 million less than the company spent last year. Most of the reduction ($330 million) reflects fewer aircraft being purchased and sent to airframe repair shops to become freighters, as well as fewer expected engine overhauls.\nThe biggest drag on financial returns was the acceleration in lease returns of Boeing 767-200 freighters by primary customer Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) which reduced adjusted earnings, excluding taxes, loans and capital expenses, in the leasing subsidiary by $33 million last year. ATSG removed 10 of the cargo jets from service and sold five of them, as well as three 767-300s.\nThe return by Amazon in April of an additional seven 767-200s and lower engine utilization will drive down 2024 earnings by $55 million, to $506 million.\n\nManagement said three 767-300 leases will also expire this year but didn\u2019t quantify the financial impact. The returned aircraft will offset the benefit from any new lease placements.\nAmazon didn\u2019t renew expiring leases for the 767-200s, and ATSG hasn\u2019t been able to place the aircraft with different clients because the aircraft are nearing the end of their useful life. Fourteen of the medium widebody freighters will remain in service, and the rate of removal will slow to two or three over the next few years.\n\u201cThese aircraft were in high demand as Amazon built its own air express network starting in 2015 and even more so during the pandemic when customers kept the aircraft in service longer than originally planned. While we always envision the market transitioning to the 767-300s from the -200s, the market softness has accelerated that process,\u201d said Joe Hete, who returned as CEO in November when the board lost confidence in Rich Corrado, during a Tuesday conference call with analysts. \u201cIn addition to the lower lease revenue, we also lose power-by-cycle engine revenue as the -200s are removed from service and the aircraft remaining in service fly fewer cycles.\u201d\nAdjusted earnings per share of 18 cents was 10 cents below analysts\u2019 consensus expectation.\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter slipped 3% year over year to $517 million. ATSG\u2019s full-year revenue ticked up 1% to $2.1 billion, due primarily to a full year of contributions from six new leases of 767-300s made in 2022, as well as partial-year contributions from 13 leased aircraft in 2023, including the company\u2019s first three Airbus A321 narrowbody freighters.\nPresident Mike Berger said ATSG recently received European Union approval for its A321 freighter conversion design and is now able to lease those aircraft into the European market. Passenger-to-freighter reconfiguration is a new line of business for ATSG. It outsources conversions for its widebody fleet but has partnered with an aerospace engineering company to modify aircraft for itself and other parties.\nPretax losses for the leasing segment were $11 million. Revenue for the year increased 6%, but it wasn\u2019t enough to offset increased expenses for interest and depreciation.\nAt the end of 2023, ATSG had 90 owned aircraft out on lease, one fewer than in 2022.\nTwenty-three aircraft were in, or awaiting, conversion to freighters at the end of 2023, including 14 767s, six A321s and three Airbus A330s \u2014 a new widebody aircraft for the company. It plans to acquire four 767-300s and five Airbus 330 aircraft this year as feedstock for cargo conversions.\nOmni\u2019s reduced passenger activity and lower cargo margins were behind a fourth-quarter pretax loss of $2 million in contract transportation versus a $26 million gain in 2022. Full-year pretax earnings were $32 million for 2023 and $95 million in 2022.\nOmni experienced a 12% decline in flying for the U.S. Department of Defense, primarily because of conflicts in the Middle East.\nFlight hours for the two cargo airlines, which mostly operate under contracts with express delivery carriers to provide aircraft, crews, maintenance and insurance, decreased 2% in the normally busier fourth quarter and were flat for the year. Both customers also provide a handful of planes for the all-cargo carriers to fly on their behalf. Management attributed the decrease to ABX Air, where short-term contracts to operate some international routes for DHL Express during the pandemic boom came to an end in the first quarter of 2923, said Hete.\nFlight activity at Air Transport International (ATI), which focuses on hauling packages for Amazon, was flat for 2023 but increased in the fourth quarter. The relative strength of the Amazon business comes against a backdrop of slower consumer shopping online and Amazon\u2019s transformation to a more regional fulfillment network that can be more easily served by truck.\nHete declared that collective bargaining with the ATI pilots on a new contract is unlikely to be completed this year, saying the two sides are far apart on terms. ATI spent about $70 million on pilot salaries in 2023.\nTalks, which have been underway for more than three and a half years, have broken down over pay, retirement benefits and work rules. ATI pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, last month asked the National Mediation Board to declare an impasse in contract negotiations and move the process to binding arbitration. In a Jan. 31 interview with FreightWaves, Capt. Mike Sterling, chair of the ATI Master Executive Council, accused ATSG of dragging its feet until 2026, when the Amazon transportation contract expires and can be renegotiated.\nThe pilots union on Thursday reiterated that experienced pilots continue to leave ATSG, which is replacing them with individuals who meet the lowest minimum qualifications. In 2023, 45% of the airline\u2019s 600 pilots quit the airline. So far in 2024, more than 30 pilots have left the carrier. The situation could eventually erode ATI\u2019s operational reliability and jeopardize relations with Amazon, the union claims.\n\u201cThe pilots of ATI have invested heavily in growing the airline since Amazon operations began in 2015. We delivered record reliability during the 2023 holiday season despite demanding schedules that deteriorate our quality of life \u2014 in an overwhelming demonstration of our commitment to Amazon. ATI pilots help generate more than $500 million in revenue for ATSG, yet management continues to ignore their responsibility to deliver the market-rate pilot agreement we have earned,\u201d Sterling said in a statement.\nATSG\u2019s 2024 outlook is for lower flight hours at its airline operations.\nThe airline\u2019s story is similar to Canadian counterpart Cargojet, which this week reported a fourth-quarter loss and also backpedaled on planned investments in new freighters. The main difference is that ATSG also leases out aircraft and is slowing fleet expansion rather than stopping altogether. Cargojet said, however, that\u00a0 shipping volumes have been strong so far this year after ending 2023 on a high note.\nWith less money devoted to aircraft investments, ATSG is expected to generate positive free cash flow this year.\nWall Street has punished ATSG\u2019s stock in the past year. It closed Wednesday trading at $12.19 per share, down from $22.97 on Aug. 4.\n\u201cWe\u2019re well positioned going forward with the assets that we have, the investments we\u2019ve already made to be able to react quickly if, and when, the market finally turns around, whether that\u2019s 2024 or 2025. \u2026 But the other [key] is execution on our part in terms of better performance overall. That\u2019s been a focus of mine since I came back in November, to have better execution on the part of all the operating units and a more conservative approach in terms of the capital spending,\u201d said Hete. \u201cSo I think all those things combined, a more balanced capital allocation strategy going forward after generating some free cash flow puts us in a better position to start moving the stock back up where it should be.\u201d\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\nPilots flying Amazon cargo say employer stalling contract talks\nCargojet sees strong volumes after 2023 fleet reversal\nJetran buys Cargojet rights for 777 freighter conversions\nCargo airlines throttle back on aircraft leases, ATSG says\nThe post Amazon\u2019s return of leased cargo jets hurts ATSG profit appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "An Amazon Prime membership almost seems like a necessity these days, as both online shopping and stay-at-home entertainment viewing have picked up dramatically in popularity. Many customers view the annual fee for an Amazon Prime membership as relatively inexpensive for what they get out of it.\nRead Next: I\u2019m a Financial Advisor: I\u2019d Invest My First $5,000 in These 6 StocksDiscover More: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nYet, in spite of all the benefits an Amazon Prime membership provides, there\u2019s no doubt that an investment in Amazon stock would have been a much better use of that money, particularly in the first year that Amazon Prime debuted.\nHere\u2019s a look at how much money you would have earned if you put your annual Amazon Prime membership fee into Amazon stock instead.\nSponsored: Owe the IRS $10K or more? Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.\nWhen Amazon Prime first launched in 2005, it cost members $79 per year. The price has jumped since then: first to $99, then to $119, and now to its current price of $139.\nOn February 2nd, 2005, the day Amazon Prime was introduced, the price of Amazon stock was $2.09. For the price of an Amazon Prime membership at the time, customers could have instead purchased about 38 shares of Amazon stock.\nFor You: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nAs mentioned above, the cost of an Amazon Prime membership has jumped from $79 to $139, a jump of about 75%. This means that today\u2019s customers pay about 75% more than the original price of an Amazon Prime membership in 2007.\nBut for those wise investors who instead bought Amazon stock in 2005 instead of subscribing to Amazon Prime, the results have been nothing short of incredible.\nAs of Sept. 5, shares of Amazon stock traded at $136. In other words, the $79 that Amazon Prime subscribers could have instead invested in Amazon stock would now be worth $5,168, representing a profit of about $5,089.\nIf those investors had been lucky enough to sell out at Amazon\u2019s all-time high price of $3,773.08, those shares would have been worth $143,377.04.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for a stock investment to outperform a common expense. After all, expenses represent consumption, whereas investment offers the potential to generate profits over time.\nHowever, the unbelievable performance of Amazon stock over the years certainly shows that owning a portion of the company is a much wiser move than simply using its products. With $143,377 in profits, investors in Amazon stock at the start of 2005 could afford more than 1,031 years of Amazon Prime membership at the current price of $139 annually.\nOf course, just like Amazon stock was a better bet than Amazon Prime membership in 2005, analysts feel that Amazon\u2019s stock price can continue to run. Currently, analysts have a consensus \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock, with an average monthly price target of $175.\nWhile no one is suggesting that you should give up your Amazon Prime, if the analysts are correct in their predictions, adding some money to Amazon stock as well could more than pay for the cost of your annual membership.\nLaura Beck contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nFrugal People Love the 6 to 1 Grocery Shopping Method: Here's Why It Works\nSocial Security: Can Debt Collectors Garnish Your SSI Payments?\nThe 6 Smartest Things to Do With Your Tax Refund\n7 Ways Fraudsters Are Trying to Scam People in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Rich Would You Be If You Invested in Amazon Stock Instead of an Amazon Prime Membership?\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nAnother factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Amazon (AMZN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AMZN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nAmazon's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Amazon's main business drivers.\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.Its online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company\u2019s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish footprint in physical grocery supermarket space. \nAmazon also enjoys dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin generating businesses. \nAmazon has also become a household name with its Alexa powered Echo devices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa is helping the company sell products and services.\nRevenues were $574.8 billion in 2023. The company reports revenue under three broad heads\u2014North America, International and AWS, which generated 61.4%, 22.8% and 15.8% of total revenues, respectively.\nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, Amazon targets three categories of customers\u2014consumers, sellers and website developers. Consumers are offered variety, convenience and free delivery of goods displayed on the company\u2019s websites.The agreements with sellers are varied, enabling them to use the company\u2019s websites to either sell their merchandise directly, or redirect customers to the sellers\u2019 own branded websites. In case of the latter arrangement, Amazon earns a fee for the sales thus generated.\nCompetition comes in the form of traditional retailers, other online retailers, media companies, web portals, search engines, e-commerce companies and cloud computing service providers.\nBottom Line\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Amazon a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in February 2014 would be worth $10,069.21, or a 906.92% gain, as of February 23, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 177.03% and gold's return of 47.01% over the same time frame.\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for AMZN.\nAmazon\u2019s fourth quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. The stock has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings remains tailwinds. Amazon\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, macroeconomic challenges remain concerns.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 10.67%, and there have been 15 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Costco vs. Amazon",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The global retail market generated $27 trillion in 2022 and is projected to hit $30 trillion this year, according to data from Statista. The industry is vast, including everything from grocery to consumer electronics, e-commerce, and more. As a result, it's not a bad idea to make a long-term investment in the space and benefit from its gradual development.\nWhile it might be tempting to invest in the industry through a market leader like Walmart, it's worth looking at companies with more international reach to potentially profit from the market's global footprint.\nCostco (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are attractive options. Both have operations in more than a dozen countries and are continuing to expand. Costco's unique wholesale business model has successfully traversed dozens of cultures and regions, winning over consumers with its low prices and subscription-based model.\nMeanwhile, Amazon has become a household name with the popularity of its online site and the many services included in its annual Prime membership.\nSo, let's take a closer look at these businesses and determine whether Costco or Amazon is a better stock to buy this February.\nCostco has come a long way since its founding 40 years ago. The retail giant has grown to 874 locations across 14 countries. The bulk of its stores are in the U.S., where the company ranks third among the nation's top 100 retailers (behind only Walmart and Amazon).\nYet, Costco's stock has massively outperformed its American rivals.\nThis table showcases the long-term value of Costco's shares, which have delivered more than double the growth of the most prominent U.S. retailers since 2019. Costco's annual revenue and operating income have soared 59% and 71%, respectively, in that same period, while free cash flow has climbed 162%.\nThe company is on a promising growth trajectory that looks unlikely to slow any time soon, with plans to open 31 new locations in 2024 after opening 23 last year.\nMoreover, Costco's annual membership has been instrumental in its success. In general, product sales don't amount to much in profits for many retailers. However, the company seemed to solve this issue with its annual subscription.\nIn fiscal 2023, Costco hit more than $6 billion in profits, with membership fees making up 73%. Alongside a 90% subscription renewal rate, the company will likely continue enjoying consistent gains for years.\nWhile Costco dominates wholesale grocery, Amazon is the biggest name in e-commerce. The retail giant's success in the industry has seen it become the world's fourth most valuable company, a spot it recently attained after its market cap surpassed Alphabet's last week.\nAmazon's shares have soared 11% since Feb. 1, when it posted earnings for its fourth quarter of 2023. During the quarter, revenue climbed 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by nearly $4 billion.\nOver the last year, the company has delivered impressive growth in its e-commerce segments. Macroeconomic headwinds hit Amazon's retail business hard in 2022, prompting it to introduce a string of cost-cutting measures. And the company has more than made up for its temporary downturn.\nImprovements are most apparent in its North American segment, which achieved more than $6 billion in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023, a massive increase from the $240 million in losses it posted in the year-ago quarter.\nMeanwhile, Amazon's free cash flow has risen 904% year over year to $32 billion. Alongside heavy investment in artificial intelligence through its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, the company has an exciting outlook. \nCostco and Amazon hold powerful positions in retail, with both likely to prove to be assets to any portfolio over the long term. However, the chart below indicates Amazon might have more room for growth over the next two years.\nThis chart shows Costco's earnings could reach $18 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Amazon's are expected to hit just under $7 per share. Multiplying those figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Costco's 45 and Amazon's 40) gives a stock price of $810 for Costco and $272 for Amazon.\nBased on their current positions, these projections would see Costco's stock rise 14% by fiscal 2026, while Amazon's would increase by 58%.\nAs a result, Amazon is a no-brainer if the choice is between these two stocks. The company is crushing it in e-commerce and is home to a highly lucrative cloud business that could make it one of the best growth stocks right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Costco Wholesale wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Amazon is an e-commerce colossus serving hundreds of millions of customers with rock-bottom prices and fast delivery. However, its status as online retail\u2019s most successful company isn\u2019t what's behind its rocketing stock price.\nInstead, investors have piled into Amazon stock on optimism that it will benefit from a surge in spending on artificial intelligence. Amazon Web Services is the market-share leader in cloud data solutions, making it ground zero for AI research and development.\nThe potential to profit from demand associated with training and operating AI apps has helped Amazon\u2019s share price swell 85% in the past year and 14% year-to-date.\nThe rapid runup is good news for investors, but it does raise the question: What happens now?\nIn November\u00a0Real Money Pro\u2019s Bruce Kamich calculated a $200 price target for Amazon shares. They haven\u2019t reached Kamich\u2019s target, but the gains have been significant enough to prompt him to update his analysis, including a revamped price outlook.\nBloomberg/Getty Images\nJeff Bezos founded Amazon as an online bookseller in his garage in 1994. Today, the company sells almost everything everywhere, competing fiercely for market share against major retailers including Walmart, Target and Costco.\nE-commerce accounts for the bulk of Amazon\u2019s quarterly sales, but AWS cloud solutions make the most profit.\nAWS was only a budding business 15 years ago. Nowadays, it generates nearly $100 billion in annualized revenue by helping companies and governments store, protect, analyze and access data in the cloud.\nThe need for workers to access data remotely during covid lockdowns accelerated opportunities for AWS to embed itself more deeply with its customers. Those relationships are paying off this year as users investigate how to make the most of AI.\nFor example, finance companies are using AI to hedge risks, health-care companies are evaluating AI\u2019s ability to improve drug development, and retailers are seeking to use it to prevent theft.\nSeemingly, everyone is exploring how AI, including large-language models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, may help them.\nThat\u2019s a boon to Amazon because much of the training and use of AI apps is happening on its servers.\nIn Q4, AWS revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $24.2 billion. Revenue in the third quarter increased\u00a0 12% from a year earlier to $23.1 billion.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy thinks AWS has a long AI runway.\n\"There\u2019s a lot of growth in front of AWS; I\u2019m very optimistic about it,\u201d said Jassy last year. \"Customers want to bring the models to their data, not the other way around. And much of that data resides in AWS.\"\nAWS market share in cloud solutions is 32%, above Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud market share of 23% and 10%, respectively.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is composed of America's largest and most influential companies.\nThe holdings in the Dow 30 don\u2019t change very often (the last additions were Amgen, Honeywell and Salesforce in 2020), so Amazon\u2019s promotion into the Dow on Feb. 26 is capturing attention.\nThe opportunity to add Amazon to the Dow presented itself when Dow member Walmart split its shares. A price-weighted index, the lower price resulting from Walmart\u2019s 3:1 split, created some wiggle room.\nMore Wall Street Analysts:\nAnalyst who correctly warned Tesla stock could fall unveils new target\nAnalysts race for new Palo Alto Networks price targets as shares plunge\nAnalyst who forecast Nvidia stock could exceed $750 revamps target\nTo make more space, the Dow decided to jettison Walgreens Boots Alliance\u00a0 (WBA) , the nation\u2019s largest pure-play pharmacy chain.\nAmazon was a natural fit for inclusion because it already boasts a $1.8 trillion market cap, and its reach includes retail and technology. Following its addition, Amazon now accounts for about 3% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nBruce Kamich is a technical analyst who has professionally analyzed price and volume charts and indicators for more than 50 years.\nHis experience using technical analysis enabled him to correctly be bullish on Amazon shares last summer, turn bearish on them in September, and calculate a price target of more than $200 in November when the shares were trading below $150.\nNow that Amazon shares are near $175, Kamich recently updated his analysis, resulting in a new target price.\nAmazon shares \"have advanced since early 2023, but trading volume has been decreasing for more than a year,\u201d wrote Kamich. \u201cOld-time chart readers like myself would rather see trading volume increase in the direction of the trend.\u201d\nKamich also noted that while the on-balance volume, a measure of up minus down day volume, is positive, it\u2019s only \u201cback to the levels seen in 2021 and early 2022.\u201d He\u2019s also somewhat concerned that the moving average convergence divergence oscillator, a momentum indicator, has \u201cstarted to narrow.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not very bullish because it could suggest that Amazon\u2019s rally is running out of steam.\nNevertheless, Kamich\u2019s point-and-figure chart price calculations offer Amazon shareholders reassurance. Using a daily and weekly P&F chart, Kamich calculated Amazon price targets of $199 and $223, respectively.\nThe $223 price target is particularly alluring, but investors should remember that P&F charts don't predict time frames, and there's no guarantee that price targets will be met.\nKamich also says that if Amazon trades below $166, the daily price target may weaken, so investors will want to keep tabs on the shares to see how they act in the coming weeks.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n"

        "Title": "Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock Up Recently?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 22% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's  ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n15% = US$30b \u00f7 US$202b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nTo begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 19% does temper our expectations. However, the moderate 5.7% net income growth seen by Amazon.com over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.\nAs a next step, we compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 13% in the same period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is AMZN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AMZN is currently mispriced by the market.\nAmazon.com doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\nOverall, we feel that Amazon.com certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a respectable rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

In this regard, Amazon intends to invest more than $5 billion in Mexico over 15 years.Notably, AWS Mexico (Central) Region, which will be comprised three availability zones, is expected to aid AWS in addressing the growing demand for cloud services in Latin America.The region will help AWS in delivering low latency and offering access to its robust cloud services portfolio and technology, including AI, machine learning, data analytics and the Internet of Things to customers.Further, it will allow customers to run critical workloads seamlessly and store data securely in Mexico.Thus, the latest move is expected to enable AWS to gain traction among startups, enterprises, no-profit and government organizations.Already Aeromexico, Banco Santander Mexico, Cinepolis and Vector Casa de Bolsa, to name a few, have shown interest in the new Mexico region.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nIn addition to AWS Mexico (Central) Region, the company recently launched of its second infrastructure region in Canada - AWS Canada West (Calgary) AWS. This is located in Calgary.Apart from North America, AWS\u2019 increasing Regions in Europe remain a plus. The company operates seven AWS Regions and 21 availability zones across Europe in Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm and Zurich.Also, AWS\u2019 growing interest in the Asia-Pacific region remains noteworthy. It plans to launch an AWS infrastructure region in Malaysia, in which it strives to invest around $6 billion by 2037 and support job creation in the country.The company\u2019s launch of its second infrastructure region in Melbourne, Australia, and an infrastructure region in Israel, located in Tel Aviv, namely, AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region remains noteworthy..Currently, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions. It further plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.\nAn increasing number of regions and availability zones across the globe is likely to drive AWS\u2019 customer momentum, which in turn will likely boost its financial performance and aid Amazon in capitalizing on the prospects of the global cloud market. This is likely to instill investors\u2019 optimism in the stock in the near term.In the fourth quarter of 2023, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of total sales), which grew 13% year over year.Moreover, AWS has been the key catalyst for Amazon whose shares have gained 83.7% in the past year.This apart, Amazon\u2019s aggressive expansion efforts are expected to continue aiding its competitive prowess against its strong peers, such as Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google. Both companies are also leaving no stone unturned to boost presence in this promising market.Microsoft Azure became the key driver for Microsoft. MSFT is currently riding on the robust adoption of Microsoft Azure\u2019s cloud offerings. Microsoft Azure's increasing number of availability zones and regions across the globe and its strength in the consumption-based business are likely to continue driving MSFT's cloud momentum in the near term.Similarly, Google Cloud contributes substantially to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position.Nevertheless, AWS, with its strengthening global infrastructure, continues to maintain its dominant position in the cloud market.Per the latest Synergy Research Group data, AWS accounted for 31% of the global cloud infrastructure services market in fourth-quarter 2023, maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.Microsoft Azure, the second-largest cloud service provider, accounted for 24% of the market.Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud acquired 11% share of the market, making it the third-largest cloud provider.\nCurrently, Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector is CrowdStrike CRWD, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

        "Text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nThe two biggest retailers online and in real life are relying on a reimagined product to sell: advertising space.\nWalmart (WMT) this week confirmed plans to extend the reach of its ads business through a $2.3 billion acquisition of smart TV maker Vizio, wielding an array of screens to give Walmart and advertisers in-home tools \"to connect to customers\" (surveillance?) and another surface for boosting e-commerce.\nThe Vizio play aligns with Walmart's aggressive advertising build-out. The retailer is poised to grow its ad revenue by nearly 40% this year, according to forecasts by Insider Intelligence. That's more than any other company.\nAmong the businesses expected to significantly expand their ad sales in 2024 are others in the grocery and retail space seeking the higher margins of digital ads \u2014 Instacart (CART), Target (TGT), and, you guessed it, Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 turning their online platforms into another system for steering user attention and money. It's a natural evolution for these companies, which have also become powerful search engines, hosts of user-generated content (reviews! usernames!), and content publishers over the years.\nWalmart's move to capture more data and advertising power comes as Amazon grew its ads business 27% year over year, according to its most recent quarterly report.\nThe market's deference to Big Tech and the eagerness to turn legacy and digital operations into ad portals have been revealed in other ways. Next week Amazon, the No. 3 player in the digital ads world behind Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META), will join the elite members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\"Reflecting the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA,\" said S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the 30-stock gauge. Or, as S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt bluntly put it on Yahoo Finance Live, the index added Amazon because it \"needs to stay relevant.\"\nOut is Walgreens (WBA), and in is the Big Tech hydra of e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and online advertising.\nAmazon is becoming an ad tech giant while the nation's largest retailer is busy turning itself into a tech company. \"Digital advertising is the future of Walmart,\" Oliver Chen, a senior research analyst at TD Cowen, told Yahoo Finance Live.\nAnd while this may sound somewhat silly at first glance, it's yet another way a company can gain advantage through vertical integration: owning the store and the billboards. Or in this case, the screens that function as both.\n\"There is a marketplace opportunity in third-party selling, and there's also a big digital advertising opportunity,\" Chen said. Vizio's smart TV operating system claims 18 million accounts.\nIn another sign of the times, the ride-hailing giant Uber will replace JetBlue Airways in the Dow Jones Transportation Average so the index can gain exposure to the ridesharing industry.\nBut as Wall Street has made clear, it's not enough for a transportation company powered by algorithms and human drivers to do business as a tech platform. The ad dollars from users scrolling for Chinese food or riding home are just sitting there.\nDuring the company's most recent earnings call earlier this month, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he expects Uber's advertising business to exceed $1 billion in 2024.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": "  Chris Morris ",
        "Text": "Amazon customers who opt to continue with the new ad-supported Prime Video are going to have to deal with more than commercials as they watch programming. The service has reportedly removed access to Dolby features that enhance the video and audio quality of programs for its lower-tier members, as well.\nPrime Video members on the ad-supported plan no longer have access to Dolby Vision high dynamic range (HDR) video and Dolby Atmos sound. To enable those, you\u2019ll need to pay the extra $3 a month, which also does away with the ads.\nThe features, which are available on several modern televisions, were not enabled when streaming via an ad-supported account, but did show up when the same program was watched on an ad-free one. German tech publication\u00a04kfilme\u00a0first spotted the change and the action was confirmed by\u00a0Forbes.\nDolby\u2019s HDR video is a technology that adds image data to onscreen pictures, resulting in a better picture quality. Dolby Atmos is widely considered the most immersive home-based version of surround sound and a go-to for home theater buffs.\nForbes notes that ad-supported customers still have access to HDR10+, an alternative HDR technology.\nAmazon\u2019s decision to add advertising to its base tier has angered some of its subscribers. While Disney, Netflix and Max all offer ad-based subscription levels, Amazon did not introduce its version as a lower-priced option for subscribers, choosing instead to begin including them in the base subscription model and charging a premium to avoid them.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Arriana McLymore and Greg Bensinger ",
        "Text": "By Arriana McLymore and Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com has begun rolling out a new artificial intelligence assistant that is meant to address shoppers\u2019 product questions, but the feature raises as many questions as it answers.\nRufus, as the software is known, will help users, according to Amazon, by guiding them to the toaster ovens or dinosaur toys that best fit their needs. Yet Amazon has a history of steering customers towards products that most benefit Amazon, either because they are more profitable or are backed by advertising dollars, according to the Federal Trade Commission's pending 2023 antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.\nThe FTC accused Amazon of \"biasing Amazon\u2019s search results to preference Amazon\u2019s own products over ones that Amazon knows are of better quality.\" Further, the FTC alleges the Seattle firm operates a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d system, giving top billing for the products on which marketers were willing to spend the most. The company has denied the claims and said it will contest the suit in court.\nAmazon's general counsel said in 2023 that the FTC \"is wrong on the facts and the law,\" and that its practices \"have helped to spur competition and innovation across the retail industry.\"\nLike for other generative AI services, the algorithm behind Rufus is a closely held secret and Amazon declined to discuss how it operates. It offered some clues, including a press release, that said it is trained using Amazon\u2019s product catalog, reviews, information from the web and question and answer sections.\nBut Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst, said Amazon would be turning money away if it didn\u2019t ostensibly open Rufus\u2019 results up to advertisers. \u201cYou\u2019ll most likely get sponsored results,\u201d he said. \u201cAdvertising drives retail and Amazon is no different \u2013 why do you think they are generating tens of billions of dollars in advertising a year?\u201d\nThe company on Thursday reported a 27% jump in ad sales in last year\u2019s fourth quarter to $14.7 billion.\nAt least initially, Rufus doesn\u2019t appear to be influenced by advertising. Gil Luria, a D.A. Davidson senior software analyst, said that was likely necessary to build trust with consumers. \u201cIf they lose your faith in how they answer, you're not going to ask them anymore,\" Luria said.\nADVERTISING AND CONSUMER CHOICES\nYet the company has time and again allowed advertising to creep into its recommendations.\nConsumers may have once believed that an \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice\u201d designation indicated a review or testing process, but Amazon once granted that badge to marketers who were willing to pay for it, according to a 2019 Digiday story citing an Amazon internal deck from 2017.\nAmazon has denied that the company has ever allowed sponsored results in \"Amazon's Choice\" and said the label relies primarily on criteria such as reviews, shipping speed and price, according to a company spokesperson.\nEurope\u2019s top antitrust enforcer Margrethe Vestager said Amazon\u2019s ability to limit access to the \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice\u201d badge was one reason for her objection to the company\u2019s planned takeover of Roomba-maker iRobot. Amazon walked away from the deal last month.\nAnd Amazon previously allowed marketers to place products in customers\u2019 online baby registries without their knowledge, a Wall Street Journal investigation found. It has since ended the practice.\nAmazon.com search results included nine sponsored listings on average, a study by Profitero from 2020 to 2021 found, twice the amount as Walmart and four times that of Target.\nJim Tierney, Chief Investment Officer of Concentrated US Growth Equities at AllianceBernstein, said he saw real promise in Rufus \"if you actually have some kind of an AI conversational shopper.\u201d\n\u201cThat just means more engagement and more conversion, which means more revenues and more units (sold),\" Tierney said.\nBut Amazon offered few clues in rolling out Rufus to select customers. In a call with investors, CEO Andy Jassy said Rufus \u201clets customers discover items in a very different way than they have been able to on e-commerce websites.\u201d\nAmazon in a blog post showed how the software might respond to a query about a particular pickleball paddle\u2019s worthiness for beginners. \u201cThis paddle is a great option for beginners,\u201d the software replied, according to a screenshot. \u201cThe large sweet spot helps beginner players get the ball over the net consistently.\u201d In another example it displayed Tyrannosaurus Rex toys for a query about best toys for a \u201cdinosaur obsessed 5-year old.\u201d\nThe company said Rufus is trained using Amazon\u2019s product catalog, reviews, information from the web, and question and answer sections.\nHowever Rufus evolves, Luria said Amazon has an edge over Google and Microsoft's AI applications because it has a rich trove of purchasing and personalized data that\u2019s quite an advantage at the checkout counter.\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York and Greg Bensinger in San Francisco; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

        "Text": "E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN joined the blue-chip index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA on Feb 26.The reshuffle reflects the ongoing shift in economic power from traditional brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce and technology-driven companies. The inclusion of Amazon in the Dow marks a significant milestone in the recognition of the e-commerce giant's influence and its role in the broader market.The shift was prompted by Walmart's WMT decision to execute a 3-to-1 stock split, which has reduced its stock's weighting in the index. The Dow is a price-weighted index. So, stocks that fetch higher prices are given more weight. Amazon's addition has increased consumer retail exposure within the index, alongside enhancing the representation of various other business sectors that Amazon engages in, including cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence, among others (read: Walmart Soars on Earnings, Dividend & Vizio Deal: ETFs to Buy).Amazon took the 17th position in the index, while Walmart's weighting dropped to 26 from 17. UnitedHealth Group remained the most heavily weighted stock in the index. Amazon's entry into the Dow Jones is not just a symbolic change but a reflection of the evolving priorities and dynamics within the investment world. It signals a broader recognition of the value and impact of technology and e-commerce sectors, encouraging investors to perhaps rethink their investment approaches in light of these trends.While the Dow Jones is making new record highs, its performance is lagging behind the S&P and Nasdaq over the past year. The underperformance is due to the lack of exposure in tech stocks and the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies in particular. The Dow includes two of the Magnificent Seven \u2014 Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. Amazon will be the third. As such, the addition of Amazon will help Dow Jones catch up with the S&P 500 gains.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-02-19, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $62.04. It's currently trading at a price of $169.49. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -173.19%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$2.81\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.28%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n16.57\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n7.05\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n62.04\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $38.50. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -340.23%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Amazon\u00a0 (AMZN) \u00a0has a storied history from its humble origins as a book/music/video seller 25 years ago to its current status as a retail/technology colossus.\nThe company founded by Jeff Bezos has an iron-clad position in e-commerce and cloud services. Recall that the cloud refers to offsite storage of data and documents.\n\u201cIt has emerged as the clear e-commerce leader given its size and scale, which yield an unmatched selection of low-priced goods for consumers,\u201d wrote Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff.\n\u201cPrime ties Amazon\u2019s e-commerce efforts together and provides a steady stream of high-margin recurring revenue from customers who purchase more frequently from Amazon\u2019s properties.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s the cloud. \u201cThrough Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon is a clear leader in public cloud services,\u201d Romanoff said. \u201cAdditionally, the firm\u2019s advertising business is already large and continues to scale as ads have made their way into Amazon\u2019s streaming outlets.\u201d\nAmazon released its fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, and that led analysts to shift their outlooks for the company, including new price targets.\nTheStreet/Shutterstock\nThe earnings numbers beat Wall Street forecasts. Amazon reported that revenue jumped 14% to $170 billion in the fourth quarter from $149.2 billion a year earlier.\nRelated: Goldman Sachs predicts these 7 stocks will lead the way in 2024\nNet income rocketed to $10.6 billion, or $1 a share, from $278 million, or 3 cents a share. Strong holiday sales helped boost the numbers.\nAWS revenue grew 13%. While that figure didn\u2019t blow analysts\u2019 socks off after stratospheric gains in past years, it did beat the 12% gains of the prior two quarters. And AWS operating profit climbed 38%.\nA 27% revenue increase for Amazon\u2019s advertising segment impressed analysts. \u201cAmazon\u2019s advertising growth continues to outpace that of its large Internet peers, albeit off of a smaller revenue base,\u201d Romanoff said.\nMeanwhile, \u201cimprovements in fulfillment and cost to serve continue to drive stronger-than-anticipated profitability in retail,\u201d he said.\nAmazon offered good news on costs too. Operating expenses climbed 7% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, which is half the growth rate of revenue.\nLooking forward, Amazon forecast revenue expansion of 8% to 13% this quarter from a year earlier. It also sees operating income increasing 67% to 150%.\nThe earnings report led a slew of stock analysts to lift their target price for Amazon. \u201cAfter several quarters of strong performance on the profitability front, we are raising our operating margin outlook by 160 basis points for 2024 and over the next several years,\u201d Romanoff said.\nMore From Wall Street Analysts:\nAnalyst who correctly predicted crude oil\u2019s rally has a new forecast\nVeteran fund money manager touts 'sleep-well-at-night' stocks\nTop analyst unveils new Tesla stock price target ahead of earnings\nThat led him to boost his fair value estimate for Amazon\u2019s stock to $185 from $155. It traded at $172.10 Friday.\nWedbush analysts Scott Devitt lifted his price target to $220 from $210.\nHis reasoning was similar to Romanoff\u2019s. \u201cThe magnitude of operating profit growth in the fourth quarter further validates the strength of Amazon's underlying margin trajectory,\u201d Devitt wrote in a report. \u201cWe see a clear path ahead to about a 10% operating margin in 2025.\u201d\nIn terms of e-commerce, \u201cAmazon achieved its fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023 while managing to reduce the cost to serve domestically by 45 cents per unit during the fourth quarter,\u201d Devitt said.\n\u201cThe shift to a regional fulfillment network and ongoing improvements in delivery speeds globally are unlocking incremental purchases from Prime members, and Amazon observed strong growth in everyday essential categories.\u201d\nAmong other analyst price-target changes,\nMorgan Stanley went to $200 from $185,\nBank of America went to $204 from $185,\nDeutsche Bank went to $200 from $175,\nBenchmark went to $200 from $175,\nStifel went to $200 from $175 and,\nNeedham went to $205 from $175.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\nThe author owns shares of Amazon.\n"

Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.\nBezos was a big thinker. Members of Amazon would bring ideas to him that were strong on their own, yet he encouraged them to take their ideas to even greater levels. Prospective business-minded individuals should not be afraid to think big even when they are still in the burgeoning stages of their growth.\nSecondly, Bezos is said to have the highest of standards, so much so that he was actually criticized for negatively affecting employee mental and physical health through his pressure-inducing expectations. That being said, he is lauded for this as the ambition and direction helped bring about the massive success of Amazon. Still, it might be prudent for leaders to temper just how intensely they stress their standards, as those working for them deserve respectful treatment.\nBezos was great with decision-making, particularly in the long term. While it might have seemed like tunnel vision at the offset, it was all about his determination in growing Amazon to be the best version of itself. Amazon Web Services, the current most profitable part of the company, began years after the early success of its focus on books. Moreover, that initial success reflects his ability to strategize in the short term, as well.\nFinally, Bezos is said to be \u201copen and curious.\u201d He would wait until the end of meetings before sharing his thoughts, meaning he was able to respond based on all of the relevant input. He was naturally invested in new ideas \u2014 his stance was that the best leaders actively search for other points of view that challenge their established beliefs.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Best New Dollar Tree Items That Are Worth Every Penny\nYou Can Get These 3 Debts Canceled Forever\n8 Signs You'll Retire Wealthy\n4 Reasons You Should Be Getting Your Paycheck Early, According to An Expert\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Jeff Bezos Harnessed 4 Unique Traits To Make Amazon a $1 Trillion Success \u2014 Can They Help Build Your Wealth?\n"

(AWS) \u2014 the cloud computing arm of Amazon \u2014 is investing $10 billion to build two giant data centers in Madison County.\nThe project is the largest economic development project in Mississippi\u2019s entire history and is expected to create at least 1,000 \u201chigh-paying, high-tech\u201d jobs by 2034.\nWhen signing legislation to finalize the record-shattering project on Jan. 30, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said: \u201cThis $10 billion private sector investment is proof that Mississippi can compete against the fiercest competition in economic development and win.

The tax breaks will continue if Amazon invests $500 million and adds 50 jobs every year.\nMississippi has also provided a $215 million loan to Madison County to assist with site infrastructure work, as well as a $44 million package, most of which is earmarked for job training.\nMaddie blasted Amazon for accepting corporate welfare \u2014 the 10-year tax exemption \u2014 in a state with \u201cthe highest rate of poverty in America.\u201d\nShe does make a fair point.

We\u2019re literally nearing the end of the game,\u201d said one of Maddie\u2019s commenters, referring to when there\u2019s only one player remaining in the game (in this case, corporate giant Amazon) who isn\u2019t bankrupt.\nHowever, another TikTok user pointed out: \u201cSounds like they\u2019re trying to get new jobs in Mississippi with that investment of warehouses.\u201d\nThat is very much the message that Amazon and the state of Mississippi are delivering. Upon announcing the landmark development, AWS Director of Economic Development, Roger Wehner said: \u201cWe are excited to expand our operations into Mississippi through this planned $10 billion investment, which will tap into the burgeoning tech sector across the state to create new, well-paying jobs and boost the state\u2019s Gross Domestic Product each year.\n\u201cWe look forward to delivering new workforce development opportunities and educational programs that support the next generation of talent across the Magnolia State.\u201d\nRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead.

        "Text": "Over the weekend investors were certainly digesting the quarterly results from Magnificent Seven players Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0last Friday. \u00a0\nOf course, Meta Platforms\u2019 stood out by announcing its first-ever dividend during its earnings release but all three were able to exceed their top and bottom line expectations. While Meta may have stolen the show on Friday, let\u2019s check out Amazon and Apple\u2019s quarterly results and see if now is a good time to buy stock in these iconic tech giants.\nAmazon Q4 Review \nRounding out its fiscal 2023 Amazon reported Q4 earnings of $1.01 per share which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus of $0.81 a share by 24%. Even better, Q4 earnings soared 380% from $0.21 a share in the comparative quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $169.96 billion beat estimates by 2% and leaped 14% YoY. Amazon produced Q4 net income of $10.6 billion which skyrocketed from the $300 million the e-commerce bohemoth brought in a year ago.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon attributed its very strong Q4 results to a record-breaking holiday shopping season and saw 13% and 17% growth in its North America and International segment sales respectively. In terms of its cloud services, Amazon\u2019s AWS segment sales were up 13% to $24.2 billion during Q4 but slightly missed estimates of $24.37 billion.\nStill, Amazon\u2019s total sales were up 12% in FY23 to $574.8 billion with net income of $30.4 billion climb swinging from a net loss of -$2.7 billion a year ago. This translated into annual earnings of $2.90 per share which skyrocketed 308% from $0.71 a share in 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple Q1 Review\nReporting its fiscal first quarter results of Friday, Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings of $2.18 per share was up 16% YoY to a new record high and topped the Zacks Consensus of $2.09 a share by 4%. Quarterly sales of $119.57 billion topped estimates by over 1% and rose 2% YoY. Apple reported net income of $33.92 billion which jumped 13% from the prior year quarter.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nApple\u2019s Q1 growth was fueled by iPhone sales and an all-time revenue record in its Services segment sales which includes Apple news, music, and TV along with its App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, and Apple Pay. iPhone sales came in at $69.7 billion and beat estimates by 1% although Services sales of $23.11 billion were still -1% short of the consensus of $23.39 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nFollowing their favorable quarterly results Amazon\u2019s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Apple lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The trend of positive earnings estimate revisions looks likely to continue for Amazon while investors may want to monitor Apple\u2019s warning of softer iPhone sales during the current quarter despite the company's immense\u00a0probability.\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Earnings season has arrived, providing fresh batches of figures to consider when expanding your portfolio.\nTwo of the major companies releasing results last week were Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Both have built immense brand loyalty with consumers and boast powerful positions in retail. Apple has almost unrivaled supremacy in consumer tech products. Amazon has similar dominance in e-commerce and the cloud market.\nSince 2019, Apple has soared by 349% and Amazon by 96%. While past growth is no guarantee of what's to come, these companies have solid long-term outlooks as they continue to expand in their respective industries. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon both beat Wall Street forecasts for earnings per share\u00a0 and revenue in their most recent quarters.\nBut is Apple or Amazon the better stock to buy right now?\nApple is coming out of a tricky year. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30, 2023), and revenue dipped by 3%. However, the results from its fiscal 2024 first quarter (which ended Dec. 31, 2023) showed signs that a recovery could be underway.\nDuring the quarter, Apple's net sales rose 2% year over year to $120 billion, beating analysts' expectations by more than $1 billion and breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Meanwhile, its earnings hit $2.18 per share compared to an expected $2.10 per share.\nYet, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business. Smartphone sales increased 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. That country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening sales in one of Apple's most crucial markets. China accounts for about 17% of its product sales.\nAs a result, Apple's stock fell nearly 4% in after-hours trading following its earnings release on Feb. 1.\nHowever, recent challenges are why keeping a long-term perspective with proven growth stocks like Apple is crucial. The company has a highly lucrative digital services business and is investing heavily in expanding markets like artificial intelligence (AI).\nAdditionally, the tech firm hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow last year. It has the funds to overcome current headwinds and continue investing in its business.\nWall Street seemed to have the opposite reaction to Amazon's earnings release. The e-commerce giant's shares rose by nearly 10% after it posted its Q4 2023 results on Feb. 1.\nDuring the quarter, Amazon's revenue grew 14% year over year to $170 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast by close to $4 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings per share came to $1, compared to an expected $0.80.\nMuch of Amazon's stellar growth came from its e-commerce business. Its North American segment posted operating income exceeding $6 billion, significantly improving on the $240 million in losses reported in the year-ago quarter.\nAmazon's Q4 was a fitting end to a stellar year of growth. After suffering steep declines in 2022 as spikes in inflation curbed consumer discretionary spending, the company pulled off an impressive turnaround.\nAs a result, Amazon's stock is up 63% year over year, compared to a 28% rise in Apple's share price. During the same period, Amazon's free cash flow soared by 427% to $17 billion. Apple's total free cash flow is higher, but declined by just over 1% over the last 12 months.\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory, with solid retail growth and a highly profitable cloud business.\nComparing these firms' forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/E), Apple's 28 against Amazon's 48 makes the iPhone company's stock look like a far better value. Forward P/E is a valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's share price by its estimated future earnings per share. The lower the figure, generally, the better the value.\nHowever, the chart below shows their valuations are more complex than that.\nThis chart shows Apple's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share over the next two fiscal years, and Amazon's might reach just under $7 per share. Multiplying these figures by the companies' forward P/E ratios yields stock prices of $218 for Apple and $317 for Amazon.\nBased on their current positions, these projections would see Apple's stock price rise 17% by fiscal 2026, while Amazon shares would increase by 84%.\nAs a result, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer in a decision between these two companies. The tech giant is on a growth path too good to ignore, making it the better stock to buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia reports quarterly results on Feb. 21.\nMorgan Stanley raised its price target to $750 from $603, with analyst Joseph Moore writing in a client note that \"AI demand continues to surge\".\nAfter Nvidia's stock more than tripled in 2023, it has already become the U.S. stock market's fifth most valuable company.\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services, with Meta Platforms and other Big Tech companies buying billions of dollars worth of Nvidia's graphics processors.\nAI developers face months-long waiting lists to use Nvidia's processors through cloud-computing providers, although those wait times are coming down, Morgan Stanley's Moore wrote.\nThe last time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under $6 billion.\nAn early leader in the AI race, Microsoft in January overtook Apple to become the world's most valuable company. Behind that duo, among the world's most valuable publicly-listed companies, are state oil giant Saudi Aramco, Alphabet and Amazon.\nSaudi Aramco has a $2-trillion market capitalization, making it the world's third most valuable publicly listed company, according to LSEG data. However, over 90% of that company is closely held by the government of Saudi Arabia and less than 2% of its shares are available for trading by investors.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich, Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Text": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.\nWhile each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.\nWhether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.\nApple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.\nBoth Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.\nBut most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.\nI find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.\nSince SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.\nConsidering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

Last week, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) reported its fourth quarter earnings and it topped estimates fueled by AI demand that continues to be unrelenting in the U.S.\nFor the quarter ended on December 31st, Palantir reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $608.4 million, topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$602.4 million. Net income grew from $30.9 million, or 1 cent per share Palantir earned in 2022\u2019s comparable quarter to $93.4 million, or 4 cents per share. Adjusted earnings of 8 cents were in line with LSEG\u2019s estimate.\nPalantir reported its customer base grew 35% YoY to\u00a0497 customers it served during the fourth quarter, showing it is enjoying a surging demand in the private sector whose customer count rose 44% annually. Therefore, Palantir showed it is successfully building its business outside its legacy government sector. What\u2019s even more impressive is that Palantir used a low-cost mechanism to get customers into its pipeline.\nWhile Microsoft infused billions into OpenAI, with Amazon and Alphabet following suit by investing into Antrophic, Palantir tried to stand out with a unique lead generation strategy.\u00a0By hosting almost 600 immersive seminars that it calls \"boot camps\u201d, Palantir aimed to fuel interest in its AI platform as it gives attendees the opportunity to try out its software and understand the value of Palantir\u2019s contribution in generative AI-drive use cases. In 2023 alone, Palantir successfully hosted over 500 of those boot camps with growth of its private sector software users showing they did a good job of luring them in.\nPalantir has delivered when it comes to profitability and it passed the test of consistency.\u00a0Although its market cap of only $51 billion\u00a0doesn\u2019t place it in the\u00a0basket tech mammoths like Microsoft,\u00a0its latest jaw-dropping report had no shortage of impressive key performance indicators that sent its stock to the Moon as it rocketed by roughly 50% over the\u00a0five trading days that followed its latest report.\u00a0Like Microsoft and Amazon, Palantir showed what AI can do for business with expanding margins flowing to the bottom line, along with compounding cash flow.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Text": "By Noel Randewich\n(Reuters) - Nvidia was on the verge of overtaking Alphabet as Wall Street's third most valuable company on Tuesday as the dominant AI chipmaker ended the day with a market capitalization above Amazon's for the first time in two decades.\nNvidia's shares slipped 0.17%, leaving its stock market value at $1.78 trillion, eclipsing Amazon's $1.75 trillion value after the online shopping and cloud-computing heavyweight's stock declined 2.15%.\nGoogle-owner Alphabet's stock dipped 1.62%, leaving its market capitalization at $1.81 trillion.\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services, with its graphics processors in short supply as Meta Platforms and other Big Tech companies buy billions of dollars worth of its components.\nMizuho in a client note raised its price target for Nvidia's stock to $825 from $625 ahead of the Santa Clara, California, company's quarterly results due on Feb. 21. The stock ended Tuesday at $721.28.\nLead times for Nvidia's top-shelf H100 processor have declined, \"but overall demand far outstrips supply,\" Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote, adding he sees \"substantial AI upside\" for Nvidia, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices.\nNvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock up 46% this year after more than tripling in 2023. Technology-related companies, including Microsoft and Meta, have also rallied to record highs on AI optimism.\nAlphabet has put chatbot technology into its Google search engine while marketing generative AI tools to cloud customers. Its stock hit an all-time high a day before its quarterly report on Jan. 30 failed to meet investors' high expectations and sent its shares tumbling. Alphabet's stock remains up 4% in 2024.\nNvidia's market capitalization briefly overtook Amazon's on Monday, but Amazon was back on top by the end of that trading session.\nThe previous time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under $6 billion. By mid-2004, Nvidia's stock market value had tumbled to under $2 billion as Alphabet listed its shares at a valuation of $23 billion.\nAn early leader in the AI race, Microsoft in January overtook Apple to become the world's most valuable company, now valued at over $3 trillion. State oil giant Saudi Aramco is the world's third most valuable publicly listed company, according to LSEG.\nWidely viewed as lagging in the AI race, Apple's stock has dropped 4% in 2024.\nSaudi Aramco has a $2 trillion market capitalization, although over 90% of it is closely held by the government of Saudi Arabia and less than 2% of its shares are available for trading by investors.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Author": " Allan Sloan    \u00b7 Contributing columnist",
        "Text": "If you\u2019ve ever wanted an example of how creaky and cumbersome the ancient Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) has become compared with modern market metrics, take a look at this week\u2019s Dow triple play involving Walmart (WMT), Walgreens (WBA), and Amazon (AMZN).\nOn Monday, the Dow replaced Walgreens with Amazon in reaction to Walmart splitting its stock 3-for-1.\nThat split, for reasons we\u2019ll get to in a bit, reduced Walmart\u2019s weight in the average \u2014 yes, the Dow is an average, not an index \u2014 by two-thirds.\nAdding Amazon to the Dow, the folks at S&P Dow Jones Indices say, was done to keep retail companies\u2019 weight in the average from falling sharply because of Walmart\u2019s stock split.\nBecause the Dow has only 30 stocks, adding Amazon meant one of the other components had to go. So Walgreens Boots Alliance, which had the lowest weight in the Dow, got the boot and lost its alliance.\nWalgreens being booted from the Dow isn\u2019t exactly a surprise because its share price has fallen around 60% since being added to the average in June 2018, while the Dow has risen about 60%.\nHad Walgreens kept pace with the other 29 components, the Dow would be about 400 points higher than it is. With the Dow near 40,000, it\u2019s easy to see what little impact even an at-pace Walgreens would have made.\nAmazon, by contrast, has been a hot stock, one of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" that accounted for the bulk of the stock market\u2019s gains last year.\nWalgreens\u2019 Dow tenure lasted less than six years \u2014 an extraordinarily short time for a market metric that doesn\u2019t change its component stocks very often.\nBut its exit, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt insisted to me, isn\u2019t because Walgreens has slumped and Amazon has soared.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a better fit,\u201d Silverblatt said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying it\u2019s a better investment.\u201d\nOr, as Silverblatt put it on Yahoo Finance Live, Amazon will help the Dow stay \u201crelevant.\u201d\nNow, a key question: will being added to the Dow be good for Amazon\u2019s stock price?\nMy answer, which may surprise you, is no. Based on conversations I\u2019ve had with market mavens over the years, I don\u2019t think that being added to the Dow will make the slightest difference for Amazon shareholders. Just as Walgreens being kicked out won\u2019t make any difference to Walgreens shareholders.\nHow can I say that when the Dow is such a popular market metric?\nIt\u2019s because although the Dow has great mindshare, it has almost no financial market share compared with the hugely influential S&P 500 Index (^GSPC).\nLet me explain.\nThe Dow is calculated based on the share prices of its 30 components. That\u2019s why today\u2019s three-for-one split, which reduced Walmart\u2019s share price by two-thirds, reduced its weight in the Dow by two-thirds.\nThe S&P, on the other hand, measures companies by their total stock market value, not their nominal share price. That\u2019s a much better way to reflect value than using share prices, which \u2014 as Walmart\u2019s split shows \u2014 can fall substantially overnight even though nothing about the company has changed.\nSo the Dow needs to go through contortions to offset the impact of Walmart\u2019s stock split while the S&P 500 does nothing. Walmart\u2019s market capitalization is still around $472 billion, and that\u2019s what counts.\nThe reason the Dow and the S&P are calculated so differently is age. The Dow was founded in 1896, when computers didn\u2019t exist, and communication was glacial. Share prices were a quick and simple way to measure. The S&P 500, founded 61 years later, is a product of and for modern markets.\nRead more: How to start investing in 2024: A step-by-step guide\nThis difference in calculation methodology is why a whopping $5.75 trillion of investor money is indexed to the S&P, according to Howard Silverblatt, but only $87 billion \u2014 a minuscule 1.5% as much \u2014 is indexed to the Dow.\nBeing added to the S&P has a big impact on a company\u2019s share price because so much index money flows into it. And being dropped from the S&P hurts because all that index money flows out.\nHowever, so little money (relatively speaking) is indexed to the Dow that being added to it or dropped out of it has no impact, hence why being added to the Dow won\u2019t make any difference to Amazon\u2019s share price.\nOne more impact of the Walgreens-Walmart-Amazon triple play: Through Friday, each dollar change in any Dow component moved the average by about 6.59 points. Monday\u2019s number is different.\nThat\u2019s because at Monday\u2019s opening, the total share price of the 30 Dow components is different from the number at Friday\u2019s close.\nSo the Dowfolk had to tweak something called the Dow Divisor, which as of Friday was a wonderfully precise 0.15172752595384 and is equally precise today. Divide one by the divisor, and you see how much each dollar change in any Dow component moves the Dow.\nThe history of how the Dow Divisor came to be and how to tweak it to create your very own Dow is a lot of fun for those of us who like numbers.\nBut that\u2019s a subject for another day.\nAllan Sloan is an award-winning financial journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

Users can select their day and time up to seven days in advance, and they will receive reservation notifications two days and then an hour before the reservation expires in order to keep their preferred time, the announcement noted.\nPayment is required only when shoppers are ready to check out, and customers can modify or cancel their orders anytime, \u201cno obligations,\u201d per the email. \nCustomers can add items at any point before an Amazon gig worker begins picking the groceries.

        "Text": "Despite a booming U.S. economy and significant advancements in the tech sector, including a robust performance by companies like Nvidia Corp. and a thriving artificial intelligence (AI) industry, tech companies have continued to lay off workers at an alarming rate in 2024.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index has shown an impressive uptick and the U.S. economy added 353,000 jobs in January, outpacing economists\u2019 forecasts. However, this overall economic strength masks a wave of layoffs in the tech sector, underscoring a disconnect between the broader economy and the challenges in the tech industry.\nDon't Miss:\nA groundbreaking energy company plugs into the $400 billion EV industry and is seeking investors.\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\nIn 2024, the tech sector has already seen layoffs outpace those of the previous year, with over 42,324 tech employees laid off, averaging more than 780 layoffs each day. This follows nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, indicating a continued trend of job cuts within the industry. Major companies like Google, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp, Discord, Salesforce Inc., eBay Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. have all announced significant layoffs in January, despite the broader economic growth and job additions in other sectors\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\nSeveral factors contribute to this paradoxical situation. First, the rapid rise of AI necessitates significant investment in new technologies, leading companies to reallocate resources and trim their workforce.\nTrending: This startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.\nThe stock market\u2019s response has also played a role; companies that have announced layoffs have often seen their stock prices increase, suggesting investor approval of efforts to streamline operations and focus on profitability. This trend is compounded by pressure from Wall Street, which, following a significant sell-off of tech stocks in 2022, has pushed companies to improve their bottom lines by cutting costs, including workforce reductions\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\nThe tech sector\u2019s layoffs reflect a strategic shift toward efficiency and profitability, with companies reevaluating their workforce in light of post-pandemic operational needs and the integration of AI into their business models. Despite the layoffs, the demand for AI-related roles is expected to grow, albeit at a smaller scale, as companies continue to prioritize investments in this area\u200b\u200b.\nThis ongoing wave of layoffs, despite a supposedly booming economy, has significantly impacted the tech workforce, leading to job insecurity and a reevaluation of career paths in the industry. The narrative of tech as a stable and lucrative career choice is being challenged, pushing many to consider alternative employment opportunities or even career changes\u200b\u200b.\nIn summary, the tech industry\u2019s current state underscores a complex interplay of economic growth, technological advancement and the reconfiguration of the workforce. While the broader U.S. economy shows signs of strength, the tech sector\u2019s continued layoffs highlight the unique challenges and transitions facing one of the most dynamic industries in the global market.\nRead Next:\nFortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Despite Booming Economy And Record Profits Google, Amazon, Microsoft And More Lay Off Over 42,000 So Far In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

It\u2019s a tough business that\u2019s getting tougher,\u201d added Earle.\nSeveral experts agree with this position. For instance, Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College, believes one should invest in companies that exceed high growth targets and raise their forecasts every quarter.\nHe added, however, that in comparing Amazon to Walgreens, you do not have to do that much work to realize that Amazon is \u201ca much better bet.\u201d\n\u201cThe drugstore chain\u2019s removal from the Dow is bad for the stock. That\u2019s because money from investors aiming to own the Dow index will flow out of Walgreens \u2014 which could benefit Amazon\u2019s stock,\u201d he said.\nCohan also argued that Amazon\u2019s stock has more than doubled since bottoming out at the end of 2022 and that its upward trajectory should continue as long as the company can beat and raise in future quarters.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Amazon beat expectations but fell short on its forecast in its most recent quarter. In short, Amazon is not a perfect investment but it\u2019s better than Walgreens,\u201d he added.\nSome experts argued that retail investors should look beyond the immediate implications of Amazon replacing Walgreens in the Dow and, instead,\u00a0focus on fundamental analysis and market trends.\nLiam Hunt, director at SophisticatedInvestor.com, noted that Amazon offers potential growth driven by technological innovation and market expansion. It also has a diverse business model, spanning from online retail to cloud services. The leading e-commerce and cloud computing giant provides a broad revenue base that appeals to investors looking for multi-faceted, long-term growth opportunities.\nOn the other hand, Hunt said, Walgreens, as a staple in the healthcare and retail pharmacy sector, presents a different investment profile.\n\u201cIt offers stability and potential resilience during economic downturns due to the non-discretionary nature of its products. Additionally, Walgreens\u2019 focus on healthcare innovation and expansion into primary care services could present new growth avenues,\u201d he said.\nAccording to him, Amazon might suit those with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term investment perspective, seeking growth and innovation.\nOn the other hand, Walgreens could appeal to investors prioritizing stability, dividend income and lower volatility.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the choice between Amazon and Walgreens depends on matching the stock\u2019s characteristics with the investor\u2019s financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy,\u201d he noted. \u201cThose with a greater appetite for risk and volatility would likely be better served by allocating a greater share of their portfolio to Amazon over Walgreens.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Dollar Tree Items Frugal People Always Buy\n5 Used Cars You Shouldn't Buy\nWhat Makes a Good Bank in 2024, According to a Banking Expert\nI'm a Personal Finance Writer: These Are the Worst Money Mistakes I Made in 2023\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Amazon Replaces Walgreens in the Dow: Which Stock Is a Better Investment for You?\n"

        "Author": "  Bethan Moorcraft ",
        "Text": "Jeff Bezos made a masterful money move when he left his long-time digs in Seattle for a pad in Miami\u2019s so-called \u201cBillionaire Bunker.\u201d\nThe Amazon (AMZN) founder \u2014 currently the second-richest person in the world \u2014 said he moved to Florida in 2023 to be closer to his parents and his rocket company Blue Origin.\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here\u2019s how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nInflation is still white-hot in 2024 \u2014 use these 3 'real assets\u2019 to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says\nAnything can happen in 2024. Try these 5 easy money hacks to help you make and save thousands of dollars in the new year (they will only take seconds)\nDitching the Emerald City turned out to be a very lucrative decision for the businessman. It has since been reported by CNBC that his move to Indian Creek will save Bezos many millions of dollars in taxes.\nHere\u2019s how Bezos is keeping his dollars from Uncle Sam \u2014 and three ways you can do the same (even if you\u2019re not sitting on billions like Bezos).\nSince the late 1990s, Bezos has sold billions of dollars worth of Amazon shares to fund his philanthropy, other business projects and his billionaire lifestyle.\nBut in 2022, he hit pause on his stock sales when Washington state imposed a new 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000.\nAfter moving to Florida, Bezos took his foot off the brake. He recently sold around 12 million Amazon shares for roughly $2 billion, according to a company filing on Feb. 9.\nAs a resident of the Sunshine State \u2014 which does not tax on capital gains \u2014 Bezos managed to save around $140 million in taxes he would have had to pay to Washington state for the same transaction.\nHe also announced a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before Jan. 31, 2025, which would be worth nearly $8.5 billion today.\nWith the Florida advantage, he will save around $593 million on capital gains taxes \u2014 and that\u2019s if Amazon shares remain flat (bear in mind that the stock has jumped more than 13% so far this year).\nIt\u2019s important to note that both states \u2014 Washington and Florida \u2014 have no state income tax and their real property tax rates both hover around 1%. The real game-changer, for Bezos at least, seems to be Washington\u2019s relatively new capital gains tax, which would see him hand billions over to the IRS. Here are three ways you can save some of your hard-earned cash from the tax man.\nIf your tax bill fills you with financial dread year after year, then maybe you should consider a Bezos-style move to a different, more tax-friendly state. That's what financial gurus like Grant Cardone have been recommending.\nThey often cite recent migration trends in their arguments. Texas and Florida experienced the highest population growth in 2023, according to Census Bureau data, with gains of 473,453 people and 365,205 people, respectively. Both states have no personal income tax \u2014 which could help you save a good chunk of your pay from Uncle Sam each year.\nIf you\u2019re considering moving states because you\u2019re tired of paying high income taxes, it\u2019s important to remember that personal income tax rates only tell part of the tax story.\nYou have to consider each individual state\u2019s personal income tax brackets and the available deductions, exemptions and credits. Also remember that property and sales taxes can impact a state\u2019s affordability.\nFor example, while Texas has no state income tax, it has one of the highest effective property tax rates in the country, at 1.68%. In a similar vein, zero-individual income tax Tennessee has the highest sales tax in the country, at 9.548%.\nRead more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now cash in on prime real estate \u2014 without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how\nIf you\u2019re considering making a move, it may be worth consulting with a tax professional to get a clear picture of your total tax liabilities before packing up your life.\nThere's also other factors to consider. The average cost of homeowners insurance in Florida is three times more than the national average and has increased 102% in the last three years, per the Insurance Information Institute.\nIf you\u2019d rather stay put where you live, one of the easiest ways to hold some money back from the IRS is to invest in tax-advantaged vehicles like a 401(k) account or an individual retirement account (IRA).\nWith a 401(k) retirement savings plan, you can steer a portion of your pay into an account \u2014 up to $23,000 in 2024 \u2014 which you can then invest to grow your money. You won\u2019t pay tax on those contributions until you withdraw your funds during retirement, and by then you should be in a lower income-tax bracket.\nIf you don\u2019t have access to a 401(k), you might consider opening a traditional IRA, where you can contribute pretax income \u2014 up to $7,000 (for those under age 50) and $8,000 (for those age 50 or older) in an IRA in 2024 \u2014 and grow it tax-free until you make withdrawals in retirement.\nAnother option is a Roth IRA, where your contributions are taxed upfront so that your withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This, of course, is less helpful for reducing your upcoming tax liability \u2014 but Roth IRAs can offer some advantages and flexibility compared to traditional IRAs.\nYou can reduce the amount of money you owe to the IRS through effective usage of tax credit and tax deductions. If you don't have an accountant, tax prep softwares can search through credits and deductions for you.\nTax credits are highly desirable because they directly reduce your tax bill. Some popular examples include: the child tax credit (CTC), the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit and the earned income tax credit (EITC).\nAll tax credits have different thresholds for eligibility and are often based partly on your income. It is important to monitor the IRS tax credit requirements if your income changes over time.\nTax deductions are slightly different in that they lower your taxable income. When filing your taxes, you\u2019re given the choice to either take the standard deduction or itemize deductions.\nFor tax-year 2024, the standard deduction for single filers is $14,600 and $29,200 for joint filers.\nItemizing your deductions allows you to claim qualified deductions individually \u2014 like medical expenses, donations and mortgage interest, etc. \u2014 but while that may save you a few extra bucks, it won\u2019t take any stress out of your taxes.\nRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\nRobert Kiyosaki warns 401(k)s and IRAs will be 'toast' after the 'biggest crash in history' \u2014 protect yourself now with these shockproof assets\nCredit card debt under inflation's shadow: The 4 potent weapons you need to have for a strong financial resurgence\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology Inc. MU.\nThe Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4% last year, recording its best year since 2020. The index\u2019s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle last month, although finally, it closed January on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\nHowever, the tech-laden index has regained momentum in February. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 8.3% compared with 6% gain of the S&P 500 and 2.5% of the Dow. Last week, the index advanced 2.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA \u2014 the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets \u2014 raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. \u2014 the world's largest contract chipmaker \u2014 recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (\u201cWSTS\u201d) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\nOn Feb 9, the Biden administration announced an investment of $5 billion in a public-private consortium to support R&D activities in advanced computer chips. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation allots $50 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.\nThe National Semiconductor Technology Center (\"NSTC\") was funded through this act with $39 billion allocated to chip manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip R&D purposes. The newly released $5 billion will also be given to NSTC as the government recognized NSTC as the centerpiece of the administration\u2019s R&D efforts.\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 39% share of global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12% at present.\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology behemoths with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance.\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\nMETA\u2019s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\nNVIDIA Corp. is gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA\u2019s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVDA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026.\nZacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 54.7% and 64.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.9% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 30 days.\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU\u2019s chips used in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU\u2019s memory and storage.\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42.8% and 90.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.3% over the last 30 days.\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nIt\u2019s a little-known chemical company that\u2019s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.\nThis company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.\nFree: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Text": "Plymouth Industrial REIT (NYSE:PLYM), boasting a dividend yield of 4%, stands out as a notable investment opportunity in the real estate sector, with a keen focus on industrial and distribution properties. This specialization is increasingly pertinent in light of the burgeoning e-commerce sector, which demands a greater need for sophisticated distribution hubs and expansive industrial spaces.\nThe acceleration of online retail, fueled by technological innovations and significant shifts in consumer preferences, not only underscores Plymouth Industrial REIT\u2019s strategic investment potential but also its symbiotic relationship with e-commerce juggernauts such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). By serving the logistical needs of these leading online marketplaces, Plymouth Industrial REIT is uniquely positioned to offer investors a blend of steady income and growth-oriented returns, tapping into the dynamic expansion of global e-commerce activities.\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\u00a0\nAn interesting facet of investing in Plymouth Industrial REIT is its exposure to a broad range of tenants, including several e-commerce and logistics companies. This diversity in tenancy provides investors with a multifaceted approach to capitalizing on the e-commerce boom, indirectly benefiting from the sector\u2019s rapid growth. Unlike traditional investment options that often force a choice between growth and income, Plymouth Industrial REIT offers a blend of both. By anchoring its investments in the industrial spaces essential for e-commerce and logistics operations, the company is well-placed in a burgeoning market segment while also ensuring a steady income stream through dividends as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).\nPlymouth Industrial REIT owns and operates a significant portfolio of industrial properties in key markets across the United States, focusing on both major urban centers and strategic secondary markets. This broad geographical presence is crucial for mitigating regional economic fluctuations and capitalizing on diverse market dynamics. The company\u2019s properties, which are pivotal for the operations of numerous supply chain and logistics entities, guarantee a robust and varied tenant base. The growing dependence on effective distribution and logistics networks highlights the sustained demand for Plymouth\u2019s industrial and warehouse spaces.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Plymouth Industrial REIT declared a dividend of $0.23 per share, leading to total dividends of $0.92 for the January to December 2023 period. Investing in Plymouth Industrial REIT goes beyond a simple stake in industrial real estate; it offers an avenue to indirectly partake in the e-commerce sector\u2019s growth. As online shopping continues to evolve, driven by consumer preferences and technological innovation, Plymouth\u2019s role in supporting this ecosystem becomes increasingly crucial, potentially bolstering its dividend outlook. This connection provides a compelling incentive for investors to consider Plymouth Industrial REIT as a means to diversify their investment portfolio and tap into the thriving e-commerce industry.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

        "Title": "Will Nvidia Beat Amazon and Google in Joining Apple and Microsoft in the $2 Trillion Club?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) delivered a sizzling return of nearly 240% last year. Believe it or not, the stock is on pace to generate gains that aren't too far behind that mark in 2024.\nThanks to its share price soaring close to 50% so far this year, Nvidia now sports a market cap of nearly $1.83 trillion. Will the chipmaker beat Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) in joining Apple and Microsoft in the $2 trillion club?\nMicrosoft currently stands at the top of the mountain with a market cap of over $3 trillion. Apple isn't too far behind, with its market cap of more than $2.8 trillion. For now, these are the only stocks with market caps above $2 trillion.\nNvidia only needs to rise another 10% or so to join Apple and Microsoft in the $2 trillion club. However, Alphabet and Amazon are nipping at Nvidia's heels with market caps of $1.82 trillion and $1.77 trillion, respectively.\nIt's a neck-and-neck race at this point. The momentum is certainly on Nvidia's side, though. Its stock performance trounced both Alphabet and Amazon in 2023 and has continued to do so thus far this year.\nThe primary potential catalyst that could push Nvidia's market cap above the $2 trillion threshold is the strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Surging interest in generative AI is providing an ongoing tailwind for GPU demand.\nBut Alphabet and Amazon also benefit from the generative AI boom. The two companies provide cloud services with a variety of tools to help customers build generative AI apps.\nWall Street appears to be most confident about Amazon's prospects of joining the $2 trillion club soon. The average 12-month price target for Amazon reflects an upside potential of 21%. Of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February, 43 rated the stock as a buy or strong buy.\nAnalysts are also upbeat about Alphabet. The consensus price target for the stock is 12% above the current share price. Thirty-eight of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG this month rate Alphabet as a buy or strong buy.\nWhat about Nvidia? There's still some enthusiasm about the chip stock on Wall Street. However, the overall mood isn't nearly as positive compared to the sentiment for Amazon and Alphabet.\nThe average 12-month price target for Nvidia is 7% below the current share price. While 21 of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February rate Nvidia as a buy or strong buy, another 15 recommend holding the stock. One analyst rates the stock as an underperform. One analyst recommends that investors sell their Nvidia shares.\nThis is a big swing from January, when all but five analysts rated Nvidia as a buy or a strong buy. It's probably fair to say that many on Wall Street now think that Nvidia's share price has gotten ahead of itself, even with the company's tremendous growth prospects.\nI'm confident that the market caps of Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia will top $2 trillion over time. Which stock will join the $2 trillion club first? My hunch is that it will indeed be Nvidia.\nYes, the limited availability of GPUs due to strong demand is motivating customers to look to other AI chipmakers, such as AMD\u00a0and to develop their own chips. Nvidia's meteoric trajectory since early last year won't be sustainable indefinitely. However, it doesn't have to be for the stock to beat Amazon and Alphabet over the near term.\nAll three stocks need close to the same percentage gain to hit $2 trillion. Nvidia has the strongest tailwind of the three right now. Perhaps just as important, though, is that the company is likely to report its next quarterly results a day or two before Amazon and Alphabet do. Positive news could push Nvidia over the threshold.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican antitrust regulator Cofece said on Tuesday it had identified \"possible barriers\" to competition in the e-commerce market, with Amazon and Mercado Libre together controlling more than 85% of transactions and sales.\nIn a preliminary report shared in the official gazette, Cofece said strong networks between users' groups limit new entrants to the market and pose a \"practically insurmountable challenge for the expansion of the smaller players.\"\nSmaller retailers face high investments for the technological tools, operating inventories and advertising needed to compete with these giants, it said, adding that this is exacerbated by the clustering of both buyers and sellers around one marketplace, or \"singlehoming.\"\nSmaller participants meanwhile \"exert insufficient competitive pressure on Amazon and Mercado Libre,\" the Mexican regulator stated, because they lack the number of buyers and sellers needed to compete.\nCofece recommended that the government orders the two retail giants to implement a program of \"corrective measures\" within six months. Those include greater transparency for service providers and splitting off streaming services from marketplace membership.\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a statement issued late on Tuesday, Mercado Libre said it was analyzing Cofece's preliminary report, which it described as the start of the process, and pledged its cooperation.\nIt stressed that even if Cofece's governing board eventually issues a formal resolution, it would not involve any economic sanctions since no investigation into monopolistic practices has been launched.\nU.S. behemoth Amazon entered Mexico in 2013 and launched its marketplace there two years later. Mercado Libre, its South American counterpart, entered Latin America's second-largest economy in 1999 and has been expanding its financial service offerings.\n($1 = 17.1977 Mexican pesos)\n(Reporting by Raul Cortes; Editing by Sharon Singleton, Emelia Sithole-Matarise an Jacqueline Wong)\n"

This week\u2019s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA.\nWe have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market.\nThese companies, along with their peers in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of stocks \u2013 Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia \u2013 led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year.\nOther than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn\u2019t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively.\nTesla\u2019s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market.\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.\nThis week\u2019s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week\u2019s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, February 2nd, we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members, or 46% of the index\u2019s total membership.\nWe have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. This week\u2019s line-up includes a who\u2019s who of the index, including Disney, Elli Lilly, MacDonalds, DuPont, Caterpillar, Ford, Pepsi, Chipotle, Uber, PayPal, Expedia, and many others.\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 230 index members that have reported already are up +4.2% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Flexes Strong Growth \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The company\u2019s second-quarter results gained from strong Intelligent Cloud, and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million.Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers, holds promise.However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+75.9% vs. +47.6%). Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was also a positive.A robust advertising business contributed well. Notably, improving Alexa skills, along with an array of smart home products offerings remain tailwinds. Amazon\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses are positives, as well.Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are additional successes for Amazon.

        "Title": "Mesh, a B2B Identity Startup Founded by Ex-Amazon Execs, Unveils Multi-Factor Business Identity Solution for Marketplaces, Ecommerce, Compliance; Bolsters Leadership with Industry Veterans",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "AUSTIN, Texas & SEATTLE, February 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mesh, the modern provider of real-time professional license verification trusted by leading marketplaces, today announced the launch of its Multi-Factor Business Identity solution for marketplaces, ecommerce, and vendor & contractor compliance. Co-founded by ex-Amazon executives, Diego Asenjo (CEO) and Tony Bryan (CTO), and following a $5.7 million seed round led by Greycroft, Mesh now helps companies seamlessly verify, onboard, and monitor any legitimate U.S. business \u2013 along with their registration, licensing, insurance, and background information \u2013 with industry-leading 99%+ satisfaction reported by verified SMBs and sole-proprietors.\nAn overwhelming majority of companies with business onboarding, trust and safety, and vendor compliance needs depend on manual reviews. Advisory firm Liminal found that 98% of surveyed companies require some manual review, with nearly 60% relying on manual reviews for at least a quarter of their business verifications. Their findings among financial institutions echo Mesh\u2019s insights on buyer and seller onboarding in ecommerce, marketplace trust, and vendor compliance.\nTo solve this problem, mid-size and large companies often deploy teams across product, engineering, data science, and operations, and a stack of vendors to get the necessary business signals and increase coverage. Still, these companies require tens to hundreds of manual operators to review small and micro businesses that are partially or fully \"invisible\" to their vendors and annually see millions of dollars lost to customer friction, regulatory non-compliance, and fraud.\nWith Mesh, there is a better way. Mesh\u2019s Business and Entity Verification (BEV) solution combines privacy-centric data collection, hundreds of proprietary integrations with primary sources and real-time government data, an ecosystem of data partners, and identity lifecycle workflows to offer unmatched accuracy, data freshness, and non-compliance detection \u2013 while delivering high automation, conversion, and SMB satisfaction.\n\"Mesh has effectively addressed the challenges of establishing business trust and navigating compliance with their innovative Business and Entity Verification solution. We are thrilled with Mesh\u2019s expertise and vision in bringing an accurate and seamless solution for companies,\" said Elaine Russell, Operating Partner at Greycroft.\n\"Mesh's extensive integrations into disparate data sources give them the ability to automate the vast majority of business identity verification, relieving customers of painstaking manual review processes and bringing a frictionless user experience that consumers have grown accustomed to in the B2B world,\" said Ruth Foxe Blader, General Partner at Foxe Capital.\nIntroducing Multi-Factor Business Identity Verification\nMesh introduced the next evolution in its verification platform, offering:\nMultiple Signals: Mesh delivers signals including, but not limited to, business user identity, licenses, insurance, tax information, business risk, end-user risk, and documentary evidence through a single API.\nDynamic Data Capture: Mesh dynamically adapts its data capture experience to customers\u2019 order parameters, end-user inputs, and real-time risk signals, ensuring a radically simple and tailored user-friendly experience.\nReal-Time Data: Mesh triangulates real-time verifications with hundreds of governments, third-party data, and partner networks, and delivers unmatched data freshness with risk labels for customers to automate decisions.\nEnterprise Platform: Mesh makes its data collection frictionless and transparent, tailored to customers' needs with multiple fast-start options. Mesh is already trusted by multi-billion dollar marketplaces.\nPrivacy by Design: Mesh secures data collected from SMBs with bank-level encryption and only shares it with their consent. Mesh is proudly SOC2 Type II Certified.\nMesh\u2019s journey from License Verification to a Business and Entity Verification (BEV) solution signifies an evolution into a complete, end-to-end business identity platform.\nDiego Asenjo, CEO of Mesh, said, \"The status quo is frustrating. Business verification processes can take a day or more in 30%+ of cases, and often, small businesses are simply invisible to single-point solution providers. Companies must also integrate and triangulate with multiple disparate single-point solution providers for business, license, insurance, and other data \u2013 which is time-consuming to implement, customize, and maintain across platforms. And despite their efforts, companies suffer losses stemming from incomplete coverage and stale data. Companies love Mesh\u2019s comprehensive identity platform because of our uncompromising commitment to delightful data capture experiences, accuracy, and in-depth coverage with real-time data with a single multi-factor API that is a no-brainer. Legitimate small businesses and sole proprietors love that getting verified with Mesh\u2019s custom-branded building blocks feels safe, quick, and easy.\"\n\"The response to verifications by Mesh from our community has been very positive, and we\u2019re pleased with the increased engagement we\u2019ve seen from verification. Homeowners see the verification badge, which increases their trust and the likelihood of a connection. Our Verified Pros see higher quality leads and get more business. We\u2019ve created a healthier ecosystem for our customers. Everyone wins here,\" said John Mannelly, Senior Product Manager from Houzz.\nExpanded Leadership\nWith 30+ years of senior Amazon experience, Diego Asenjo (CEO), Tony Bryan (CTO), and founding engineers rounded out their leadership team with industry veterans. They are Mike Nelson (CRO), who founded the identity verification (IDV) business at Mitek and led revenue at BehavioSec (acquired by LexisNexis Risk Solutions) as the company\u2019s CRO; and Andres Benvenuto (VP of Partnerships & Data), with 20+ years of experience in data businesses like Socure, Dun & Bradstreet, and Creditsafe.\nFor more information on how to auto-verify more SMBs, visit meshverify.com.\nAbout Mesh\nMesh\u2019s mission is to make business identity radically simple, trusted, and portable for 100% of legitimate businesses, enabling seamless, trusted, and compliant interactions \u2013 starting with Marketplaces, Ecommerce, Home Services & Construction, and Property Management.\nFor press inquiries, please reach out to media@meshverify.com\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240207022887/en/\nContacts\nmedia@meshverify.com\n"

        "Title": "5 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After examining many stocks in today's market, I've concluded that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the best buys available. Even though it's had a strong 2024, up 11%, I still think there is room for upside. I've pinpointed five factors that make Amazon a strong buy now, even with its great performance in 2024.\nWhile Amazon is well-known for its commerce business, it has quietly transitioned to a service business. These divisions include third-party seller services, advertising services, subscription services, and its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Combined, these segments brought in $92.9 billion in revenue versus the commerce side's revenue of $75.7 billion.\nThis is critical, as these services are vital for many businesses, which makes them more sustainable. Additionally, even though Amazon doesn't break out the profitability of each division, looking at similar companies like Shopify for third-party sellers or Alphabet for advertising, it's evident that services have much better margins.\nThis leads me to my next reason for buying. Thanks to the rise of service divisions, Amazon's gross margins have skyrocketed over the past decade.\nA higher gross margin gives Amazon the potential to have a better profit margin, which has also improved in recent quarters after tanking thanks to overspending to fulfill pandemic-era demand. This will be a key metric for investors to watch as Amazon attempts to transition to becoming a company maximized for profits.\nA key profit contributor is AWS, the cloud computing business. In the fourth quarter, Amazon's North American commerce business made $6.5 billion in operating profits, while the international business lost $419 million. However, AWS picked up the slack, producing $7.2 billion in operating profits despite having much lower sales figures (AWS had $24.2 billion in sales in Q4 versus North American commerce sales of $106 billion).\nAWS saw its profitability dip slightly as 2022's Q4 operating margin was 24%. But it promptly recovered in 2023, and Q4 saw an operating profit of 30%\nOne item that has come into the spotlight is AWS's growth. In Q4, it was up 13%, while competitors Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure both saw revenue growth in the high 20% range. While there are multiple reasons for this, Amazon's management is starting to see new workloads come online, which should boost AWS's growth throughout 2024. This is key as AWS is vital to Amazon's profitability.\nWhile Amazon has had a strong year, its stock remains reasonably priced. Using traditional valuation metrics like a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't ideal with Amazon, as it isn't fully optimized for profits. Instead, I'll use the price-to-sales ratio to evaluate the business. At three times sales, Amazon is valued at about the same level it was in 2018 and still below where it was during the pandemic sell-off.\nLast is maybe the most important factor of all: Improving cash flows.

        "Author": "  Noel Randewich ",
        "Text": "By Noel Randewich\n(Reuters) - Wall Street's enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has Nvidia on the verge of becoming more valuable than Amazon for the first time in two decades, and the AI chipmaker is not far behind Google-owner Alphabet.\nA 40% surge in Nvidia so far in 2024 has elevated its market capitalization to $1.715 trillion as of mid-day trading on Wednesday, only about 3% below Amazon's $1.767 trillion value, and less than 6% below Alphabet's $1.812 trillion value, according to LSEG data.\nNvidia's shares gained 1.8% to $694.48 after an optimistic report from Morgan Stanley. Nvidia reports quarterly results on Feb. 21.\nMorgan Stanley raised its price target to $750 from $603, with analyst Joseph Moore writing in a client note that \"AI demand continues to surge\".\nAfter Nvidia's stock more than tripled in 2023, it has already become the U.S. stock market's fifth most valuable company.\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services, with Meta Platforms and other Big Tech companies buying billions of dollars worth of Nvidia's graphics processors.\nAI developers face months-long waiting lists to use Nvidia's processors through cloud-computing providers, although those wait times are coming down, Morgan Stanley's Moore wrote.\nThe last time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under $6 billion.\nAn early leader in the AI race, Microsoft in January overtook Apple to become the world's most valuable company. Behind that duo, among the world's most valuable publicly-listed companies, are state oil giant Saudi Aramco, Alphabet and Amazon.\nSaudi Aramco has a $2-trillion market capitalization, making it the world's third most valuable publicly listed company, according to LSEG data. However, over 90% of that company is closely held by the government of Saudi Arabia and less than 2% of its shares are available for trading by investors.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich, Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Text": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 1, 2024\nOperator: Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's use as of today, February 1, 2024, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially, additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't include any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements, it's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today we\u2019re reporting $170 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, $13.2 billion in operating income, up 383% year-over-year, or $10.5 billion and $35.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $48.3 billion year-over-year. While we've made meaningful progress in our financial measures, what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, adjusting and reimagining from teams across Amazon. Looking back at Q4, I'll start with our stores business where customers responded to our continued focus on selection price and convenience.\nWe continue to have the broadest retail selection with hundreds and millions of products available and added tens of millions of new items last year alone, including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's Secrets Fashion, Pit Viper, and Beyonce\u2019s Renaissance to our Merge to cosmetics from Lancome, Urban Decay, cosmetics and No Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, to consumer technology and services from Boost, Infinite, and Woop to homewares for Martha Stewart. Being sharp on price is always important. But particularly in an uncertain economy where customers are careful about how much they're spending. We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever.\nThese events also helped attract new customers and Prime members. Throughout the quarter customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day including more than 4 billion in the U.S and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S this result is the combination of two things, one is the benefit of regionalization, where we\u2019ve architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the U.S in the fourth quarter, we increase the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year.\nAs we're able to get customers items this fast. It increases the number of occasions that customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs. And we can see that in all sorts of areas including how fast or everyday essentials business is growing. Our regionalization efforts have also brought transportation distances down which has helped lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we've reduced our cost-to-serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S alone, cost-to-serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit compared to the prior year. Lowering cost-to-serve allows us not only to invest in speed improvements, but also afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices or ASPs and profitably. We have a saying, that it's not hard to lower prices, it's hard to be able to afford lowering prices.\nThe same is true with adding selection, it's not hard to add lower ASPs selection, it's hard to be able to afford offering lower ASPs selection and still like the economics. Like improving speed, adding selection puts us in the consideration set for more purchases. As we look toward 2024 and beyond, we're not done lowering our cost to serve. We've challenged every closely held belief for our fulfillment network and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there's more upside for us. Alongside our stores business, our advertising growth remains strong, up 26% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by our sponsored ads.\nWe've recently added Sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S. a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business. While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach engage viewers on Twitch, Freevee, Fire TV and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the U.S., as well as Thursday Night Football. Shifting to AWS. Revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year in Q4 versus 12% year-over-year in Q3. And we're now approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion. We watched the incremental revenue added each quarter and in Q4 AWS added more than $1.1 billion an incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which on an FX neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell.\nWhile cost optimization continued to attenuate larger new deals also accelerated, evidenced by recently inked agreements with Salesforce, BMW, NVIDIA, LG, Hyundai, Merck, MUFG, Axiata, Cafe, BYD, Arcore, Amgen, and SAIC. Our customer pipeline remains strong, as existing customers are renewing larger commitments over longer periods and migrations are growing. 2023 also was a very significant year of delivery and customer trial for generative AI or Gen AI in AWS. You may remember that we've explained our vision of three distinct layers in the Gen AI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which were deeply investing. At the bottom layer, where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute with a chip is the key component in that compute, we offer the most expansive collection of compute instances with NVIDIA chips.\nWe also have customers who would like us to push the price performance envelope on AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips, which are 40% more price performance than other X86 alternatives. And as a result, we built custom AI training chips, named Trainium, and inference chips, name Inferentia, and reinvent we now as Trainium2, which offers four times faster training performance and three times more memory capacity versus the first generation of Trainium, enabling advantageous price performance versus alternatives. We already have several customers using our AI chips including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh and Snap. In the middle layer where companies seek to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and leverage AWS\u2019 security other features all as a managed service, we've launched Bedrock which is off to a very strong start with many 1,000s of customers using the service after just a few months.\nThe team continues to rapidly iterate on Bedrock, recently delivering capabilities including guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, knowledge bases to expand models knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation or RAG and real time queries, agents to complete multi step tasks and fine tuning to keep teaching and refining models. All which will help customers applications be higher quality and have better customer experiences. We also added new models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta with Llama2, Stability AI and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs [ph]. What customers have learned at this early stage of Gen AI, is it there's meaningful iteration required in building a production Gen AI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed.\nCustomers don't want only one model, they want different models for different types of applications, and different size models for different applications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple and this is what Bedrock does, which is why so many customers are excited about it. And to top layer of the stack is the application layer, one of the very best early gen AI applications is a coded companion. At Reinvent, we launched Amazon Q, which is an expert on AWS, writes code, debugs code, tests code, does translations like moving from an old version of Java to a new one and can also query customer\u2019s various data repositories, like Internet, Wickes or from over 40 different popular connectors to data in Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Elastin or Zendesk, among others.\nAnd answer questions, summarize this data, carry on a coherent conversation and take action. It was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start, making it easier for organizations to use generative AI safely. Q is the most capable work assistant and another service that customers are very excited about. By the way, don't underestimate the point about Bedrock and Q inheriting the same security and access control as customers get with AWS. Security is a big deal, an important differentiator between cloud providers. The data in these models is some of the company's most sensitive and critical assets. With AWS' advantaged security capabilities and track record relative to other providers, we continue to see momentum around customers wanting to do their long-term Gen AI work with AWS.\nWe're building dozens of Gen AI apps across Amazon's businesses, several of which have launched and others of which are in development. This morning, we launched Rufus, an expert shopping assistant trained on our product and customer data that represents a significant customer experience improvement for Discovery. Rufus lets customers ask shopping journey questions like what is the best golf ball to use for better spin control or which are the best cold weather rain jackets and get thoughtful explanations for what matters and recommendations on products. You can carry on a conversation with Rufus on other related or unrelated questions and retains context coherently. You can sift through our rich product pages by asking Rufus questions on any product features and will return answers quickly.\nWe're at the start of what Rufus will do with further personalization and expansion coming, but we're excited about how it will make discovery even easier on Amazon. Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon, primarily because there are a few initiatives, if any, that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes, and we believe it will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years. In addition to our stores and AWS businesses, we continue to make progress on newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term. Touching on two of them. In October, we had a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper, which is our low earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400 million to 500 million households who don't have it today.\nWe launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems, made a 2-way video call, streamed a Prime Video movie in Ultra HD 4K and made an Amazon purchase over our end-to-end communication network. It's rare to be able to exercise all these elements in an initial launch like this. We're on track to launch our first production satellite in the first half of 2024 and started beta testing in the second half of the year. We've still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress. During the quarter, we also completed our second season of Thursday Night Football, which was a rousing success by all accounts. The customer experience continued to improve as our talent, production, streaming quality, analytics, unique AI features like Prime Vision and defensive alerts, all took big leaps forward on top of the very good start last year.\nWe launched a new NFL tradition with the inaugural Black Friday football game and our continuous innovation resonated with viewers as the number of people watching increased 24% year-over-year and with advertisers as we made dramatic year-over-year gains in ad sales. We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own, and we'll continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members like Thursday Night Football, Go To The Rings, Reacher, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Citadel and more. And with the ads in Prime Video, we'll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time. I'll close by reiterating that 2023 was a really good year. I'm grateful to all of our teams who delivered on behalf of customers.\nYet I think every one of us at Amazon believes this is just the start of what's possible. We have a long way to go in every one of our businesses before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw strong performance in the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue was $170 billion, representing an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $3 billion above the top end of our guidance range. Saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $13.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 billion year-over-year and $2.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. For the full year 2023, we had a meaningful improvement across our financial results. Revenue was $574.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Operating income tripled year-over-year to $36.9 billion.\nTrailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $35.5 billion, up $48.3 billion versus last year. These financial outputs are a result of a lot of improvements in our key input metrics such as stores' cost to serve, which decreased year-over-year for the first time since 2018 and our ability to deliver to customers at our fastest speeds ever. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our teammates around the world for a very strong 2023 performance. Focusing on the fourth quarter, North America revenue was $105.5 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year and an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. International revenue was $40.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, also an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3.\nDuring the quarter, we remained focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers, price, selection and convenience. Our shopping events throughout the quarter included Prime Big Deal Days in October and our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping event helped to attract new Prime members and deliver billions in savings for customers. We made meaningful progress on delivery speeds in the United States and globally, which helped strong sales throughout the quarter, including notable strength in the last-minute gifting where our ability to provide fast shipping helped our Prime members ensure that they got their gifts before the holidays. These improvements in delivery speed have led to increased purchase frequency by our Prime members across all of our major geographies.\nIt also strengthened demand for our everyday essentials. Categories like beauty and health and personal care, where speed is even more important to customers. Third-party sellers were a big part of our success over the holidays with worldwide third-party seller services revenue growing at 19% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 61%, its highest level ever. We also saw strong performance in worldwide advertising, which grew 26% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products as our teams worked hard to increase the relevancy of the ads we show customers by leveraging machine learning. Advertising only works if the ads are helpful to customers and there's a lot of value in tailoring sponsored products, so they are relevant to what a customer is actually searching for.\nWe're also continually focused on improving our measurement capabilities, which allow brands to see the payback of their advertising spend. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $6.5 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 6.1%, up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins were at their recent low levels in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen seven consecutive quarters of improvement resulting in a cumulative improvement of 800 basis points over these past seven quarters. In addition to the strong top line growth, which helped to drive improved leverage throughout our businesses, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost to serve.\nThe fourth quarter is our busiest time of year, supported by an increasingly large and integrated operations network. Overall, our teams executed extremely well, yielding strong efficiency gains with minimal disruptions. We were pleased with the performance of our regionalized network during the holiday period, where we saw benefits from improved inventory placement helping drive faster speeds and also lowering costs. We also continue to see benefits from lower transportation rates, which include linehaul, ocean and rail and from a more stable labor market, resulting in improved staffing levels. In our International segment, we had an operating loss of $419 million, an improvement of $1.8 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through increased units per box, lower transportation rates and leverage across our fixed costs as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations.\nThe International segment represents more than 20 countries of varying degrees of growth and our largest established countries like the U.K., Germany and Japan, relatively strong revenue growth contributed to the year-over-year improvement in profitability. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they continued to expand their customer offerings, while seeking to invest wisely. Moving to AWS. Revenues were $24.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $1.1 billion of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, we continue to see the diminishing impact of cost optimizations.\nAnd as these optimization slow down, we're seeing more companies turning their attention to newer initiatives and reaccelerating existing migrations. Customers are also excited about our approach to generative AI. Still relatively early days, but the revenues are accelerating rapidly across all 3 layers and our approach to democratizing AI is resonating well with our customers. We have seen significant interest from our customers wanting to run generative AI applications and build large language models and foundation models, all with the privacy, reliability and security they have grown accustomed to with AWS. AWS' operating income was $7.2 billion, an increase of $2 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.6%, up more than 500 basis points year-over-year and effectively flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\nThis margin improvement reflects our headcount reductions from earlier in the year and a slowdown in the pace of hiring. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $35.5 billion, an improvement of $48.3 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we are seeing across all three of our segments. We're also seeing improvements in working capital, notably in inventory efficiency driven by our regionalization efforts. Next, let's turn to capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, full year CapEx was $48.4 billion, which was down $10.2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by lower spend on fulfillment and transportation.\nAs we look forward to 2024, we anticipate CapEx to increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models. One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from 5 years to 6 years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers.\nWith that, let's move on to questions.\nSee also 25 Largest Banks in the US by Total Deposits and 24 Countries Where You Can Retire on Just Social Security in 2024.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n"

        "Author": "  Sweta Killa ",
        "Text": "E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN joined the blue-chip index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA on Feb 26.The reshuffle reflects the ongoing shift in economic power from traditional brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce and technology-driven companies. The inclusion of Amazon in the Dow marks a significant milestone in the recognition of the e-commerce giant's influence and its role in the broader market.The shift was prompted by Walmart's WMT decision to execute a 3-to-1 stock split, which has reduced its stock's weighting in the index. The Dow is a price-weighted index. So, stocks that fetch higher prices are given more weight. Amazon's addition has increased consumer retail exposure within the index, alongside enhancing the representation of various other business sectors that Amazon engages in, including cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence, among others (read: Walmart Soars on Earnings, Dividend & Vizio Deal: ETFs to Buy).Amazon took the 17th position in the index, while Walmart's weighting dropped to 26 from 17. UnitedHealth Group remained the most heavily weighted stock in the index. Amazon's entry into the Dow Jones is not just a symbolic change but a reflection of the evolving priorities and dynamics within the investment world. It signals a broader recognition of the value and impact of technology and e-commerce sectors, encouraging investors to perhaps rethink their investment approaches in light of these trends.While the Dow Jones is making new record highs, its performance is lagging behind the S&P and Nasdaq over the past year. The underperformance is due to the lack of exposure in tech stocks and the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies in particular. The Dow includes two of the Magnificent Seven \u2014 Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. Amazon will be the third. As such, the addition of Amazon will help Dow Jones catch up with the S&P 500 gains. The shares of the commerce giant have surged more than 80% over the past year (read: ETFs to Tap on Amazon's Strong Q4 Earnings).\u00a0 \u00a0Given this, investors seeking to tap the potential strength in the Dow Jones trend could consider SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, iShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF IYY, Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJD and First Trust Dow 30 Equal Weight ETF EDOW.\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA)SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $33.1 billion and an average daily volume of 3.8 million shares.
