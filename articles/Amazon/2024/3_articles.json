        "Title": "Amazon collects $140 billion in annual fees from sellers. Now many are fuming over \u2018crazy\u2019 new fees they say tighten Amazon\u2019s grip on their businesses",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Things are about to get more complicated for many Amazon sellers\u2014and Amazon customers may pay the price, literally.\nOver the next month, Amazon is implementing the latest in a series of new fees for businesses that sell goods on Amazon, in changes that the company says are designed to speed up shipping speeds for Amazon customers while reducing the costs of such initiatives. But a half-dozen top Amazon sellers told Fortune this week that the new fees are complex and expensive, and may force them to overhaul their businesses and seriously consider ceding more control of their supply chain to the tech giant at a time when it is facing a government lawsuit that alleges the company is already abusing its power over these merchants.\nAll of these sellers told Fortune that at least one of the new fees\u2014called \u201cthe inbound placement service fee\u201d\u2014appears designed to pressure merchants to utilize a new Amazon service called AWD, or Amazon Warehousing and Distribution. Some of these merchants also said that this fee, coupled with another that Amazon will soon charge for low inventory levels, will force them to pass on price increases to Amazon customers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to sell on Amazon,\u201d said Albert Grazi, a highly-rated Amazon seller of seven years who sells around $5 million of water filtration products on Amazon each year through brands like the Mist filter line. \u201cYou are getting squeezed from all sides.\u201d\nAn Amazon spokesperson, Mira Dix, said in a statement: \u201cBy splitting what was a combined outbound fee into an inbound and outbound fee and adding a low-inventory-level fee, we will more closely align fees for sellers with our underlying costs while also providing sellers with more choices for how they use our services, giving them more transparency and control over their fulfillment costs. This allows us to create incentives for sellers to use our network more efficiently so we can share the cost savings.\u201d\nThe spokesperson said that \u201cmany\u201d sellers will end up paying Amazon less per unit sold than they did previously, but none of the six top sellers who spoke to Fortune considered that a possibility for their business.\nWhile Amazon is increasingly thought of as a tech giant as much as a retailer\u2014with significant AI investments, a massive cloud computing business in AWS, and a voice assistant that\u2019s become a household name\u2014about one-quarter of its total revenue, or $140 billion in 2023 alone\u2014comes from the fees it charges these sellers to host their products and do the unsexy work of storing and shipping their goods. In exchange, small companies can build big businesses by easily accessing one of the largest customer bases in the world. But now Amazon wants even more.\nIn recent years, Amazon has extracted a greater cut of sales from the small and midsize merchants who sell through its site, even as Amazon\u2019s reliance on these sellers continues to grow. During the final three months of 2023, the proportion of total goods sold through Amazon that come from these sellers\u2014rather than Amazon\u2019s own inventory\u2014crossed the 60% mark for the first time in company history. At the same time, from 2017 to 2022, the cut of revenue that Amazon takes from these sellers increased from around 40% to around 50%, according to the e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse.\nSellers pay Amazon listing fees, advertising fees, and in many cases warehousing, shipping, and customer service fees through a service called Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, that assures their items will qualify for Prime shipping. Amazon\u2019s third-party seller business\u2014known as its Marketplace\u2014is also highly profitable, the Federal Trade Commission has alleged, but just how profitable remains a secret that the company does not disclose.\nThe new inbound placement and low-inventory fees apply to sellers who already use FBA, but Amazon wants to play a role even earlier in their supply chain. In the past, an Amazon seller might import goods from overseas suppliers and then send all that inventory to a warehouse owned by a 3PL or third-party logistics company. From there, the 3PL will then ship out smaller segments of the seller\u2019s inventory to Amazon fulfillment centers and potentially those of other retailers. But with Amazon Warehouse and Distribution, or AWD, Amazon is essentially trying to replace those 3PLs. (Amazon also runs another relatively new service called Amazon Global Logistics, or AGL, that charges sellers to transport a seller\u2019s goods from overseas suppliers into a US Amazon fulfillment center.)\nOver the past two years, Amazon has also reorganized\u2014or regionalized\u2014its U.S. warehouse network to try to share inventory across eight regions to speed up delivery times and reduce transportation costs, in an effort to get more goods to customer doors faster and cheaper. With these new changes, if an Amazon seller is not willing to send goods from its own 3PL warehouse to at least four different Amazon fulfillment centers, Amazon will now charge an extra fee for every single item. The new placement fees will range anywhere from 21 cents to 68 cents per unit for standard-size goods, and 55 cents to $6 for bulky products. Pricing is based not only on the size and weight of an item, but also depending on how many fulfillment centers a seller will or won\u2019t ship their items to. Of course, Amazon will waive these new fees if sellers decide to pay for AWD instead.\nGrazi, the Amazon seller, said it makes sense for Amazon to begin charging sellers to spread their inventory across the U.S. But, to him, the costs don\u2019t net out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very high fee,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn't make sense how much money they are charging.\u201d\nJudah Bergman, the CEO of Jool Baby, a baby-product company that does tens of millions in sales on Amazon annually, says the introduction of these new fees and others announced in December feel like \u201c10 years\u2019 worth of increases and changes in one.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very experienced on Amazon and I\u2019ve spent so much time on this,\u201d he said, \u201c[but] for many items, I still don\u2019t have clarity on how exactly I\u2019m going to sell profitably yet. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nBeyond the new inbound placement fees that go into effect March 1, on April 1 Amazon will also begin charging many sellers a fee if they don\u2019t have four weeks of inventory in Amazon fulfillment centers. One problem, sellers told Fortune, is that Amazon also charges sellers for storing too much inventory in Amazon facilities.\n\u201cYou gotta precisely thread the needle to not get completely killed,\u201d Bergman, the Jool Baby CEO, said of the low-inventory charges.\nAmazon\u2019s solution? Again, sellers can avoid the low-inventory fees by giving Amazon even more control of their supply chain by utilizing AWD to replace a seller\u2019s existing 3PL warehouse relationship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear they are carrot-and-stick-ing us into using AWD,\u201d said a longtime, eight-figure apparel seller who requested anonymity out of a fear of reprisal for speaking candidly about Amazon\u2019s actions.\nDifferent sellers had different reasons for not wanting to use AWD. Some simply didn\u2019t want to give more control to Amazon, while another said they believe their current 3PL relationship will be cheaper. Two others said they\u2019ve heard from peers who felt the service was not yet ready for prime time.\nSeveral of the sellers who spoke to Fortune said that the company\u2019s marketplace has become a safer place to do business over the past year or two, with the company doing a better job of policing nefarious merchants who sabotage competitor listings. But the recent fee changes have them feeling resigned to the fact that a significant power imbalance remains.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna comply and send [my inventory] into AWD,\u201d Grazi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it.\u201d\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAmazon (AMZN) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 7.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 40.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 23.9%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -9.2%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.9%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Amazon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.8% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Amazon well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "What Does Amazon Want With Nuclear?",
        "Author": "  Matthew Zeitlin ",
        "Text": "When Talen Energy, which owns a 90% interest in the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Northeastern Pennsylvania, announced it was selling a data center site adjacent to its power plant to Amazon Web Services, it raised some eyebrows in the energy world. The surprise was not because a large tech company made a big deal with a carbon-free power provider, or even that a tech company made a deal to buy power generated by a nuclear power plant. It was because Amazon was making this deal.\nAmazon is a massive buyer of renewable power \u2014 it claims to be the world\u2019s largest and says it\u2019s responsible for 28 gigawatts of clean energy capacity \u2014 signing contracts with new wind and solar projects all over the world.\nBut a divide has opened up among tech giants when it comes to energy, with Amazon on one side and Alphabet and Microsoft on the other. The difference hinges on how much it matters where and when the new carbon-free power a company buys in order to match its electricity use.\nWhat\u2019s odd about the Talen deal is that it fits awkwardly into either approach, especially Amazon\u2019s. Amazon does not count nuclear towards its renewable power goals, and in any case, it\u2019s not a \u201cnew\u201d source of carbon-free power. Instead, it allows Amazon to siphon somewhere between 480 and 960 megawatts of capacity from the 2,500 megawatt plant.\n\u201cAmazon needs power, they\u2019re getting it at cheap rates. They don\u2019t even want to talk about it like a climate thing,\u201d Mark Nelson, the founder of Radiant Energy Group, told me.\nIn the past decade or so, technology companies have gone on a clean-power buying spree, funding new wind and solar projects all over the world. But there has been a divergence in what is thought to be the best way to go about it.\nIn 2019, Amazon announced a goal to add enough renewable power to the grid to match its own emissions by 2030 (since moved up to 2025) and to reach net zero by 2040.\nGoogle has been 100% renewable in terms of buying clean power in the same amounts that it consumes since 2017. So in 2020, it set a new goal: to \u201crun on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030.\u201d This would mean not just matching total renewable purchases with total emissions, as Amazon is seeking to do, but also trying to get every hour of data center operation \u201cmatched\u201d with an hour of renewable generation on the same grid.\nMicrosoft has a similar goal, and as a result, both companies have shown much more interest in nuclear power of late than is typical in the technology world.\n\u201cA huge bottleneck for growth for Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook is access to constant electricity,\u201d Nelson told me. Nuclear is a carbon-free electricity resource that can run at a steady output 24 hours a day, whereas wind and solar are both inherently variable.\nMicrosoft signed a deal with Constellation to supply power to data centers in Virginia and hired an official from the Tennessee Valley Authority to be its director of nuclear and energy innovations, while Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Sam Altman, the head of Microsoft-backed OpenAI have both invested in nuclear startups, as has Google.\nAmazon\u2019s approach \u2014 which it shares with several other large companies, including Meta \u2014 is not to match 24 hours of its operations with clean power bought locally, but rather to develop and purchase new wind and solar at the same scale of the power it consumes, especially in areas with dirty grids, thus matching the emissions from its consumption with the emissions reductions of new renewables projects. While a 24/7 matching approach may be naturally complementary with nuclear power, Amazon\u2019s strategy doesn\u2019t require it.\n\u201cWe believe a focus on emissions is the fastest, most cost-effective and scalable way to leverage corporate clean energy procurement to help decarbonize global power grids at the fastest pace,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson told me. \u201cThis includes procuring renewable energy in locations and countries that still rely heavily on fossil fuels to power their grids, and where energy projects can have the biggest impact on carbon reduction.\u201d\nContracting out new renewable energy projects can have more bang for your buck in dirty grids, according to proponents of the Amazon philosophy, known as carbon matching. The hypothesis is that a renewable project in a fossil fuel-heavy grid will displace more dirty power than one that\u2019s located near a datacenter in an already relatively clean grid like California or Washington State.\nPrinceton researchers who examined the carbon matching (Amazon) and temporal matching (Google and Microsoft) strategies argued that the carbon matching approach does not necessarily lead to more renewables \u2014 or less fossil fuels \u2014 on the grid than would have occurred in the absence of the tech companies, and thus does not actually greatly lower emissions. The temporal approach, on the other hand, can meaningfully displace fossil fuel power that would otherwise have to be on the grid to meet demand.\nNuclear advocates are clear-eyed that this deal won\u2019t cause a new generating unit to sprout up out of the Susquehanna Valley. But they still see it as the kind of deal that can help ensure nuclear plants\u2019 continued survival. Amazon\u2019s $650 million buys it a 10-year agreement to purchase power from the plant, as well as \u201cadditional revenue from AWS related to sales of carbon-free energy to the grid,\u201d which an Amazon spokesperson explained as a reference to the deal \u201censur[ing] that the nuclear plant has stable revenues to continue generating clean power to the grid for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nNelson, a passionate advocate for nuclear power, lamented the mass shutdown of nuclear power plants in the 2010s thanks to cheap natural gas knocking them out of power markets that didn\u2019t value reliability or carbon-free energy. But now, he says, things are different.\n\u201cNow nuclear is getting valued for its climate properties, reliability, and low cost. We\u2019re seeing nuclear plants cash in,\u201d Nelson told me. \u201cLong term PPAs with cold hard cash help me sleep better at night.\u201d\nRead more at Heatmap News:The Quest to Ban the Best Raincoats in the WorldWe Fact Checked Everything Trump Has Said About Climate Change Since 2021Or sign up to receive our best story in your inbox every day here.\n"

        "Title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Amazon Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Amazon (AMZN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AMZN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nAmazon's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Amazon's main business drivers.\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.Its online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company\u2019s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish footprint in physical grocery supermarket space. \nAmazon also enjoys dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin generating businesses. \nAmazon has also become a household name with its Alexa powered Echo devices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa is helping the company sell products and services.\nRevenues were $574.8 billion in 2023. The company reports revenue under three broad heads\u2014North America, International and AWS, which generated 61.4%, 22.8% and 15.8% of total revenues, respectively.\nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, Amazon targets three categories of customers\u2014consumers, sellers and website developers. Consumers are offered variety, convenience and free delivery of goods displayed on the company\u2019s websites.The agreements with sellers are varied, enabling them to use the company\u2019s websites to either sell their merchandise directly, or redirect customers to the sellers\u2019 own branded websites. In case of the latter arrangement, Amazon earns a fee for the sales thus generated.\nCompetition comes in the form of traditional retailers, other online retailers, media companies, web portals, search engines, e-commerce companies and cloud computing service providers.\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Amazon ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in March 2014 would be worth $9,565.47, or an 856.55% gain, as of March 15, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nThe S&P 500 rose 179.75% and the price of gold increased 50.53% over the same time frame in comparison.\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for AMZN.\nAmazon\u2019s fourth quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. The stock has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings remains tailwinds. Amazon\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, macroeconomic challenges remain concerns.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.27%, and there have been 16 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Title": "7 Stocks That Could Be the Next Amazon or Google: March 2024 Edition",
        "Author": "  Thomas Niel ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains the undisputed king of e-commerce. Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to dominate the search advertising market. With this, you may think it\u2019s a challenge to figure out which are the stocks that could be the next Amazon or Google.\nWhen it comes to the relatively smaller U.S.-based tech companies, few appear possible Amazon or Google \u201ckillers.\u201d\nSome, like Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR), could become top dogs in sectors like AI enterprise software, but it\u2019s hard to see a new U.S. e-commerce or search advertising powerhouse emerging.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nHowever, taking a look at major international tech names, there are a few stocks that could be the next Amazon or Google. Let\u2019s take a look at each one, and see why.\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\nAlibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) has been China\u2019s answer to Amazon, but investor confidence in BABA has admittedly waned considerably in recent years.\nChina\u2019s tech crackdown, plus the country\u2019s \u201cZero COVID\u201d policies during 2022 and 2023, have both severely affected Alibaba\u2019s fiscal performance, as well as the performance of BABA shares.\nHowever, after sliding from over $300 to the low-$70s per share since 2020, now may be the time to make a long-term wager on BABA stock. Yes, the stock\u2019s valuation (8.5 times forward earnings) makes sense given forecasts calling for little in the way of earnings growth next fiscal year (ending March 2025).\nStill, if Chinese economic challenges ease, Alibaba could experience a growth recovery. In turn, spurring a market rerating. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Alex Siriois argued earlier this month, the company\u2019s big move into generative AI is a massive potential growth catalyst for BABA.\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\nSimilar to Alibaba being considered \u201cChina\u2019s Amazon,\u201d Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has been called \u201cChina\u2019s Google,\u201d going as far back as the search engine and streaming company\u2019s IPO nearly twenty years ago.\nMany may argue that the opportunity for BIDU stock to become one of the stocks that could be the next Amazon or Google has come and gone.\nAfter all, despite the \u201cChina\u2019s Google\u201d moniker, Baidu (with a $36.4 billion) is significantly smaller than Alphabet (with a $1.85 trillion market cap). Baidu\u2019s growth has also stalled in recent years. Baidu\u2019s growth prospects may already be improving.\nAt least, based upon the initial success with its generative AI endeavors. Ernie Bot, a chatbot similar to that of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, has already started to become a revenue generator.\nSubsequent news could lead to \u2018AI mania\u2019 for BIDU, which right now trades at a supercheap 9.2 times forward earnings.\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is another China-based \u201cAmazon killer\u201d contender. Both country specific tail winds mentioned has affected shares in this Chinese e-commerce giant above, as well as concerns that JD.com is falling behind its domestic peers.\nHowever, the company is pursuing a path to growth, hinging largely on international expansion.\nThere is great uncertainty regarding JD.com\u2019s global growth gambit, yet this may be more than accounted for, in the valuation of JD stock. Shares trade for only 8.5 times earnings. This comes despite JD.com starting to turn things around.\nGlobal growth is a work-in-progress, but a newfound focus on sales promotions may have played a role in JD\u2019s revenue beat for Q4 2023. Analysts are now anticipating double-digit earnings growth during 2025 and 2026. Bouncing back since the start of March, the JD recovery could carry on in the months ahead.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nAfter looking at three Chinese stocks that could be the next Amazon or Google, let\u2019s take a look at MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), considered to be \u201cLatin America\u2019s Amazon.\u201d\nActually, MercadoLibre is not only an e-commerce powerhouse.\nAs I discussed previously, it\u2019s also a fintech powerhouse as well. MercadoLibre\u2019s fintech units blend well with the company\u2019s e-commerce operations, and provide another growth catalyst for MELI stock. Investors have long been aware of MELI\u2019s long-term potential, resulting in shares sporting a rich valuation.\nHowever, as a Barron\u2019s commentator recently argued, MercadoLibre\u2019s post-earnings sell-off has created a solid entry point for a position.\nWith e-commerce market penetration still fairly low in Latin America (10%), and with the company perhaps having a deeper competitive moat in its home markets than Amazon does in the U.S., even after surging by nearly 1500% over the past decade, MELI shares may have more room to run.\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) was formerly known as Pinduoduo, which is also the name of PDD\u2019s flagship China-based e-commerce platform.\nHowever, a more important aspect to the PDD growth story, especially in terms of it becoming a formidable competitor to Amazon, is the success thus far with PDD\u2019s Temu e-commerce site.\nWhile Pinduoduo\u2019s resilience in a sluggish Chinese economy played a role, Temu\u2019s success overseas, particularly in the U.S., was a major factor in PDD\u2019s earnings beat for the preceding quarter. Yes, alongside achieving success stateside, Temu has also been the subject of controversy.\nYet even as PDD looks to reduce Temu\u2019s reliance on the U.S. market (due to growing geopolitical tensions), pivoting toward markets in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia could prove just as successful. With analysts expecting continued high growth, shares are a bargain, at 16.7 times forward earnings.\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock\nYou likely knew about most of the stocks that could be the next Amazon or Google listed above, but you may be less familiar with Singapore-based Sea Ltd. (NYSE:SE). Sea can is a tech holding company.\nSea\u2019s interests include online gaming (via its Garena platform), e-commerce (through its Shopee unit), as well as fintech (through its SeaMoney unit).\nSE stock tumbled during the 2022 tech sell-off. However, shares may be embarking on a comeback. Over the past month, SE has surged.\nLargely, because of a well-received earnings release, which included news of Sea achieving its first full year of profitability. Sea\u2019s growth is also picking back up. This could lead to significant earnings growth, per analyst earnings forecasts. Even at a somewhat pricey 31 times forward earnings, SE is another possible AMZN or GOOG in the making that you should consider buying.\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is another long-standing China-based competitor to America\u2019s Big Tech giants.\nThis stock offers exposure to most major segments of China\u2019s tech sector, including social media, video streaming, fintech, telehealth, and more recently, to the fast-growing gen AI space.\nLast year, Tencent debuted its Hunyuan large language AI model. In the near-term, China\u2019s economic challenges could continue to affect this company\u2019s fiscal performance, as was the case last quarter.\nHowever, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Thomas Yeung pointed out last month, Tencent remains on good terms with the Chinese government. This bodes well for its AI prospects, as China pursues \u201cAI nationalism.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not all. Irrespective of governmental policy, Tencent\u2019s integration of AI will probably enhance the operating performance of its various digital-based businesses. Although trading at a premium to peers like BABA, at 13.1 times forward earnings, TCEHY stock appears more than reasonably priced considering the bullish factors.\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this online retailer have returned +11% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of +161.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +18.1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +40%. This estimate has changed +10.8% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.30 indicates a change of +30.5% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +10%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $142.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.8%. The $641.11 billion and $715.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.5% and +11.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "More than a decade after first offering loans to merchants who sell goods through its online marketplaces, the Amazon Lending division will cease underwriting its own loans to merchants, according to an email sent to some sellers that was viewed by Fortune.\nAmazon spokesperson Deniz Sonmez confirmed the news in an email to Fortune.\n\u201cWe regularly evaluate our programs and services, and have made the decision to discontinue term loans underwritten by Amazon for Amazon sellers in the U.S. and U.K.,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis change will begin to take effect March 6, 2024.\u201d\nSonmez couldn\u2019t immediately comment on any regions where Amazon will continue to underwrite loans.\nAmazon Lending will continue to service existing loans for sellers that the company has already underwritten, as well as those that have recently been offered to sellers. But no new loan offers will be made.\nThe spokesperson added that Amazon will still market financing solutions offered by other \u201ctrusted third-party providers with deep experience in lending and servicing financing programs.\u201d\nLast year, Business Insider reported that some economists working at Amazon had raised concerns about the level of defaults that the program was exposing Amazon to.\n\u201cThe increased uncertainty of business repayment ability\u201d by sellers \u201cnecessitates higher inspection of our on\u2013balance sheet credit/lending products,\u201d noted the document viewed by Business Insider.\nBut at the time, an Amazon spokesperson seemed to dismiss the internal concerns saying, \u201cThe document in question does not reflect the company\u2019s position on the economy and where it\u2019s headed \u2026 This document simply reflects the thoughts of some of our economists.\u201d\nPerhaps not.\nAmazon had initially pulled back drastically on loan offers during the early days of pandemic, but eventually reversed course.\nAmazon began offering loans of thousands of dollars to select U.S.-based sellers back in 2011, providing funds quicker than a typical bank might and automatically deducting repayments from a merchant\u2019s Amazon account. Independent sellers are the invisible secret behind the massive selection on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, accounting for more than 60% of all goods sold on Amazon for the first time ever in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAmazon generated $140 billion in revenue last year from fees it charges sellers for everything from listing products for sale, to handling storage and shipping of orders, to loans. Last week Fortune reported that many top Amazon sellers are furious about a new slate of fees that Amazon recently announced, requiring sellers to either start using an additional Amazon warehousing service or pay additional new fees.\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Text": "Amazon has come a long way since its humble roots. Originally founded as an online bookseller, Amazon is now the go-to name in e-commerce, selling everything from ballpoint pens to prefabricated houses.\nFind Out: One Smart Way To Grow Your Retirement Savings in 2024  Check Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nThe company is the fourth largest in the entire S&P 500, with a market capitalization of a whopping $1.812 trillion as of March 18.\nInvestors who have stuck with the stock through thick and thin have been handsomely rewarded, in spite of occasional bouts of unsettling volatility. But if you had invested only in Amazon 10 years ago, would you have enough to retire today? How about for those looking ahead to the next 10 years? Read on to learn more about the performance of this amazing stock.\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nOver the last 10 years, Amazon stock has been a beast, returning roughly 856% to investors. That amounts to almost nine times your initial investment in a single decade. That return far outweighs that of the S&P 500, which managed a still impressive 174% over the same period.\nLearn More: If You Had Invested $10K in GameStop and AMC in 2021, Here\u2019s How Much You\u2019d Have Today\nAn investor who prudently chose to invest $100,000 in Amazon 10 years ago would be richly rewarded as of today. That $100,000 would have turned into roughly $856,000, just shy of the mythical $1 million figure many shoot for in their nest eggs.\u00a0A small bump to $120,000 would be enough to push you over the $1 million mark.\nEven an investor who set aside \u201conly\u201d $50,000 into Amazon stock 10 years ago would have a huge leg up when it came to their retirement savings. A $50,000 investment would now be worth roughly $428,000. Someone who was able to sock away $150,000 likely would be able to live a comfortable retirement, as that initial investment would now be worth $1,284,000.\nMost analysts don\u2019t create 10-year stock forecasts, as there are too many variables to include. The 47 Wall Street analysts who cover Amazon have a consensus \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target of $208.48. This represents a 16.6% increase over the March 14 price of $178.75.\nAnalysts at Coin Price Forecast do offer a 2034 projection for Amazon stock, estimating a 10-year price increase of 276%, to $672 per share.\nThere are three primary reasons Amazon may continue to grow.\nThe first is its barriers to entry. Although anyone can set up an online store, Amazon has the reputation, the clout and the logistics to keep it the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Many traditional retailers still struggle to get customers in the door, but Amazon offers nearly anything to anyone 24/7 from the comfort of their own homes.\nIn addition to the overall growth in online shopping, Amazon stands to benefit both from digital advertising and from its Amazon Web Services division. The advertising segment is fairly new for Amazon and is thus far demonstrating high growth, while AWS already controls more than one-third of the world\u2019s cloud computing service revenue.\nLastly, Amazon isn\u2019t that expensive on a historic basis, unlike some of its tech stock brethren that have run up to stratospheric valuations. Amazon currently trades at about 3.2 times sales, which is just about where it has been over the past 10 years on average. While certainly not a \u201ccheap\u201d stock \u2014 it still carries a price/earnings ratio of about 61 times \u2014 it\u2019s about in line with its long-term average valuation.\nThere are plenty of other reasons investors might continue to buy Amazon as well. In addition to its push into AI, the stock recently joined the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, marking it as a true \u201cblue chip stock\u201d in the eyes of many investors.\nIf you believe in the long-term growth story of Amazon, it\u2019s certainly not too late to add it to your portfolio. This is particularly true if you are a younger investor, as your money will have additional time to compound.\nIf Amazon kept pace with the overall market and its 10% long-term average annual return, just $175 per month, starting at age 25, would be enough to net you over $1.1 million if you retire at 65.\nIf Amazon could return 16.6% per year, as analysts estimate over the coming 12 months, that monthly $175 investment would jump to an incredible $9.2 million. Even if you waited to start until age 35, a 16.6% annual return could net you over $1.7 million on your modest $175 monthly investment.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nFrugal People Love the 6 to 1 Grocery Shopping Method: Here's Why It Works\n6 Cities Where Social Security Goes the Farthest for Retirees\nThe 6 Smartest Things to Do With Your Tax Refund\n7 Ways Fraudsters Are Trying to Scam People in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much You Had To Invest In Amazon 10 Years Ago To Retire Today\n"

        "Title": "Amazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s private cargo airline, Amazon Air, took a different approach with its North American and European networks during the past 12 months. It has been streamlining operations in the U.S. by prioritizing larger planes and major hubs, but relying less on hubs in Europe as flight activity decreases, according to a report published Thursday.\nThe air logistics unit\u2019s meteoric growth has ended after seven years, but the company was able to maintain operating levels at a time when many cargo airlines, including FedEx and UPS, parked aircraft and reduced flights in response to the downturn in air cargo demand.\nPerhaps more noteworthy, Amazon Air (NASDAQ: AMZN) largely kept its fleet and flight schedule intact even as growth in e-commerce sales normalized and the mega-retailer shifted to a regional fulfillment model that decreases reliance on air transport.\nThe report from the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University described how Amazon has 4.6% more payload capacity than a year ago despite having one fewer plane. It has also mostly transitioned to a hub-and-spoke model that mirrors FedEx and UPS, with less point-to-point flying. While total daily flights fell by 1.8%, to 202 per day, Amazon Air\u2019s available ton-miles grew.\n\nThe researchers, led by Chaddick Institute Director Joseph Schwieterman, relied on geospatial mapping with flight tracking data for their analysis.\nMore than four in five Amazon Air flights within the U.S. mainland operate to or from its five largest hubs, up from 65.6% in early 2021. Flight activity at four of its five busiest hubs \u2014 Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky (CVG); San Bernardino, California; Ohio\u2019s Wilmington Air Park; and Florida\u2019s Lakeland-Linder \u2014 all grew over the past year.\nOnly Fort Worth Alliance Airport in Texas diminished in flight activity, a result researchers attributed to Amazon\u2019s decision to discontinue use of five ATR-72 turboprop aircraft operated by Silver Airways and which accounted for a tiny fraction of the terminal\u2019s tonnage.\nAmazon relies on partner carriers, such as Silver, to operate its network because it isn\u2019t a pure airline with its own operating authority. Amazon\u2019s active fleet has plateaued in the past 18 months at about 80 aircraft, according to various aircraft databases. But during the peak of pandemic home shopping the fleet reached 88 aircraft.\n\nLakeland is now Amazon\u2019s second-largest hub, with nearly 21 flights per day.\nThe Ohio Valley has become Amazon Air\u2019s strategic center, accounting for more than half the flights in the U.S. mainland. After initially borrowing space from DHL Express, Amazon opened its own $1.5 billion facility at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky airport. Flights at CVG increased from 57.5 to 63.3 per day in the past 12 months, not including about six flights by unmarked partner carriers, according to the report. Wilmington Air Park, only 60 miles away, handles 20 flights per day. Concentrating flights at the Cincinnati hub, and clustering them into two tight arrival and departure blocks, allows for efficient plane-to-plane transfers that support overnight delivery.\nAmazon Air still lags FedEx and UPS in proficiency, with turnaround times for aircraft of about five hours versus two to three hours for the integrated logistics providers, the Chaddick report said. At 8 years old, Amazon Air is still maturing. FedEx and UPS have operated air transport networks with huge hubs for decades.\nDitching the small turboprops was one of several adjustments Amazon made to its freighter fleet to better align the network with consumer demand and the renewed emphasis on regional order fulfillment. E-commerce sales in 2023 increased 7.6% to $1.1 trillion \u2014 more than three times the rate of growth for total retail sales. Last year, online shopping accounted for 15.4% of total sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. After exploding 43% during the first year of the pandemic, annual e-commerce sales growth is expected to be less than 10% in the coming years.\nAmazon returned five Boeing 767-200 freighters because the lease expired and they were old. (It is scheduled to give back an additional seven 767-200s next month, the lessor recently said.) Meanwhile, Amazon added three 767-300 planes, all operated by contractor Air Transport International, and its first Airbus A330-300, operated by Hawaiian Airlines. In the process, the percentage of the fleet consisting of Boeing 737 or smaller planes, has fallen from 38% to 33% over the past year.\nAmazon has signed leases for nine more A330-300 converted freighters, which are larger than the 767 widebodies.\nThe Silver Airways freighters \u2014 and air service to Des Moines, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; and Wichita, Kansas \u2014 became expendable as Amazon moved to a fully regional, rather than national, fulfillment model. With orders distributed from eight regions, a good truck linehaul can perform as well as aircraft in key city pairs at lower cost with little to no impact for customers in small markets, logistics experts say.\nIn its effort to simplify the U.S. network, Amazon Air also ended regular flights to Mobile, Alabama; San Jose, California; and Tampa, Florida. Tampa is less than an hour\u2019s drive from Lakeland-Linder airport. The company also halved air service to Las Vegas, which is less than four hours by truck from its San Bernardino hub, and cut service by about a third at Baltimore-Washington airport, which is a 7.5-hour drive from the Wilmington hub.\n\nLast month, Amazon gave notice it is pulling out of San Antonio\u2019s airport, closing on April 10. Amazon has air service to Austin, Texas, which is only an hour from San Antonio by truck. By April, Amazon will be in 47 U.S. airports, down from 53 last year.\nIn 2022, Amazon restructured fulfillment operations and transportation networks across the U.S., dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed the retailer to better utilize close-by inventory, while reducing stops per package and decreasing reliance on air transportation. Amazon says shortening the distance that deliveries have to travel to reach customers and improving inventory placement have helped achieve the fastest-ever shipping speeds.\nAmazon always placed some inventory in regional warehouses to improve delivery times and reduce cost, according to a former Amazon executive who asked not to be named, but has now engineered its entire logistics network around that model. That means distribution centers have a limited mix of products available for same-day or next-day delivery. If a shopper, especially in a non-major metro area, wants a ruffled bed sheet instead of a standard one, he or she may have to wait more than two days for it to be shipped from a larger distribution center farther away.\nTrucks do well for short and medium lengths of haul to less populated areas because customers have learned to accept that a special delivery may take longer, or that the order cutoff time may be earlier for day-definite delivery, the industry source said. In this scenario, freighters become more of a luxury used to enhance customer satisfaction with a speedy delivery from one regional center to another when there is a mismatch in regional inventory levels.\n\u201cI would argue that some of these 737s that they fly, say from Dallas to New Orleans, are not necessary because nothing you\u2019re flying on short haul is profitable,\u201d the individual said.\nThe report noted that Amazon is increasingly reluctant to deploy many flights at passenger-focused airports that are crowded and have limited room for warehouse expansion. Chicago-Rockford, Lehigh Valley airport in Pennsylvania and Sacramento airport in California have picked up flights while flights have diminished, or stayed flat, at Chicago O\u2019Hare, New York John F. Kennedy and San Francisco airports.\nA Chaddick Institute report last August found that cargo-focused airports outside large metropolitan areas give freighter operators several advantages, including faster shipment discharge and developable land for cargo facilities.\nWhile Amazon Air slightly increased U.S. capacity and added a handful of daily flights in Canada and India, flight activity in Europe dropped by more than a third over the past year. That followed a 29% reduction in flights in 2022. Reductions included flights carried out by partner airlines using their own unbranded aircraft. Amazon has about nine branded aircraft in its European fleet.\nLate last year, Amazon closed its regional air hub at Leipzig/Halle International Airport in Germany in response to a downturn in e-commerce sales and parcel volumes. Activity peaked in early 2022 at 18 flights per day, operated by contractor ASL Airlines Ireland using Boeing 737-800 converted freighters. All but one route was shifted to Hannover in northern Germany and Liege airport in Belgium. Leipzig now averages fewer than two Amazon flights per day.\nAmazon Air completely exited Germany\u2019s Cologne/Bonn airport in late 2022 and has sharply cut back flights at two U.K. airports in the aftermath of Brexit.\nThe network currently serves 10 airports, down from a high of 13 three years ago. More than 80% of Europe\u2019s population remains within 300 miles of an Amazon Air airport. Such distances can be covered within a day on a truck, the report says.\nAmazon\u2019s domestic fleet outperformed normal seasonality in February with the flight count up 13% year over year after being flat in January, according to the Alpha Parcel Tracker report from Morgan Stanley.\nThe Chaddick researchers predicted that in the next year Amazon Air will gradually begin to expand flight operations, mostly at its CVG national hub and four large regional hubs. By mid-2025, the combined daily flight activity at CVG and Wilmington will grow to more than 125, including partner flights, with CVG alone having at least 85. Nonhub flying will be simultaneously reduced.\nAmazon will remain relatively small in Europe, but it will grow again in a measured way, especially near where logistics infrastructure is being built, the report said. Potential growth areas include Scandinavia, Greece and the Balkan countries.\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.\nContact Reporter: ekulisch@freightwaves.com\u00a0\nPilots flying Amazon cargo say employer stalling contract talks\nAmazon\u2019s largest cargo jet makes debut\nAmazon\u2019s return of leased cargo jets hurts ATSG profit\nThe post Amazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) share price is up 98% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 74% (ignoring dividends).\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nDuring the last half decade, Amazon.com became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so investors may expect to see an increasing share price.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nIt's nice to see that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 83% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 15%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. If you would like to research Amazon.com in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.\nBut note: Amazon.com may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "The Federal Trade Commission has begun examining a new set of fees Amazon has recently levied on U.S. merchants selling goods through its online megastore, according to multiple sources familiar with the development. The agency\u2019s interest comes in the wake of Fortune\u2019s report last week that found many longtime Amazon sellers are furious about the fees.\nOne new fee requires sellers to either pay for a new Amazon warehousing service or begin shipping goods to at least four different warehouses on their own dime to avoid the fee. Another penalizes sellers if their inventory in Amazon warehouses consistently runs too low, unless they sign up for the same new Amazon warehousing service.\nSometime after the article was published, FTC staff began reaching out to Amazon sellers to learn more about the impact of the fees, according to multiple sources. It\u2019s unclear how many sellers have been contacted. It\u2019s also not yet clear what the exact goal of the inquiries is, but the FTC last year filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon that included claims of Amazon abusing its power over these sellers. Amazon is fighting the suit.\nFTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar declined to comment.\nAmazon spokesperson Mira Dix told Fortune that the new fee changes \u201callow sellers to choose where they want to have Amazon take on different aspects of fulfillment and where they want to do the work themselves. On average, the 2024 fee changes are significantly less than those announced by other major fulfillment services, and many sellers will see a decrease in the average fees paid to Amazon per unit sold.\u201d\nNone of the half dozen sellers Fortune spoke to last week expected their costs to decrease as a result of the changes, however.\nAmazon first announced these fees and other seller fee changes in December, and said they were designed to increase shipping speeds for Amazon customers, while reducing the costs of such initiatives.\u00a0But a half dozen top Amazon sellers told Fortune last week that the new fees are overly complex and expensive, and may force them to cede more control of their supply chain to the tech giant or raise prices for consumers buying their goods on Amazon.\nThe new fees apply to the majority of the hundreds of thousands of small and midsize businesses that sell goods on Amazon in the U.S., and that already pay Amazon to store and ship goods on their behalf through a program known as FBA, or Fulfillment by Amazon. FBA is the easiest way for sellers to guarantee that their goods carry the crucial Amazon Prime badge and are available for fast delivery.\nAmazon sellers accounted for more than 60% of items sold on the company\u2019s shopping sites during the holiday quarter, with the tech giant generating $140 billion in revenue from seller fees alone in 2023.\nLast week, Amazon sellers told Fortune that at least one of the new fees\u2014called \u201cthe inbound placement service fee\u201d\u2014appears designed to pressure merchants to utilize another Amazon warehousing service in addition to FBA, called AWD, or Amazon Warehousing and Distribution. The idea of AWD is to replace warehouses where Amazon sellers store their long-term inventory before they are shipped to Amazon\u2019s FBA warehouses or fulfillment centers to be packed into customer orders.\nSome of the business owners who spoke to Fortune also said that this new \u201cplacement fee,\u201d coupled with another that Amazon will soon charge for low-inventory levels, will force them to pass on price increases to Amazon customers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to sell on Amazon,\u201d Albert Grazi, a highly rated Amazon seller of seven years who sells around $5 million in water filtration products on Amazon annually, told Fortune last week. \u201cYou are getting squeezed from all sides.\u201d\nIn the days since the original Fortune report, the new fees have sparked impassioned discussions among sellers on LinkedIn, the popular wallstreetbets subreddit, as well as Amazon\u2019s own seller-focused message board. Some sellers have appeared blindsided by the news, while others have been sharing advice on potential workarounds. One involves applying for Merchant Fulfilled Prime, which allows a seller to store and ship their products on their own and still earn the Prime badge if they can hit a strict threshold of delivery performance.\nBeyond the new inbound placement fees, on April 1 Amazon will also begin charging most sellers a fee if they don\u2019t consistently have four weeks of inventory in Amazon fulfillment centers. One problem, sellers told Fortune, is that Amazon also charges sellers for storing too much inventory in Amazon facilities.\n\u201cYou gotta precisely thread the needle to not get completely killed,\u201d Judah Bergman, the CEO of a major Amazon seller called Jool Baby, said last week of the low-inventory charges.\nHowever, sellers can avoid the low-inventory fees by handing Amazon more control of their supply chain and utilizing the AWD service for long-term inventory storage.\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Amazon.com fair value estimate is US$241\nAmazon.com's US$178 share price signals that it might be 26% undervalued\nOur fair value estimate is 18% higher than Amazon.com's analyst price target of US$204\nHow far off is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$61.6b\nUS$77.6b\nUS$96.6b\nUS$103.9b\nUS$118.3b\nUS$129.0b\nUS$138.1b\nUS$145.8b\nUS$152.5b\nUS$158.5b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x18\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x9\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 9.04%\nEst @ 7.01%\nEst @ 5.60%\nEst @ 4.60%\nEst @ 3.91%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% \nUS$57.6k\nUS$67.7k\nUS$78.7k\nUS$79.1k\nUS$84.2k\nUS$85.7k\nUS$85.7k\nUS$84.5k\nUS$82.6k\nUS$80.2k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$786b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$158b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.1%\u2013 2.3%) = US$3.4t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.4t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$1.7t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.5t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$178, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.035. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "Title": "Analysis: Amazon sellers say their businesses are facing an extinction event\u2014they might not be wrong",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "This time is different.\nIn phone and text conversations with more than 20 longtime US-based Amazon sellers over the last several weeks, that was the common refrain Fortune heard again and again: this time is different.\n\u201cThis time\u201d refers to the latest class of fees levied on sellers by Amazon. More than 60% of the goods that Amazon sells across the globe are supplied by these small and mid-sized businesses, and Amazon already takes a cut of at least 50% on average from every sale when it handles the storage and shipping of a merchant\u2019s goods.\nNow the amount that merchants fork over to Amazon is likely to grow even more thanks to a couple of additional fees that have quickly become controversial enough that the Federal Trade Commission has begun probing them, as Fortune reported exclusively last week. The consistent message that long-time, level-headed sellers are sharing with each other? Selling on Amazon may soon be untenable.\nAnd as a result, many of these same business owners are forecasting something of an extinction event for Amazon sellers. The general category of third-party sellers won\u2019t vanish\u2014some hardy types and emergent breeds will always adapt and survive\u2014but for a great many existing sellers, the view is that the climate on planet Amazon may no longer be able to support life as they\u2019ve known it. The only question is which type of seller will be forced out of business (or at least, off of Amazon) first?\nWill it be the unsophisticated seller, struggling to predict how the new variable costs will affect its business? If this seller keeps its prices low, it might not realize the damage caused to its financials until it\u2019s too late.\nOr consider the plight of the sophisticated seller, who understands what\u2019s coming but finds itself in a bind. This seller may want to raise prices to account for Amazon\u2019s added fees. But that might not be possible if the seller is competing against rivals keeping prices low because they\u2019re either A. too inexperienced to understand the impact of the fees to their bottom lines, or B. based in China, and therefore utilizing Amazon cross-border supply chain services which may help them avoid the new fees.\nIn either scenario, things could get ugly.\n\u201cPeople are going to tend to underprice and just erode everyone\u2019s margins,\u201d said Bernie Thompson, who has been selling on Amazon since 2009 and is the founder of a top Amazon seller, the USB electronics brand Plugable. \u201cThere are going to be a bunch of bankruptcies.\u201d\nAmazon has said that the fee changes are significantly less than those announced by other major fulfillment services, and that many sellers will see a decrease in the average fees paid to Amazon per unit sold.\nThe fee changes \u201callow sellers to choose where they want to have Amazon take on different aspects of fulfillment and where they want to do the work themselves,\" Amazon spokesperson Mira Dix told Fortune last week.\nMany of the sellers who spoke to Fortune understand the rationale of at least one of the fees, known as the \u201cinbound placement fee,\u201d but disagree with the implementation and variability of the fees. In the past, Amazon sellers could ship a selection of their goods from their own warehouse \u2013 or one they essentially rent space in \u2013 to a single Amazon facility, and then Amazon might split up that inventory and ship to various facilities across the U.S. to get closer to Amazon customers. In these scenarios, Amazon would foot the bill to transport those goods between its own fulfillment centers.\nNow, as Amazon pushes to store more goods closer to customers in more U.S. regions while cutting its own costs, Amazon wants sellers to start footing the bill themselves. Amazon will charge sellers a new \u201cinbound placement fee\u201d per item if the seller won\u2019t pay to send their inventory to at least four Amazon facilities. (For smaller sellers who don\u2019t sell enough to even split between four facilities, it means they will likely pay some type of placement fee no matter what.)\nThe more warehouses a seller will ship to, the lower the fee. But the per-unit fee will change depending on how many warehouses Amazon makes available to a seller and where those warehouses are located. And only when a seller goes to create a shipment and Amazon displays the fees, can the business owner figure out the cost of shipping to the various warehouses locations to try to select the least expensive option for them.\nOne comment from a seller on Amazon\u2019s own seller forum captured some of the frustrations with the new complexities.\n\u201cArghh \u2014 I think you need a phD to be able to figure out the fees.\u201d\nSome sellers are equally frustrated with a new \u201clow inventory\u201d fee Amazon will charge sellers if they aren\u2019t stocking enough inventory in Amazon warehouses, especially considering Amazon also charges fees if you are storing too much stock in an Amazon facility. Substantial confusion also remains for merchants that sell goods that expire, and thus shouldn\u2019t be stocked too long, or for those that sell seasonal items.\nThe catch, of course, with both of the new fees is that there is one straightforward way around them: by paying Amazon for a new-ish warehouse service called Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD) to store long-term inventory. Sign up to use AWD and \u2013 voila \u2013 the inbound placement and low-inventory fees basically disappear. A pretty clear carrot-and-stick approach, as one seller called it, or a crumb-and-sledgehammer one if you are feeling less diplomatic.\nSome sellers told Fortune that they feel AWD is a suitable alternative, but many types of sellers couldn't switch to AWD even if they want to. Oversized products, for example, or products with an expiration date, can\u2019t be stored with AWD. What\u2019s more, some sellers already own or lease their own warehouse for long term storage, or have long term commitments with a third party logistics company that manages a storage facility for them. For them, Switching to AWD anytime soon isn\u2019t a realistic option.\nOn the surface, the new fees sure seem like a win-win for Amazon \u2014 the company can offset some of its costs through new fees or gain greater control of the supply chain when sellers opt for AWD. The increasing burden on sellers may be so much that many call it quits. But with hundreds of thousands of sellers, it will take a lot of seller failures before Amazon and its shopping experience feel any pain.\nAs a reporter who\u2019s been talking to Amazon sellers on a weekly basis for the past decade, I\u2019ve never before encountered this level of outrage and despair. Many of these small and mid-sized businesses \u2013 great SMB success stories who typically aren\u2019t afraid to praise the company \u2013 are now furious\u2026and desperate. Will Amazon hear their pleas?\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Amazon.com had debt of US$73.8b at the end of December 2023, a reduction from US$85.1b over a year. However, it does have US$86.8b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$13.0b.\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$164.9b due within a year, and liabilities of US$161.1b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$86.8b and US$46.4b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$192.8b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\nOf course, Amazon.com has a titanic market capitalization of US$1.87t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Amazon.com boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nEven more impressive was the fact that Amazon.com grew its EBIT by 176% over twelve months.

Talen Energy\u2019s Cumulus data center campus in Pennsylvania gets power from the Susquehanna nuclear plant, one of the largest nuclear power plants in the U.S. It will give Amazon a supply of clean carbon-free power, which the company could use to run energy-intensive artificial intelligence operations. The Wall Street Journal reported that AI searches require 10 times more computing power than regular searches. Amazon\u2019s new data center campus could give it a leg-up over other tech giants because \u201ccompanies looking to start data centers running AI face delays in getting permits to connect to grids, and long waits for the installation of transmission lines to connect utilities to their facilities.\u201d\nThirty cyclists died in New York City last year, the highest number since 1999, The New York Times reported, citing Department of Transportation data. Twenty-three of those killed were riding electric bikes, and most of them collided with vehicles in areas lacking proper cycling infrastructure. However the Times notes that a good portion (about one-third) of the e-bike riders who died were in solo crashes \u2013 accidents that did not involve cars or pedestrians, a trend that isn\u2019t seen among traditional bike-riders. \u201cThere may be a learning curve that some first-time e-bike riders aren\u2019t prepared for,\u201d said Sara Lind, an executive director at Open Plans. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that that learning curve, combined with the speed of the bike, exacerbates already confusing or chaotic conditions. Navigating a pothole or a suddenly blocked bike lane is more dangerous at a higher speed, emphasizing even more the need for better infrastructure as more people use e-bikes.\u201d Some e-bikes can reach speeds of 25 mph, though NYC is reducing the top speeds of electric Citi Bikes to 18 mph.\nThe world is on the cusp of the worst mass coral bleaching event in the history of the planet, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned. Climate change and El Ni\u00f1o have sent ocean temperatures soaring, and already \u201cthe Southern Hemisphere is basically bleaching all over the place,\u201d ecologist Derek Manzello, the coordinator of NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch, told Reuters. \u201cThe entirety of the Great Barrier Reef is bleaching. We just had reports that American Samoa is bleaching.\u201d Researchers believe a sustained global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius is a tipping point for mass coral reef die-off. Coral reef ecosystems provide a home to thousands of species of fish and other plants and animals, and are essential sources of food and income for millions of people around the world. NOAA notes that \u201cwhen a coral bleaches, it is not dead. Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to mortality.\u201d\nIn case you missed it, Goldman Sachs is forecasting that electric vehicle battery prices will fall dramatically in the coming months thanks to an increased supply of minerals like nickel and lithium, plus innovations in manufacturing. In a research note, the firm said it expects battery prices to drop by 40% between 2023 and 2025, resulting in \u201cbreakthrough levels\u201d of cost parity with internal combustion engine cars in some markets. By 2030, Goldman sees EVs accounting for 50% of U.S. car sales. Looking ahead, Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, said major innovations like solid-state batteries could \u201cbe a game-changer for the industry.\u201d Batteries can account for one-third of the cost of an EV.\nHere\u2019s a weird one: A California man has been charged with smuggling greenhouse gases into the U.S., Axios reported.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Amazon.com\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nGreat news for investors \u2013 Amazon.com is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $238.66, but it is currently trading at US$174 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Amazon.com\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Amazon.com. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? Since AMZN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy AMZN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Amazon.com mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward. Luckily, you can check out what analysts are forecasting by clicking here.\nIf you are no longer interested in Amazon.com, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Amazon Bets $150 Billion on Data Centers Required for AI Boom",
        "Author": "  Matt Day ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. plans to spend almost $150 billion in the coming 15 years on data centers, giving the cloud-computing giant the firepower to handle an expected explosion in demand for artificial intelligence applications and other digital services.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead\nTrump Media\u2019s Business Doesn\u2019t Matter\nTSMC Facilities to Resume Production Overnight After Quake\nTrump Got His $175 Million Bond From a Billionaire Fan\u2019s Company\nKim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War Scenarios\nThe spending spree is a show of force as the company looks to maintain its grip on the cloud services market, where it holds about twice the share of No. 2 player Microsoft Corp. Sales growth at Amazon Web Services slowed to a record low last year as business customers cut costs and delayed modernization projects. Now spending is starting to pick up again, and Amazon is keen to secure land and electricity for its power-hungry facilities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re expanding capacity quite significantly,\u201d said Kevin Miller, an AWS vice president who oversees the company\u2019s data centers. \u201cI think that just gives us the ability to get closer to customers.\u201d\nOver the past two years, according to a Bloomberg tally, Amazon has committed to spending $148 billion to build and operate data centers around the world. The company plans to expand existing server farm hubs in northern Virginia and Oregon as well as push into new precincts, including Mississippi, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.\nAmazon\u2019s planned outlay on server farms dwarfs the public commitments from Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, though neither company discloses data center-related spending as consistently as Amazon. Microsoft and Google spokespeople declined to provide comparable figures and added that each company likely includes different costs in their estimates.\nAmid broader cost-cutting at Amazon, AWS\u2019s capital expenditures on data centers shrank 2% in 2023\u2014for the first time\u2014even as Microsoft boosted its own spending by more than 50%, according to the research firm Dell\u2019Oro Group. But Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer said last month that capital expenditures would increase this year to support AWS growth, including AI-related projects.\nMuch of Amazon\u2019s data center expansion is geared toward meeting a rise in demand for corporate services like file storage and databases. But the facilities, along with advanced and expensive chips, will also provide the massive computing power required for an expected boom in generative artificial intelligence.\nMicrosoft, close partner OpenAI and Google are widely seen as leaders in commercializing software capable of generating text and insights. But Amazon is building its own tools to rival OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers. As a result, Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related revenue.\nAWS put its first server farms in Virginia, on the fringes of metropolitan Washington. Home to the first commercial interchange for web traffic, the area remains a crucial hub for video streaming and corporate and government data. Amazon later opened data centers in rural eastern Oregon, taking advantage of cheap hydroelectric power and ample tax breaks. Virginia and Oregon have since received about four of every five dollars AWS spends on US infrastructure.\nAmazon plans to spend tens of billions more in those states, but it\u2019s getting harder to secure electricity there. Data centers require lots of power, and their growing ubiquity is putting pressure on utilities. For a few months in 2022, Dominion Energy Inc., which powers Virginia\u2019s data center alley, couldn\u2019t keep up, pausing connections to facilities that were otherwise ready to come online. The utility expects demand to nearly double over the next 15 years, with the growth driven primarily by data centers.\nIn Oregon, electricity use by Amazon server farms exceeds the local utility\u2019s share of hydroelectric power, forcing it to buy electricity generated by natural gas, the Oregonian newspaper reported earlier this year.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more vetting that is occurring upfront and detailed planning that is required from the utility companies to understand how real the project is because there\u2019s so much demand out there that was not there five years ago,\u201d said Ali Greenwood, an executive director at the data center practice of Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm.\nSo Amazon is getting creative.\nIn February, the company said it would spend about $10 billion on two data center campuses in Mississippi. Billed as the largest corporate project in state history, AWS\u2019s effort will plant roots in the southern US, a region that has seen comparatively little data center spending outside of major cities like Dallas and Atlanta.\nEarlier this month, the operator of a 40-year-old nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania said AWS had agreed to spend $650 million to acquire a data center campus connected to the facility.\nIn Round Rock, Texas, AWS recently won zoning approval to build a data center and electrical substation next to a delivery depot on a slice of a former ranch the company acquired during a pandemic-era spending spree. If the project proceeds, it will be the first time the company has put such facilities on the same piece of land.\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s just a mad scramble for any place that has power any time soon,\u201d said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft manager and Seattle-based investor who tracks cloud company spending.\nEven as it ramps up, Amazon and other companies are encountering growing opposition to data centers. Much of the current animus is centered in Virginia, where residents complain about server farms\u2019 incessant hum and preservationists lament the sprawling facilities\u2019 encroachment on Civil War battlefield sites. But pockets of resistance are popping up in other parts of the US and could grow as more and more data centers come online\u2014whether they are built by Amazon or not.\nRenewable energy advocates also say the rush to build new facilities has given new life to old plants powered by planet-warming fossil fuels, and even helped make the case to build new ones. In Mississippi, for example, Amazon will pay to help the local utility to build solar farms, but the company will also operate the data centers with a new natural-gas power plant that will probably operate for decades.\n\u201cCompanies like Amazon are going to have to use their buying power to actually force the utilities to change their behavior,\u201d said Daniel Tait, research and communications manager with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog that backs renewables. \u201cNot only are they inducing more fossil fuel use, but they are creating the precedent that everybody who comes after them will do the same.\u201d\nIn recent years, Amazon has been the world\u2019s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, part of a pledge to power all of its operations with renewable electricity by 2025. But those projects can be far from its data centers, a mismatch between supply and demand that bedevils the fractured and aging US power grid.\nAmazon data center chief Miller said the company was continuing to evaluate clean energy projects beyond wind and solar farms, including battery storage and nuclear power, that can substitute for fossil fuel plants. He pledged to work with utilities and find a way to \u201cmatch our need for energy with renewable, carbon-free power.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s X Has a Porn Problem\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit\u2014With an Uncertain Future\nEV Rise Helps BYD Overtake Geely to Become China\u2019s Car King\nCanada\u2019s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil\nAI Energy Crisis Boosts Interest in Chips That Do It All\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Amazon (AMZN) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon.com is 7.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 40.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 21.1%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon.com is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.1%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.9%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Amazon.com have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.3% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon.com a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Amazon.com well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $181.42 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 17.3% since the start of the year compared to the 10.8% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 10.4% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 1, 2024, Amazon.com reported EPS of $1.01 versus consensus estimate of $0.81 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.23%.\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon.com is expected to post earnings of $4.08 per share on $641.36 billion in revenues. This represents a 40.69% change in EPS on a 11.58% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.32 per share on $715.6 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 30.38% and 11.58%, respectively.\nValuation Metrics\nAmazon.com may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nAmazon.com has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 43.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 21X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.6X versus its peer group's average of 19.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.55. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon.com currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon.com meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Amazon.com shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\nHow Does AMZN Stack Up to the Competition?\nShares of AMZN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is JD.com, Inc. (JD). JD has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of C.\nEarnings were strong last quarter. JD.com, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 15.38%, and for the current fiscal year, JD is expected to post earnings of $3.14 per share on revenue of $160.06 billion.\nShares of JD.com, Inc. have gained 12.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 8.61X and a P/CF of 5.09X.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is in the top 35% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AMZN and JD, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Amazon (AMZN): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.3% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>The ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs AMZN a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.2% over the past month to $4.08.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Exclusive: Many senior Amazon employees won\u2019t get cash raises this year",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s senior managers and other senior leaders won\u2019t receive cash pay raises this year, Fortune has learned, eliminating a key reward for top employees at the online retailing giant.\nSome of these employees may receive additional company stock, but that\u2019s not guaranteed.\nAmazon compensation staff have started notifying some leaders about the changes and explaining this year\u2019s policy.\nThe move applies to employees whose roles are classified internally as Level 6 or higher, which is more or less middle management and above. But Level 6 roles also include some individual contributors, such as senior software engineers. The compensation update applies to all employees at these levels, whether they are in office desk jobs or in managerial roles inside Amazon facilities such as fulfillment centers.\nHistorically, total compensation packages for many Amazon corporate employees consist of a larger ratio of stock compensation than at other tech companies. As such, Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan made clear in a statement the company\u2019s belief that senior Amazon employees have already benefited greatly from Amazon\u2019s share price increase of around 80% over the past 12 months.\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s compensation philosophy emphasizes ownership, which means that a portion of employee compensation includes RSUs,\u201d Callahan said in the statement to Fortune. \u201cThe more senior you are in the company, the more your compensation includes RSUs than cash base pay. Due to the growth in Amazon\u2019s stock price over the past year (approximately 77%), many employees\u2019 compensation will meaningfully exceed the amount that the company planned for them to earn when we set compensation last year and in prior years\u2019 compensation cycles. As a result, for this year\u2019s compensation cycle, we are prioritizing cash base pay increases for employees whose compensation is weighted more heavily in base pay as opposed to stock.\u201d\nTranslation: The more senior you are, the lower likelihood that you will see a cash payment. Some Level 6+ employees could still see a cash base increase if they were recently promoted or moved laterally into a completely new role. There is a chance that some employees at Level 6 or above will receive additional restricted stock units, or RSUs, this year, but that is not guaranteed. For those Level 6 and Level 7 employees who do receive new RSUs, they will vest quarterly like they do for Level 8 employees and above, rather than just twice a year.\nThe compensation update comes as Amazon leaders under CEO Andy Jassy continue to look for ways to trim unnecessary costs and increase profitability, while investing in growth areas such as generative AI. On Wednesday, Amazon announced a new $2.75 billion investment in the AI company Anthropic, adding to an earlier $1.25 billion investment in the company.\nOver the last couple of years, Amazon under CEO Andy Jassy has laid off more than 27,000 corporate employees while he focuses on investing in fewer, bigger bets. Amazon generated the largest quarterly operating profit in its history\u2014$13.2 billion\u2014in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAre you an Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\nFor momentum investors, upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook take precedent, so they'll want to zero in on the Momentum Style Score.

        "Author": "  Paolo Confino ",
        "Text": "In the months before Amazon laid off tens of thousands of workers, it also put a large number of employees on performance improvement plans, known as PIPs, according to a new report.\nThe details were uncovered in a set of documents from Amazon\u2019s HR department obtained by Business Insider. According to documents from early 2023, Amazon placed thousands of employees a month into the initial phase of its PIP process in the months leading up to multiple rounds of layoffs it conducted from November 2022 to March 2023, when the company cut a total of 27,000 employees.\nPerformance improvement plans, common at large companies, are a way to formally tell workers they need to improve, and being put on a PIP is commonly understood as a step toward termination. (When done correctly, though, PIPs can be an effective way to provide proper guidance to a struggling employee and help them keep their job.)\nIn April 2022, about six months before the layoffs started, Amazon placed less than 2,000 employees into the first phase of its PIP, which it internally calls Focus. At the end of the year, once the layoffs had commenced, upwards of 3,300 staffers a month were on such a plan. The following January the number continued to climb even higher, according to Business Insider.\nOver the same time period, the number of employees who entered into the second stage of Amazon\u2019s PIP programs, called Pivot, doubled.\nStricter performance review policies have cropped up at other large tech firms that are looking to trim their workforce\u2014either through layoffs or through other means. Firms often see performance reviews as a way to juice employee turnover at a time when employees are happy to stay put. Meta, which laid off 21,000 employees from November 2022 to May 2023, implemented stricter performance standards regarding employee bonuses. Once known for lavish stock bonuses for strong performers, Meta lowered the payout from 85% to 65% of their available bonuses for those with good, but not great, performance ratings. Meanwhile Google, which laid off about 13,000 employees over the course of last year, instructed managers to factor office attendance into performance reviews. The announcement came after Google executives pushed employees to return to the office, which was met with predictable reluctance from the rank and file.\nSome consider these changes in management policy to be an effort to push certain employees out the door without going through costly and morale-lowering layoffs\u2014a practice known as \u201cquiet firing.\u201d If companies can create conditions that make some employees leave the company, they are likely to save money on severance costs. The risks of such a strategy are that talented employees may be pushed out of the company rather than offered the necessary coaching to thrive.\nAmazon is known for having a high-performing culture with demanding standards. It has a reputation for letting go of a certain percentage of its worst performing employees every year. Within Amazon the practice is called \u201cunregretted attrition.\u201d The concept was also mentioned in the memo detailing the number of employees on PIPs, according to Business Insider, which previously reported that Amazon aims for an annual \u201cunregretted attrition\u201d rate of 6%. If the company was falling behind that goal, managers were encouraged to put \u201cunderperforming employees to Focus, [resolve] Focus entries in a timely manner, and [move] employees to Pivot if they are unable to meet the performance bar,\" according to the documents.\nIn a statement to Fortune, Amazon denied the previous layoffs were connected to its PIP process. \u201cTo conflate the two is simply wrong, because role eliminations reflect the business need for a specific type of position,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThat's unrelated to our performance management process which is in place to help individual employees who need support to meet expectations.\u201d\nAmazon added that the way it reports the metrics used to calculate the numbers of employees on PIPs changed \u201cmore than a year ago,\u201d meaning that the figures were \u201cnot reflective of accurate internal data.\u201d\nA PIP, like those issued by Amazon, in and of itself isn\u2019t a sign of \u201cquiet firing\u201d or of an effort to force workers out. The Amazon documents don\u2019t reveal how many employees successfully completed the PIP, nor how many of those on PIPs were among the people laid off in the job cuts from 2022 to early 2023. Amazon did not respond to a question about how many employees successfully completed a PIP and therefore remained at the company.\nNonetheless, PIPs can be an uncomfortable part of work, a fact Amazon seemed to acknowledge as it asked managers to identify weaker performers.\n\"In order to maintain a high and rising performance bar, we plan to refresh part of the employee population each year,\" Amazon\u2019s HR department said, according to the documents obtained by Business Insider. \"Managers, however, do not engage in performance management work eagerly. Therefore we cannot rely on good intentions and need to create accountability.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +161.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of +40.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.32 indicates a change of +30.4% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $142.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $641.36 billion and $715.6 billion estimates indicate +11.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "With 62% institutional ownership, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a favorite amongst the big guns",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Amazon.com's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership\n Insiders own 11% of Amazon.com\nIf you want to know who really controls Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 62% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amazon.com.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nAmazon.com already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Amazon.com is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Amazon.com's case, its Top Key Executive, Jeffrey Bezos, is the largest shareholder, holding 9.0% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 6.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of Amazon.com, Inc.. Insiders own US$199b worth of shares in the US$1.8t company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. \nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Amazon.com. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Amazon.com better, we need to consider many other factors.\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

        "Title": "Amazon\u2019s generative AI bot Rufus makes online shopping easier (for the most part)",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is bringing generative AI to its shopping app via its new Rufus chatbot. I\u2019ve used a good deal of generative AI apps so far, and they\u2019ve largely focused on searching the web, helping write emails, and making putting together PowerPoints a bit less, well, hellish.\nRufus, however, is designed to make shopping quicker and easier by providing you with answers to questions about product categories and individual items. The chatbot, which is trained on Amazon\u2019s product catalog and web data, appears at the bottom of the Amazon shopping app as a tab that you swipe up to access. It doesn\u2019t replace the regular search bar at the top of the screen. Rather, it serves as a means of expanding on it.\nOf course, if Rufus takes off among consumers, it will be a major win for Amazon. That\u2019s because the chatbot could get users to spend more time in Amazon\u2019s shopping app and less time looking up information about products on Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which could lead them to buy goods through competing online stores.\nI got an early look at a beta version of Rufus to see how well it works. And while it isn\u2019t perfect, it did make shopping for things like video games, cat food, and weightlifting equipment easier.\nI needed windshield wipers for my car, so I typed wipers into the search bar at the top of the screen. Rufus then appeared in a small box at the bottom of the screen with suggested follow-up questions such as \u201cWhat are the different types of windshield wipers available?\u201d, \u201cHow do I choose the right windshield wiper size for my vehicle?\u201d, and \u201cWhat are the features to look for when buying windshield wipers?\u201d\nTap a suggestion, and you\u2019ll get the appropriate answer. For instance, tapping \u201cWhat are the features to look for when buying windshield wipers?\u201d gave me a list of items to consider, including blade type, blade size, wiper rubber quality, and adapter type. Riveting stuff, I know. But if you\u2019re tired of hearing your wipers screech like nails on a chalkboard every time it rains, these are the kinds of things you want to know about.\nI also needed \u2014 well, wanted \u2014 to shop for the game \u201cFinal Fantasy VII Remake.\u201d The problem is there are a few versions of this game on the market, and deciding which one to buy can be a pain. So I decided to check with Rufus to see if it could distinguish between the versions of the game, and, to my surprise, it did just that.\nNot only did Rufus manage to tell the difference between the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 versions of the game, it also knew the differences between the base version of the game and an expanded version.\nBut here\u2019s where Rufus trips up. One of the follow-up questions it offered was \u201cWhat are the best weapons and armor to get in \u2018Final Fantasy 7 Remake?'\u201d The chatbot gave me a basic rundown of how to pick weapons and armor in the game, choose items that hit an enemy\u2019s weaknesses, etc., but it then brought up buying options for a \u201cFinal Fantasy VII\u201d character action figure and a seemingly unrelated wig.\nThe bot rebounded when I started searching for weight plates for my home gym, providing the pros and cons of metal versus rubber plates, explaining that while metal plates last longer, rubber plates will do less damage to my floor. That kind of insight can be incredibly useful for someone who\u2019s just getting into lifting and doesn\u2019t know which kind of plate to buy.\nBut when I changed up the question to \"What are differences between metal plates and rubber plates?\" it became confused and gave me a search option for metal dining plates, but a description of metal weightlifting plates.\nI also tried looking up some items I should buy for an upcoming trip to Ireland. When I asked Rufus \u201cWhat should I buy before leaving for vacation in Ireland?\u201d the bot offered an Ireland travel guide book, lightweight rain jacket, sweater, walking shoes, and a power adapter. Rufus provided an explanation for each suggestion, as well, saying that Ireland\u2019s climate can be rainy, and that even in the summer, evening temperatures can be rather cool.\nWhen I tapped on a suggested follow-up question asking about the top attractions and destinations in Ireland, Rufus gave me information about certain areas including the Cliffs of Moher and Giant\u2019s Causeway. The app then provided information about each locale, complete with books or movies for purchase related to the areas.\nFinally, I tried asking Rufus for the cheapest paper towels. But rather than a straight-up answer pointing me to the least expensive product, the bot gave me a list of popular paper towel brands and a short description of them. Not exactly what I was hoping for.\nWhile Rufus isn\u2019t quite perfect, I did find the AI chatbot helpful with certain purchasing decisions. No, it couldn\u2019t answer all of my questions, but Amazon is careful to label the bot as a piece of beta software. There are also thumbs up and thumbs down buttons you can choose to select to rate Rufus\u2019s responses.\nMore generally, I find apps like Rufus to be the most useful early application of generative AI technology. Sure, drafting emails or searching the web is helpful, but a bot that can break down the difference between a handful of products quickly and make purchasing decisions easier is far more interesting.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Here\u2019s what they said.\nSponsored: Owe the IRS $10K or more? Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the middle of the week tends to be the best time to shop if you\u2019re looking for lower prices or more deals.\n\u201cFrom my experience, Tuesday and Wednesday are often the best days to shop on Amazon. This observation comes from data analysis where we\u2019ve seen a noticeable dip in prices mid-week as sellers compete for shoppers\u2019 attention during what\u2019s typically a lull in shopping activity,\u201d said Joe Amaral, e-commerce expert and the founder of Anthem Software.\nIt all depends on the brand and what you\u2019re shopping for, though. Some brands won\u2019t have as many discounts or promotions on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.\nCheck Out: 14 Best New Aldi Products That Are Worth Every Penny\nWith fewer people shopping early in the week, Mondays could also be a good time to shop on Amazon.\n\u201cOur data indicates that early in the week, particularly Mondays and Tuesdays, offer some of the best opportunities for bargains,\u201d said Steve Pogson, an e-commerce growth specialist and founder of First Pier. \u201cThis pattern seems to emerge as sellers adjust their pricing following weekend shopper habits and in anticipation of increased midweek competition.\u201d\nThursday through Monday tend to be when most people shop on Amazon for personal needs.\n\u201cWe see shopping tends to be higher starting late Thursday evening to late Monday evening. Depending on the category, we see an increase of about 14% in sales from late Thursday to late Monday compared to Tuesday to Thursday,\u201d said Krishna Vemulapali, co-founder and chief product officer of Trellis, an e-commerce merchandising software.\nBut even with online shopping, weekends are often the worst time to shop. This is because more people tend to shop during this time and some retailers raise their prices in response to this increased demand. There may also be fewer discounts.\n\u201cWeekends, especially Saturdays, can often present the worst time to make purchases, as prices tend to be higher due to increased demand,\u201d Pogson said.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best times to shop on Amazon might depend more on the retailer than the day of the week. This is especially likely with smaller retailers or individual sellers.\n\u201cBecause there are so many different retailers selling on Amazon, there really is no \u2018best\u2019 or \u2018worst\u2019 day of the week to shop on Amazon. Prices are set by the individual retailer, and it\u2019s based on their own schedules rather than schedules set by Amazon specifically,\u201d said Samantha Landau, consumer expert at TopCashback.com.\nIf you\u2019re looking to score the best deals on Amazon, here are a few expert tips:\nLook for Lightning Deals. \u201cIf you\u2019re not set on buying from a specific brand, it\u2019s worth checking the \u2018Lightning Deals\u2019 offered daily to see if another brand is selling what you need for cheaper,\u201d Landau said.\nUse the \u201cSave for Later\u201d tool. \u201cMake use of Amazon\u2019s \u2018Save for Later\u2019 feature,\u201d Amaral said. You can then monitor specific items on your wish list and see when they go on sale.\nUse Amazon Prime. If you\u2019re a Prime member, use your membership to your advantage. You could get free shipping or exclusive deals on what you buy.\nCheck out Amazon Warehouse Deals. \u201cExplore Amazon Warehouse Deals for discounted items that are in good condition,\u201d Pogson said. \u201cThis is particularly useful for electronics and high-ticket items.\u201d\nWait for major sales. \u201cIf you\u2019re shopping Amazon brands, try to wait for a sale,\u201d Landau said. \u201cYou\u2019ll often see these items on sale for seasonal shopping events throughout the year, such as July\u2019s Prime Day sales and November\u2019s Black Friday sales. Wait to buy until then, if you can.\u201d\nKeep an eye out for new deals. Amazon retailers often put out promotions for big-ticket or new items. If you\u2019re in the market for something specific, like a gaming laptop, keep an eye out for the newest models.\nUse cash-back sites or price-tracking tools. Browser extensions like Trellis or CamelCamelCamel can track prices and alert you when specific items are on sale. Other sites, like TopCashback, can earn you money in cash back whenever you shop for eligible items.\nRead the reviews. Customer reviews aren\u2019t always reliable, but they can give you an overview of whether something you\u2019re interested in is worth the money. \u201cIf an item has no reviews, use caution and look for other options that have reviews,\u201d Landau said. \u201cReviewers will tell you about an item\u2019s quality, value for money, shipping speed and any other red flags that might be noteworthy in your decision to purchase.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Home Items To Avoid Buying in 2024\nHow To Retire on $2,000 a Month: A Frugal Living Guide\nOne Simple Way to Earn More on Your Savings in 2024\nThe Biggest Mistake People Make With Their Tax Refund -- And How to Avoid It\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The Best Day of the Week To Shop on Amazon\n"

        "Author": "  Matt Day and Rachel Metz ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. says it\u2019s investing an additional $2.75 billion in Anthropic, completing a deal it made last year to back the artificial intelligence startup and expand a partnership between the companies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead\nTrump Media\u2019s Business Doesn\u2019t Matter\nTrump Got His $175 Million Bond From a Billionaire Fan\u2019s Company\nTSMC Halts Some Chipmaking as Taiwan Gauges Quake Fallout\nKim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War Scenarios\nThe infusion brings Amazon\u2019s total investment in Anthropic, a well-regarded builder of AI tools able to generate text and analysis, to $4 billion, following an earlier investment announced in September. As part of that deal, Amazon had the right to contribute the additional funds in the form of a convertible note, provided it did so before the end of March.\nAs part of the tie-up, Anthropic has also agreed to use Amazon Web Services data centers to power some of its operations, and to use Amazon\u2019s custom-built computer chips. Anthropic, based in San Francisco, has also committed to using chips from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, another close partner.\nAnthropic is tied up with multiple big tech companies, including Google, which joined a $450 million round of financing last May led by Spark Capital. Google and Amazon Web Services are both Anthropic\u2019s cloud computing partners.\nAnthropic was formed in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, including Daniela Amodei and her brother Dario, who serves as its chief executive officer.

Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.\nGarrett Smith, financial advisor, CCO and business partner at Ascend Investment Partners, explained the many factors that can make someone spend too much on Amazon, besides its convenience, extensive assortment of products and fast delivery options.\n\u201cAdditionally, Amazon utilizes advanced recommendation algorithms to tailor the purchasing experience for individual users by analyzing their browsing history and previous purchases,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis encourages customers to explore and purchase additional products. Amazon\u2019s appeal is further enhanced by its competitive pricing, frequent offers and discounts and diverse payment options.

Racking up a credit balance you can\u2019t pay or draining your bank account of critical funds can make you feel like you are losing control of your finances.\nOne way to avoid spending beyond your budget on Amazon is to delete the app from your phone and remove your payment details from your account \u2014 make it harder for yourself to buy things, and remind yourself what your savings goals are if you\u2019re still tempted to spend.\nIf you find yourself adding items to your Amazon cart that you don\u2019t have a particular need for and don\u2019t give much thought to, you are spending impulsively. Repeated impulsive spending sprees signal that you\u2019re spending too much on Amazon, according to Smith.\nOne way to reduce your impulse purchases is to implement a waiting period. Instead of placing your order immediately, leave your purchases in your cart overnight and reconsider in the morning. You may find that they don\u2019t seem so important or tempting anymore.\nIf you have any regretful feelings or anxiety about the amount of money you\u2019re spending on items from Amazon \u2014 either right after purchasing or at some point after you\u2019ve received your items \u2014 that\u2019s a key sign you\u2019re spending too much, Smith said.\nThis is a complex issue, and the reason for your buyer\u2019s remorse will be your own, but consider why you wanted the items to begin with \u2014 and the next time you\u2019re tempted by a purchase, stop to think about the \u201cwhy\u201d before you place the order. If the items in your cart are things you just want, rather than things you really need, put off the purchase and think it over to avoid that regret.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nI'm a Shopping Expert: 9 Items I'd Never Put in My Grocery Cart\n5 Used Cars You Shouldn't Buy\nAvoid This Simple Banking Mistake That Could Cost You Over $1,000\n6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 3 Key Signs You Spend Too Much Money on Amazon Purchases\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) closed at $178.22 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.83% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.8% gain on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.23%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.14%.\nHeading into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 10.97% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.63% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.2% in that time.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Amazon in its forthcoming earnings report. On that day, Amazon is projected to report earnings of $0.81 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 161.29%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $142.39 billion, indicating a 11.8% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.06 per share and revenue of $641.11 billion. These totals would mark changes of +40% and +11.54%, respectively, from last year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Amazon. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 10.81% higher. Amazon is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Amazon is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 43.5. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 17.58.\nWe can also see that AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.55. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Commerce industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.57 as trading concluded yesterday.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 145, putting it in the bottom 43% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Lyle Daly, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "\nIf you like to shop on Amazon, you're probably either already a Prime member or considering it. Joining can certainly be a smart personal finance move. For $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, you get free one- and two-day shipping. Some orders even qualify for free same-day delivery.\nGetting Amazon orders fast and for free is always nice. Amazon Prime also includes plenty of other benefits, including its Prime Video streaming service, Amazon Music for free songs, and Prime Gaming for free games.\nThe biggest downside of Amazon Prime is that it's on the expensive side, so you should only get it if you're going to use it regularly. But there are also drawbacks that don't get talked about as much. They're worth knowing about if you're a Prime member or thinking about signing up.\nPrime members spend much more on Amazon. The average American spends $91.75 at Amazon per month, according to a survey by Upgraded Points. Prime members spend an average of $110 per month, compared to just $38 by non-members.\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing. When you're paying for Amazon Prime, it makes sense to do as much of your online shopping as possible on Amazon. You can take advantage of free shipping and fast delivery times.\nBut fast and free shipping also makes impulse shopping much easier. When you need to pay $4.95 for shipping and wait several days to get your order, you might think harder about whether you really need it. When you can get it delivered for free, and Amazon even says you could have it today if you buy within 30 minutes, it's more tempting to just buy it.\nYou don't get access to all Amazon's services with a Prime membership. Some of them have their own separate memberships that you can buy with or without being a Prime member.\nFor example, if you like audiobooks, you may be interested in an Audible membership. There are a few options, with prices starting at $7.95 per month for unlimited listening to the Audible Plus catalog. If you want to sign up for Kindle Unlimited, that's $11.99 per month.\nAmazon Prime doesn't get you a discount on either of those memberships, and they can make your monthly Amazon bill much more expensive. For those memberships in particular, consider getting a library card instead. Many libraries offer large ebook and audiobook catalogs that you can access online. I've saved thousands of dollars on ebooks and audiobooks thanks to my library card.\nAmazon Prime is most useful if you live in a big city. Some of its services are only available in major metropolitan areas. For example, Amazon offers same-day grocery deliveries through Amazon Fresh. It's a benefit that I loved using while I lived in Los Angeles. But it's not available in most of the country yet.\nSame-day delivery is another example. It's available in more than 90 cities. While many Prime members can take advantage of this benefit, you might not if you live in a mid-sized city or a rural area. A Prime membership can still be worth it in that situation. Just make sure you won't be missing out on any benefits you consider must-haves.\nWith all its benefits, Amazon Prime can easily pay for itself. I've been a member for over a decade at this point, and I love the convenience of it. Still, it helps to know about the good and the bad before you sign up.\nThis credit card is not just good \u2013 it\u2019s so exceptional that our experts use it personally.

        "Title": "Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Returns On Capital Not Reflecting Well On The Business",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.10 = US$37b \u00f7 (US$528b - US$165b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\nSo, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 10%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 12%.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Amazon.com .\nWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Amazon.com, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 13% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\nOn a side note, Amazon.com has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 31% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.\nWhile returns have fallen for Amazon.com in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 101% to shareholders in the last five years. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.\nWhile Amazon.com doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

Lilly will be able to address the increasing customer demand for its medicines seamlessly on the back of Amazon\u2019s ultrafast delivery speed.Then again, Amazon Pharmacy will be able to expand its reach to patients, which, in turn, will benefit its online retail business \u2014 the key growth driver for Amazon.AMZN has gained 86% over a year, outperforming the industry\u2019s rally of 55.8%.In fourth-quarter 2023, the company\u2019s online store sales came in at $70.54 billion, up 9% year over year.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nAmazon remains well-poised to capitalize on the growth prospects in the online pharmacy market on the back of its aggressive efforts.Per a report from Statista, the market is expected to generate revenues of $52.51 billion in 2024. The figure is expected to hit $81.37 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 11.6% between 2024 and 2028.Amazon Pharmacy, which is considered to be the first of its kind, is accessible via the Amazon app. It allows customers to place their medicine orders with the help of a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider.It offers door-to-door delivery of the ordered medicines, along with free two-day delivery to Prime members.Additionally, customers are allowed to upload their insurance information securely on their pharmacy profile on the Amazon app and opt for the payment mode before checking out.The company\u2019s introduction of RxPass, a Prime membership benefit, is another plus. It enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible medications for one flat monthly fee of $5 and get them delivered for free.The company recently launched the drone delivery of medicines from Amazon Pharmacy, which is a major positive. Amazon Pharmacy promises to drop a package within 60 minutes of order placement.All these efforts will not only aid its online store sales but also will drive growth in its subscription revenues, thanks to pharmacy related Prime perks. This, in turn, will likely drive Amazon\u2019s overall top-line growth.For first-quarter 2024, Amazon expects net sales between $138 billion and $143.5 billion.

The company\u2019s growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues.Consumer spending on T&E, which carries higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.However, with higher utilization of the firm\u2019s cards, expenses in the form of card member services and card maember rewards are likely to go up and strain its margins. Its current debt level amid a high-interest rate environment induces a rise in interest expenses. AmEx seems overvalued at the current price/earnings level. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here >>>)Shares of Philip Morris have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past year (+3.1% vs. -0.2%). The company has demonstrated impressive resilience amid rising costs due to its smoke-free strength. The company has been gaining from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is likely to remain a driver.The consistent success of IQOS and the impressive growth of ZYN have further solidified the company\u2019s position, keeping it well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2030. For 2024, management expects net revenues to increase 6.5-8% on an organic basis.However, growth-oriented investments, especially in IQOS ILUMA, may impact profits. Also, management expects the increased cost of leaf and wages to linger into 2024 before easing thereafter. Apart from this, Philip Morris has been witnessing soft cigarette volumes, which declined 1.4% in 2023.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NIKE, Inc.

        "Title": "Will Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Amazon (AMZN), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\nThis online retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 35.62%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Amazon was expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, but it reported $1.01 per share instead, representing a surprise of 24.69%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.58 per share, while it actually produced $0.85 per share, a surprise of 46.55%.\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Amazon lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nAmazon currently has an Earnings ESP of +8.64%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Why Amazon\u2019s multi-billion dollar AI alliance with Anthropic isn\u2019t the game-changer it needs to remain king of the cloud",
        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "When Amazon announced Wednesday that it had showered the hot AI startup Anthropic with an additional $2.75 billion to complete the $4 billion investment it had announced last fall, the company positioned the news as a royal win.\nAmazon's AWS, the king of cloud computing (with nearly a third of global market share), was deepening its partnership with Anthropic, the number two prince (Harry, not William) of generative AI foundation models. Under the pact, Anthropic will use AWS as its \u201cprimary cloud provider for mission critical workloads,\u201d and train and deploy its future AI models on Amazon's homegrown chips, while AWS customers get access to future generations of Anthropic's AI technology.\nLook more closely however, and the deal seems less like a sign of Amazon perpetuating its cloud dominance into the Gen AI era, and more like a hint at how vulnerable the company has become in a shifting landscape.\nAmazon, considered a laggard in the race to deploy generative AI technology,\u00a0really\u00a0needs Anthropic's highly-touted models, including the most recent Claude 3. At the same time though, Amazon is hitching its cart to an AI startup that, while boasting impressive technology, will not instantly distinguish or differentiate Amazon from the competition \u2014 since Google is also an Anthropic partner.\nPairing up with Anthropic is a necessary and beneficial move for Amazon. But with the AWS empire under siege, the question is whether the deal is too little too late.\nAWS continues to be the reigning champion of the cloud business, with 31% global market share in 2023\u2019s fourth quarter. But the race is getting tighter. Microsoft Azure, AWS's biggest cloud competitor, has edged closer with 24%, while Google Cloud has 11%. Both Microsoft and Google have seen cloud growth thanks to their Gen AI offerings \u2014 the former with its powerhouse partnership with OpenAI, and the latter with its Bard and Gemini AI momentum.\nAccording to Forrester principal analyst Tracy Woo, Amazon\u2019s Gen AI efforts have not been very impressive. \u201cIt took three, four months [for Amazon] to come up with any sort of generative AI-specific announcements [in 2023],\u201d Woo told Fortune, adding that the results were \u201creally lackluster.\u201d\nThe announcements at Amazon's Re:invent conference in December 2023 \u2014 including Amazon Q, a generative AI work assistant, and next generation AWS-designed chips \u2014 should have been a \u201cresounding response to show that you\u2019re firmly back as the number one cloud provider that everyone looks to,\" Woo said. Instead, it was \u201cunderwhelming\" \u2014 especially given the competition with Microsoft, and its alliance with OpenAI.\nAmazon announced the equivalent of a shiny engine, wheel and pane of glass for the windows, while Microsoft \u201ccame out with a Rolls Royce\u201d \u2014 marketing its Copilot offering for Azure and OpenAI models like a car that \u201cflies, it goes in the water, it is incredible.\u201d\nMicrosoft's bread-and-butter has always been software packages and solutions that slot perfectly into the enterprise workflow, so it's not surprising that the company made such a strong showing.\u00a0 But Amazon's underwhelming announcements underscored how mismatched the cloud competitors remain when it comes to the software side of things.\nThe AWS strong suit has always been infrastructure. And leveraging that skillset to differentiate is one way Amazon could try to get an edge. But there's danger there too, thanks to the rise of Nvidia, whose GPUs rule the roost, and are only getting better with Blackwell, the new Nvidia AI chip announced at its GTC conference.\nWhile it\u2019s possible for Amazon to pull off an infrastructure cloud play, said Woo, the company\u00a0 would have to \u201cdo things differently.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone builds on CUDA,\u201d she said. \u201cSo to ask everyone to rearrange their software architecture so they can cater to these AI-based TPUs that AWS has come up with is a huge ask.\u201d\nAt this point, AWS is arguably behind in both AI infrastructure and AI software, but no one should count out the cloud king, Woo emphasized. While Amazon \u201cmissed the boat\u201d on recognizing that the cloud race was no longer at the infrastructure \u2014 but had moved up the stack to AI-powered software solutions \u2014 she added that with AWS, \u201canything is possible.\u201d\n\u201cI see this as a little bit of a desperation call from [Amazon CEO Andy] Jassy responding to his shareholders,\u201d she said. \u201c[AWS CEO] Adam Selipsky\u2026really understands the market and so I have a lot of confidence that he can steer the ship in the right direction.\u201d Of course, Amazon has never been identified as the AI cloud king \u2014 \u201cso they have a huge uphill battle ahead of them,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I think they are resilient. They are an aggressive company that moves aggressively \u2014 they are not fat and happy.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), extends its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with generative AI technology.NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform, which was introduced at GTC 2024, will be available on AWS. Notably, the platform features GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink.This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.AWS strives to enable customers to explore new generative AI capabilities by delivering secured and advanced infrastructure, software and services. In this regard, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs.Apart from this, AWS intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU. These EC2 instances will feature the new B100 GPUs, which will be deployed in EC2 UltraClusters to accelerate generative AI training and inference.In addition, Blackwell will be integrated with AWS Nitro System, Elastic Fabric Adapter encryption and AWS Key Management Service. This will help in providing end-to-end control of the training data and model weights.Also, Amazon SageMaker will be integrated with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices as part of this collaboration to aid the price performance optimization of foundation models running on GPUs.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nThe latest move bodes well for Amazon\u2019s concerted efforts to expand the AWS portfolio, which has been driving its cloud customer momentum. Moreover, AWS's strength has been acting as a key catalyst behind Amazon\u2019s growth. AMZN shares have returned 74.9% over a year.We believe that AWS\u2019s solid customer base, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google.Amazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of total sales) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.Microsoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the solid adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. The Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year. Microsoft is also making strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI.Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market, and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues) in fourth-quarter 2023, up 25.7% year over year.\nThe extended collaboration with NVIDIA is in sync with Amazon\u2019s growing efforts toward bolstering its generative AI.AWS\u2019s announcement regarding the general availability of its fully managed service called Amazon Bedrock, which provides seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API, remains noteworthy.The company also made the Amazon Titan Embeddings model generally available. It added Meta\u2019s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model, which will be available through API.AWS offers a new capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to offer generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.Growing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.Per an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market\u2019s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.Amazon\u2019s solidifying prospects in this promising market are likely to instill investor optimism in the stock.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Eli Lilly Partners With Amazon's Pharmacy Business: Here's Why Both Stocks Should Win From the Deal",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's an old saying that \"politics makes strange bedfellows.\" We could add that business sometimes does too.\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and e-commerce/cloud services leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) might not seem to have much in common. However, the two companies will work together going forward in an important way. And both Lilly and Amazon stocks could benefit from the partnership.\nLilly announced on Wednesday that it will use Amazon Pharmacy to fill prescriptions for several of its drugs on its direct sales website, LillyDirect. The big drugmaker launched LillyDirect earlier this year.\nPatients who use LillyDirect don't have to go to a doctor's office. Instead, Lilly's website connects them to an independent telehealth provider or helps them find a nearby healthcare professional if they prefer an in-person visit. LillyDirect also allows online pharmacies to obtain obesity, migraine, and diabetes prescription medications directly from Lilly and send them to patients' homes.\nAmazon entered the online pharmacy business in November 2020. Amazon Prime members can receive free deliveries within two days for many prescription drugs. Customers who don't subscribe to Amazon Prime receive free shipping within four to five days. They can also upgrade to two-day shipping for a small fee.\nLillyDirect already works with Truepill to fill its online prescriptions. Amazon Pharmacy is the second online pharmacy to join forces with Lilly. The partnership makes sense for both big companies.\nLilly gains another alternative for filling patient prescriptions on LillyDirect. Bringing Amazon Pharmacy on board could attract more patients to LillyDirect. Amazon is exploring ways to deliver prescription drugs even more quickly than in two days. Lilly could benefit from those efforts.\nAmazon Pharmacy will now deliver several of the most popular prescription medications on the market. The demand continues to skyrocket for Lilly's weight-loss drug Zepbound. Amazon Pharmacy will also deliver Lilly's migraine drug Emgality and diabetes products including Basaglar, Humalog, and Humulin.\nThe partnership with Lilly -- the biggest drugmaker in the world based on market cap -- could pave the way for Amazon Pharmacy to work directly with others in the industry. Amazon Pharmacy vice president John Love told CNBC that his company's rapid delivery \"makes us an attractive partner and collaborator for all sorts of folks like Lilly, payers, providers, who are looking for a different type of pharmacy.\"\nLilly and Amazon saw their share prices rise slightly on the day their deal was announced, while the S&P 500 slipped a little. It's uncertain whether or not the news provided a small catalyst. However, both stocks should benefit over the long term as a result of the partnership.\nLillyDirect could expand the market for Lilly's prescription drugs. Working with Amazon Pharmacy should increase the number of patients using LillyDirect. Meanwhile, Amazon has made a big bet with its move into healthcare. Lilly's selection of Amazon Pharmacy is another key step that should help that bet pay off. Of course, Lilly and Amazon stocks were big winners before the companies teamed up and would have likely continued to deliver exceptional gains even without their partnership.\nZepbound isn't Lilly's only big growth driver. Sales for the company's type 2 diabetes drugs Mounjaro and Jardiance and cancer drugs Verzenio and Tyvyt are soaring. Lilly hopes to soon win U.S. regulatory approval for Alzheimer's disease drug donanemab, which could become another blockbuster in its lineup.\nAmazon's cloud services platform will almost certainly continue to enjoy a strong tailwind from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). The company has also made solid progress in boosting its profitability and free cash flow.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

The average 12-month price target is $208.48, nearly identical to the forecast for Tesla. But in the case of Amazon\u2019s stock, that projection only amounts to a potential gain of just under 20%.\nIn spite of its recent runup, Amazon still has a lot going for it. In addition to being the absolute go-to for online shopping of all types, Amazon actually generates a lot of its income from its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services. AWS already controls roughly one-third of the entire world\u2019s cloud computing service revenue, and that looks likely to expand. The company is also expanding into digital advertising, which could prove to be another generous revenue stream. Amazon recently joined the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, solidifying its position as one of the market\u2019s 30 leading stocks.\nFor some investors, however, Amazon becoming a member of the Dow suggests that its growth years are behind it, and that it is transforming into \u2014 or has already become \u2014 a slow-growing blue-chip stock. With a price-earnings ratio north of 60x and future growth not as stellar as in its infancy, there could be some valuation risk in the stock, especially after an 80% gain over the past year.\nTesla\u2019s transformation of the EV industry has been nothing short of miraculous, but now the company has to deal with something new \u2014 competition. A victim of its own success, nearly every car maker in the world is now jumping into the field, giving consumers more choice. In the meantime, EV sales themselves have been slowing, and Tesla\u2019s own price cuts are trimming the company\u2019s margins. According to analysts, the news is almost entirely bad around Tesla, from decelerating sales to a potential Q1 delivery miss, slashed earnings estimates and deteriorating margins.\nOn the plus side, many legendary investors believe that the best time to buy a stock is when people are abandoning it. Warren Buffett himself is famous for his quote that you should be \u201cgreedy when others are fearful.\u201d While Buffett hasn\u2019t issued an opinion on Tesla\u2019s stock, the philosophy could be sound. In 2025, for example, Tesla intends to release a $25,000, next-generation electric vehicle, and if it\u2019s a hit, all could be well with Tesla once again. If that all pans out, investors may lament not picking up shares at current prices.\nBased on all of the above, it seems as if Amazon has the edge going forward. The company has posted more reliable results and it has its finger in a number of different growing industries. Tesla, on the other hand, remains something of a wild card. While currently the undisputed leader in electric vehicles, it\u2019s encountering headwinds it has never faced before. A bet on Tesla stock from here is a wager that Musk can navigate the next phase in EV development and reassert the company\u2019s dominance in the industry. That makes Tesla a much higher risk/reward play \u2014 but that is exactly what certain types of investors prefer.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nFrugal People Love the 6 to 1 Grocery Shopping Method: Here's Why It Works\n6 Cities Where Social Security Goes the Farthest for Retirees\nThe 6 Smartest Things to Do With Your Tax Refund\n7 Ways Fraudsters Are Trying to Scam People in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Amazon vs. Tesla: Which Stock Is the Better Buy for the Long Term?\n"

        "Title": "Jeff Bezos Sold $8.5 Billion Worth Of Amazon Stock And Saved $600 Million In Taxes By Moving To Florida, But He's Holding Onto This Asset For The Long-Haul\u2014 And It's Something Anyone Can Buy",
        "Author": "  Jeannine Mancini ",
        "Text": "Jeff Bezos, the mastermind behind Amazon.com Inc., has been making headlines not just for his fluctuating position as one of the world\u2019s richest people but also for his strategic financial maneuvers.\nIn a move that captured widespread attention, Bezos recently sold about 50 million shares of Amazon, capitalizing on the company\u2019s significant growth since its inception. The sale, which reportedly netted Bezos around $8.5 billion, coincided with his relocation to Miami, a strategic decision that reportedly allowed him to save $600 million in taxes. This savvy financial play demonstrates Bezos\u2019s adeptness at navigating the complexities of wealth management.\nWith a keen eye on the future, Bezos has been channeling a portion of his wealth into Blue Origin, his ambitious space exploration venture. The shift in focus from e-commerce to the cosmos reflects his vision for innovation and exploration, traits that have defined his career.\nAs an expert in money and success, Bezos understands the value of diversification. One asset that maintains a significant place in his portfolio is art. While it is often seen as a luxury or a passion investment, art is increasingly recognized for its financial merits, particularly as a hedge against inflation.\nTrending:\nWith returns as high as 300%, it\u2019s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.\nOprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500.\u00a0\nTraditional investment vehicles are subject to the whims of market volatility and inflationary pressures, but fine art offers a tangible asset that appreciates over time and remains largely insulated from immediate market downturns. Bezos\u2019s interest in art, underscored by his acquisition of notable works like Ed Ruscha's \u201cHurting the Word Radio #2\u201d for $52.5 million and Kerry James Marshall's \u201cVignette 19\u201d for $18.5 million, is a testament to the growing appreciation for art as a sophisticated investment strategy.\nThe rationale behind favoring art as an investment hinges on several key factors. First, art as a physical asset is not directly tied to the financial markets, meaning it doesn\u2019t react to stock market fluctuations in the short term. This detachment provides a cushion against immediate economic shocks, offering a form of portfolio diversification that can mitigate risk.\nThe art market has historically shown a strong record of appreciation, with certain segments outperforming traditional investments over extended periods. This appreciation is driven by the unique, non-replicable nature of each piece, coupled with growing demand from a global base of collectors and investors.\nAdditionally, art possesses an intrinsic value that transcends its monetary worth. It embodies cultural significance, creative expression and historical importance, factors that contribute to its lasting appeal and enduring value. For investors like Bezos, art represents not just a financial asset but a legacy investment that can hold personal meaning while contributing to cultural preservation.\nInvestment platforms like Masterworks have democratized access to this once-exclusive market, allowing individuals to invest in shares of blue-chip art from some of the world\u2019s most renowned artists. This approach has opened the door for more investors to incorporate art into their portfolios, leveraging its potential for capital appreciation and its role as a protective hedge against inflation.\nAs Bezos\u2019s investment choices illustrate, art stands out as a strategic asset that offers not only financial returns but also enriches personal and cultural legacy. In the face of economic uncertainty, the allure of art as an investment is its combination of emotional satisfaction and financial resilience, making it an increasingly attractive option for those looking to diversify and protect their wealth over the long term.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Jeff Bezos Sold $8.5 Billion Worth Of Amazon Stock And Saved $600 Million In Taxes By Moving To Florida, But He's Holding Onto This Asset For The Long-Haul\u2014 And It's Something Anyone Can Buy originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

He also looks for stocks that have a weaker value style score. The thinking here is that value investors and growth investors are inherently looking for different things.\nAmazon AMZN is first up on the list and Brian takes a look at the most recent beat the company posted as well as the earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days. He then speaks to the rate of growth that the company is seeing noting that growth remains consistent for 2024 and 2025. Given the fact that the revenue numbers come from such a high base the consistency of growth is impressive.\nFinally Brian takes a look at the valuation metrics that most investors peak at and then looks at the chart to see if there can be any information gleaned from the trading history.\nNext up is Angi ANGI Which is a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy) just like Amazon AMZN. Brian notes that if interest rates start to move lower people that are trapped in their homes and want to purchase larger homes are likely to start to fix up their homes and complete small projects. Hiring contractors can be very difficult and this company is focused on reviews to help customers find the right company.\nAs he did with Amazon AMZN Brian takes a look at the earnings history, earnings estimate revisions, sales growth and other valuation metrics before taking a look at the chart.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Daniyal Jawaid ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will list the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence industry, go to 5 Best Alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa.\u00a0\nInternet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical objects, devices, machines, and other products that are embedded with sensors, software, and communication technologies. These devices can collect, and more importantly, exchange data with each other and central systems over the internet. They gather information to make decisions and interact with the physical world and digital systems.\u00a0\nThe IoT market is one of the fastest-growing ones globally. Growth is propelled by an increased demand for automation and an increasing need for big data for data management. Research and cloud computing platforms are also driving the growth of IoT. In addition, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also pushing the market's growth. Its market size, which was $328.6 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. The global IoT market will experience a compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.46% during this forecast period. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at 33%.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe IoT market is segmented by components, deployment, organization size, platform, technology, and industry verticals. The software segment has the largest share when segmented according to component. The cloud segment leads in the deployment segmentation, whereas the enterprise segment has the largest share when segmented according to organization size. In addition, the network communication segment has the largest market share when segmented according to technology.\u00a0\nIoT devices often rely on ML and AI to carry out their tasks. Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Echo devices are an example of IoT devices that use AI to enhance their capabilities. These devices are smart speakers that come with Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa. Recently, Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has made many AI-related enhancements to Alexa to give it a more opinionated personality. These enhancements also give it the ability to adjust tone and response to express emotions.\u00a0\nMore recently, generative AI like ChatGPT has gained the attention of tech giants like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), among others. The AI market is currently in the stage of maturation and has significant opportunities for real-world application. It has a positive long-term growth outlook, and these tech giants are looking to cash in on this opportunity.\u00a0\nThe global AI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19% during the forecast period of 2022-2023. It was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $2,575 billion by 2032. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at more than 36%. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to expand the highest during this forecast period with a CAGR of 20.3%.\u00a0\nThe AI market can be segmented according to technology, solution, and end user. Technology-wise, deep learning has the largest share. The services segment takes the lead when segmented according to the solution. When segmented according to end users, banking, financial services & insurance (BSFI) takes the lead.\n\u00a0AI's flexibility and adaptability are driving its growth. Some of the areas where it is being increasingly used are life-saving medical devices and self-driving features in electric cars. This growth is also propelled by an increasing investment from top tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) for the upgradation and development of various applications of AI. One of the supplier-side factors driving the growth of AI is the vendor and end-user industries' partnership to enhance reach. An example of such a partnership is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Intelligent Network's collaboration with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India.\u00a0\nArtificial intelligence is also causing disruption left and right. A startup founded by an ex-Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa scientist is looking to disrupt the investment industry through AI. Theia Insights recently raised $6.5 million. The company claims that it can distill vast amounts of financial information through AI and other tech so investors can make better decisions.\u00a0\u00a0\nMachine learning and deep learning-based healthcare detection systems are also emerging trends in the industry. IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s machine learning technology advances the early detection of diabetic eye disease using deep learning. IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s diabetic eye disease detection technology is found to be 86% accurate in classifying the severity of the disease across the five levels recognized on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Scale.\u00a0\nOne of the ongoing trends in AI is experimentation in advertising. AI giants such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Co-pilot, open AI's Chat GPT, and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Gemini are experimenting with ads so they could solve the monetization issue of generative AI. Most people are not willing to spend $20 every month for premium generative AI models such as GPT-4. So, ads could soon take over chatbots, which would provide these companies with a more viable revenue model. This is already been done by Adzedek which introduces itself as an AI chatbot advertising market palace. The company lets brands run sponsored ads in its custom chatbots, the revenue of which is shared between Adzedek and the chatbot creator.\u00a0\nThere is severe competition within the AI industry which also comes from new entrants. A Palo Alto-based startup by the name of Inflection AI has developed a generative chatbot that is considered as powerful as the GPT-4 model, especially across STEM subjects. This Inflection AI model is currently powering Pi, Inflection AI's voice assistant. Many people consider Pi to be ChatGPT that can take commands in the form of voice inputs.\u00a0\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa.\u00a0\nPhoto by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash\nTo curate our list of the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa, we used five (1,2,3,4,5) sources. In our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the speaker appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of speakers in our sources. So, we devised the following calculation, which we call the ranking factor: 10/ (sum of rankings*100). Our final Insider Monkey score was calculated by adding the frequency and the ranking factor. The higher this score, the higher the speaker ranks on our list.\u00a0\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\nThe Sonos IKEA Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker is 10th on our list of the best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa. It is a bookshelf speaker, which is a result of a collaboration between Sonos and Ikea. As one might expect, it is designed to blend with home decor. The speaker can be placed horizontally or vertically. Despite being a bookshelf speaker, it can also be wall-mounted. The Sonos IKEA Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker is fully integrated into the Sono's ecosystem which also means that you can use hands-free command to play music and control your speaker.\u00a0\nSonos Era 100 is 9th on our list of the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa. The speaker offers an impressive sound quality as it features a wide sound stage. It comes with angled tweeters for ultrawide sound. Apart from the usual Bluetooth and Wi-Fi audio capabilities, the Sonos Era 100 also has the option to add a 3.5mm line-in and Ethernet using an adapter. The speaker integrates seamlessly into the Sonos ecosystem.\u00a0\nThe Belkin Soundform ELite Hi-Fi is a smart speaker with a blend of functionalities and conveniences that make it a good alternative to Amazon Echo. While the speaker does not stand out in terms of aesthetics, it brings alot to the table in terms of features.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Eli Lilly & Co. is teaming up with Amazon.com Inc. to expand its nascent business of selling weight-loss drugs directly to patients.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nPutin Warns Russia Won\u2019t Stop After Predictable Election Win\nApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features\nSaudi Wealth Fund Said in Talks to Acquire National Airline\nChina\u2019s Growth Bump May Dent Urgency for More Stimulus\nSurging demand for these medications has made getting them a hassle at times. In response, the pharma giant started LillyDirect this year to make it easier. Patients connect with doctors online and certain drugs can be delivered through digital pharmacies such as Truepill and now Amazon Pharmacy.\nAmazon might be able to help speed up turnaround times for getting a prescription, said Frank Cunningham, Lilly\u2019s group vice president of global value and access. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to create a more convenient experience through our partners.\u201d\nRead More: Eli Lilly to Sell Hit Weight-Loss Drugs Directly to Public\nSo far, selling direct has been \u201csurprisingly successful,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde at the Economic Club of New York.\n\u201cDo people use it? Yes, at scale,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re having trouble keeping up.\u201d\nLilly hasn\u2019t disclosed detailed figures on its direct business, and declined to provide specifics for this story.\nAs demand for GLP-1 drugs has exploded, more patients are turning to telemedicine services to pair them with doctors who can prescribe medications. While some programs have real expertise and individualized services, others offer little beyond the scripts they dole out.\nLilly has suggested its platform could also help patients reduce their medical costs by ensuring that coupons and savings programs are applied. And unlike other pharmacies, Lilly can tell patients when medications are expected to be in stock, Ricks said. That might be a key selling point because there have been ongoing supply shortages of Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\u201cWe can communicate: \u2018OK, we don\u2019t have it today, but in two weeks time your shipment will arrive,\u2019\u201d Ricks said in the interview. \u201cCVS and Walmart can\u2019t do that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear just how many patients Amazon Pharmacy serves or how the partnership may help extend Lilly\u2019s reach. The e-commerce company said last year that its active customers had doubled, without providing a number.\nBut Amazon has had some success clinching contracts with insurers, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, which made Amazon Pharmacy its default home delivery option. It struck a similar deal with Blue Shield of California last year.\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDollar\u2019s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad\nAn Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls\nAmerica\u2019s Plumber Deficit Isn\u2019t Good for the Economy\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them\nWhen It Comes to Texas, Is Musk All Hat and No Cattle?\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.\nWhile each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.\nWhether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.\nApple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.\nBoth Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.\nBut most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.\nI find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.\nSince SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.\nConsidering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Wisconsin Supreme Court lets ruling stand that declared Amazon drivers to be employees",
        "Author": "  SCOTT BAUER ",
        "Text": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Tuesday let stand a lower court ruling that declared some delivery drivers for Amazon were employees as the state argued, not independent contractors as the online retail giant contended.\nThe court, in a unanimous decision, said the appeal was \u201cimprovidently granted,\u201d meaning the Supreme Court should not have reviewed the case. That decision dismissing the case, issued after the court heard oral arguments, leaves a 2023 Wisconsin appeals court ruling against Amazon in place.\nThat ruling found that drivers in the Amazon Flex program are a part of the state\u2019s unemployment insurance system and entitled to jobless pay if they are laid off. The decision means an Amazon subsidiary, Amazon Logistics, will likely be hit with a tax bill of more than $200,000.\nJustice Ann Walsh Bradley, in a concurring decision, said the reason the court dismissed the case was that further review \u201cwould not serve any meaningful purpose\u201d or any \u201cfurther development of the law.\u201d Justice Rebecca Bradley, in a separate writing, faulted Bradley for trying to explain the court's decision, saying it \u201cwill only sow additional confusion.\u201d\nThe case was closely watched for what effect a ruling would have on workers in the \u201cgig economy.\u201d\nAmazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said the retailer was \"disappointed that the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to weigh in and provide much needed guidance on these matters and are determining our next steps.\u201d\nLabor unions, along with the state Department of Workforce Development, pushed for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to recognize the Amazon Flex workers as employees.\nStephanie Bloomingdale, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, hailed the court's action, calling it a \u201cwin for working people.\u201d\n\u201cFar too often, especially in the emerging gig economy, big and powerful companies like Amazon use the misclassification of employees as independent contractors to deny working people essential workplace rights like minimum wages, overtime pay, and unemployment insurance,\u201d she said.\nCourts across the country have been grappling with similar questions as states struggle with how to treat workers who are hired for a particular job, often at the push of a button through a smartphone app, to deliver food, groceries, packages or perform a variety of tasks.\n\u201cThe gig economy is clogging up the court with all of this stuff, all the time,\u201d said Samantha Prince, assistant professor of law at Penn State Dickinson College of Law and an expert on worker misclassification and the gig economy. \u201cIt\u2019s just nuts. We really need this stuff to be resolved and stay resolved and stop with all the uncertainty for everybody.\u201d\nPrince said the Wisconsin case \u201cwill likely resonate through the other gig company court cases.\u201d\n\u201cThe more cases that find that gig company drivers are employees, the more companies are going to have to pay their rightful share,\" she said.\nEvery state has its own laws determining whether workers are employees or independent contractors, Prince said. Those laws set the rules for what wages and overtime the workers must be paid and, in this case, whether they are subject to unemployment benefits that the employer must contribute toward.\nEmployees who got approved for the Amazon Flex program could download an app for their personal phones showing blocks when they could deliver packages for the company. Workers would scan packages at the Amazon warehouse in Milwaukee and use their personal vehicles to deliver them, using a route suggested by Amazon.\nAfter one Amazon Flex worker was fired, he filed for unemployment insurance. The Department of Workforce Development conducted an audit of more than 1,000 Amazon Logistics drivers between 2016 and 2018 and concluded the vast majority of drivers were employees, not independent contractors, and therefore eligible for unemployment insurance payments. The state told Amazon in 2018 that it owed more than $205,000 in unemployment insurance premiums.\nThe Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission upheld the state DWD determination that the drivers were employees. Amazon Logistics sued and a Waukesha County circuit court judge ruled the drivers were independent contractors. Last year, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals overturned that ruling, agreeing with the state that the drivers were employees. That set up the appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\nMany other states have looked at the issue.\nA Virginia appeals court ruled in 2023 that Amazon Flex drivers were employees, not independent contractors, and ordered Amazon to pay unemployment insurance taxes and penalties.\nA California state appeals court last year said app-based ride-hailing and delivery companies like Uber and Lyft can continue to treat their California drivers as independent contractors, allowing them to bypass other state laws requiring worker protections and benefits.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor enacted a new rule March 11 that aims to prevent the misclassification of workers as \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d a step that could bolster both legal protections and compensation for millions in the U.S. workforce. That rule applies to wages and overtime, but not unemployment compensation.\n"

        "Text": "A unique company and stock that straddles both the tech and consumer goods sectors, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a must-own for many investors. So it's hardly an undiscovered stock, but there are more than a few pundits out there who feel it still has plenty of upside potential.\nOne is Deutsche Bank's Lee Horowitz, one of the more bullish analysts covering the company. In early March he raised his price target on the stock. Let's climb to his lofty new level to determine whether Amazon is as much of a buy as he believes.\nHorowitz added $10 per share to his Amazon fair value assessment for a new level of $210. Given that the stock trades at about $172 apiece these days, he's anticipating that it'll rise at least 22%.\nAny business that is large and well-established can have trouble growing significantly, but Horowitz said he is confident Amazon can keep cranking its numbers higher. This is \"due to the increasingly compelling operating income growth that the company is slated to deliver in the coming years.\"\nThe prognosticator singled out what he described as \"the incremental operating income contribution\" from advertising sold on its Prime Video streaming service (which recently rolled out an ad-supported tier). In his view, Prime Video could bring in anywhere from $4 billion to $6 billion worth of ad revenue both this and next year.\nIn his new analysis, Horowitz highlighted a new aspect of Amazon's business that hasn't been discussed much. By extension, Prime Video advertising probably isn't on the radar of many investors. Even if it attains only half the potential the analyst thinks it holds, the business could still bring in billions of dollars to the company every year.

        "Title": "2 Things the Smart Investors Know About Coupang, the \"Amazon of Korea\"",
        "Author": "  Lawrence Nga, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors are always looking for the next Amazon, that company which could deliver outstanding investment returns over long periods. While there will never be another Amazon, investors can occasionally find companies that have closely studied and replicated Amazon's business model in other parts of the world.\nLet's take a look at one company that has successfully implemented Amazon's playbook in Korea: Coupang (NYSE: CPNG)\nFounded in 2010, Coupang became a leading technology company in Korea with business spanning e-commerce, online grocery, food delivery, online streaming, fintech, and more. While it has diversified into other segments over the years, Coupang's core business remains in e-commerce, with around 25% market share in Korea.\nThe fundamental tenet of Coupang's e-commerce offerings is simple: low prices, fast delivery, and superior customer experience, all at once. To achieve that, Coupang has invested heavily in an integrated end-to-end infrastructure (thanks to the backing of deep-pocket investors like SoftBank) to deliver a \"wow\" experience to customers every day.\nCoupang's heavy investment went mainly into building a world-class fulfillment and delivery network. The company designed and built over 100 fulfillment centers covering 47 million square feet and housing millions of products. Up to 70% of the Korean population lives within 7 miles of a Coupang logistics center.\nWith its infrastructure in place, Coupang can offer various services to satisfy customer needs. For instance, it provides dawn delivery (delivered by 7 a.m. for orders placed up to midnight), same-day delivery, and free next-day delivery nationwide for all customers. It also offers frictionless return -- customers tap a button on the app and leave the item outside their door for pickup.\nLike Amazon's Prime membership, Coupang has a Rocket WOW membership service. Members can enjoy unlimited free shipping with no minimum spend, 30 days free unlimited returns, content streaming on Coupang Play, and more. And customers love it, which explains the rapid growth of WOW members from\u00a06 million in 2020 to 14 million in 2023 (two-thirds of its 21 million active customer base).\nIn many ways, Coupang aims to recreate (and even exceed) Amazon's experience for consumers in Korea. So far, it has been quite successful, with revenue nearly doubling from $12 billion in 2020 to $23.6 billion in 2023. And despite its success, there are good reasons to expect the future to be equally bright.\nCoupang's rapid expansion has turned it into a massive company in Korea. However, compared to the opportunity ahead, the e-commerce company has just touched the tip of the iceberg.\nFor instance, the total commerce market in Korea was $483 billion and is expected to reach $563 billion in 2027. So, while Coupang might be a whale in the e-commerce market with a 25% market share, it is at most a big fish in the ocean for the whole retail industry. Coupang's revenue of around $24 billion is less than 5% of this gigantic market.\nCoupang will continue to invest in the latest infrastructure and technology to keep its growth machine spinning, allowing it to delight its customers with ever-better services and lower prices. It is also leveraging its existing infrastructure and customer base to launch new services like food delivery, online groceries, and online streaming.\nBeyond its home turf, Coupang has recently expanded into overseas markets such as Taiwan. In the latest earnings call, the management team shared that revenue and customers in Taiwan have more than doubled over the last two quarters alone and that the market has a better growth and adoption rate than Korea.\nSuffice it to say that Coupang has enormous growth opportunities to keep it busy for many years.\nCountless companies have tried replicating Amazon's playbook in other regions or categories. So far, most have failed, and Coupang is one of the few exceptions. Better still, the company can still grow for the foreseeable future.\nStill, investing in Coupang will expose investors to other potential complexities due to the differences in culture and language, along with the distance. So, the stock is not for everyone. But for those willing to handle the downside of owning foreign companies, it's worth keeping Coupang on your radar.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coupang right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Coupang, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coupang wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been on a hot streak over the past year or so, and that trend shows little signs of slowing.\nIt isn't just average investors that are bullish on these developments. Billionaires, venture capital firms, and some of the world's biggest tech companies have AI fever -- and one start-up in particular is attracting a lot of attention.\nFigure AI is working on a humanoid robot -- dubbed Figure 01 -- that has attracted a lot of attention. It was founded by serial entrepreneur Brett Adcock, who also founded Archer Aviation -- an aerospace company working on an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.\nIn its most recent funding round, the start-up attracted financing from billionaire Jeff Bezos and Ark Investment Management's Cathie Wood, as well as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and AI wunderkind OpenAI -- the start-up that arguably kicked off the AI revolution. Figure AI raised roughly $675 million, which valued the start-up at roughly $2.6 billion.\nFigure AI developed an autonomous robot that can help alleviate labor shortages in warehouses, transportation, and retail. Just last week, Figure released a video to demonstrate its progress. It says these fields have 7 million unfilled jobs and not enough workers to fill them. Figure recently announced its first commercial agreement to supply BMW with general-purpose robots for automotive production.\nIt might be difficult for investors to invest directly in Figure AI, as the start-up is privately held, but they can invest indirectly. For example, Microsoft is among the largest investors at $95 million, so buying shares of Microsoft will get you indirect exposure to Figure AI, though a very small amount.\nHowever, there are plenty of other reasons to buy Microsoft to take part in the AI revolution.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "Wisconsin court affirms Amazon Flex drivers were not independent contractors",
        "Author": "  John Kingston ",
        "Text": "A group of Amazon drivers who are part of the company\u2019s Flex program have been affirmed by Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court to be employees rather than independent contractors.\nThe state\u2019s highest court on Wednesday declined to review an appeals court decision from last April that overturned a lower court decision.\nA court in Waukesha County had ruled in favor of Amazon (NYSE: AMZN), which argued that its Flex drivers were independent contractors under state regulations. The Court of Appeals for Wisconsin reversed that lower court ruling and held the drivers were employees under state law.\nThe Amazon Flex program hires workers (whom Amazon sees as independent contractors) to deliver small packages out of their own cars. There is no Amazon-provided vehicle, and much of the Flex \u201cfleet\u201d is made up of individual automobiles rather than delivery vans.\n\nAt the root of the case is a decision handed down by the state\u2019s Department of Workforce Development after an audit of Amazon\u2019s activities in 2016-2018. The finding by the department, and then its affirmation by the state\u2019s Labor and Industrial Review Commission (LIRC), had a practical impact of assessing Amazon slightly more than $200,000 in retroactive unemployment fees that the company had not paid for workers it believed were independent contractors.\nWhere the case fits in more broadly is that the ruling was based on how many tests of\u00a0 Wisconsin\u2019s multipart standard for determining the status of a worker, employee or independent contractor that Amazon could show it had met.\nIndependent contractor law often turns on a multipronged test that an employer will be judged on in litigation or regulation. The test determines whether a worker is truly independent or is an employee, regardless of whether the employer classifies that worker as independent.\nThe most controversial classification battle of late has been the test in the federal independent contractor law promulgated by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. There are six factors in the Biden administration\u2019s rule, many of which deal with the issue of control over a worker\u2019s activities..\n\nThe Trump administration rule it replaced was similar in structure, but the Trump rule gave particular weight to two tests: control and the ability of independent contractors to profit from the level of effort and initiative they put into the job.\nThe Biden rule has been dubbed more of a \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d rule, with all six factors \u2014 and a seventh unspecified step opening the door to a wider interpretation \u2014 carrying equal weight. As a result, it is viewed as more likely to lead the Wage and Hour Division to find a worker is an employee rather than an independent contractor.\nWisconsin independent contractor law also has a multipronged test. One of the prongs in turn has nine definitions that deal with issues such as control, ownership of equipment and whether a worker performing a task ostensibly as an independent contractor has that service on offer to others besides the company employing the worker. Those issues are familiar to any observer of other federal or state standards, including the widely used 11-point Borello test.\nThe Wisconsin regulation is also specific: To qualify as an independent contractor, a worker needs to be in compliance with six of the nine definitions.\nAccording to a summary of the case in the appellate court\u2019s decision, LIRC, after getting the case from the Department of Workforce Development, found that Amazon met only one of the tests. Amazon appealed that decision to the Waukesha County Circuit Court, which found that Amazon had met all nine tests.\nThe appellate court found several of the nine points where Amazon did meet the burden to show a worker is independent. But the court didn\u2019t find six, the magic number in Wisconsin.\nFor example, in Amazon\u2019s favor was the fact that workers could be shown to be using their own vehicles in fulfilling their duties. The court also found that the costs of operations were borne by the Flex drivers. Those were two tests where Amazon passed, supporting the argument that the Flex drivers could be defined as independent.\nBut the court also found that Amazon could not show, for example, that the Flex workers had multiple contracts or that they were actively available to offer their delivery services to anyone else, even though wording in the agreement with the drivers says they can do so.\n\nThere also is a test that the employee is performing work that does \u201cnot directly relate to the employing unit retaining the services.\u201d\nThis echoes the B prong of the ABC test from California and Massachusetts (where it is codified) and New Jersey (where it is in civil law). That prong says for a worker to be deemed an independent contractor, he or she must be offering services that are \u201coutside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business.\u201d\nIt is the B prong that has created difficulties for the California trucking industry because trucking companies often hire independent contractors to move freight, the same business the trucking company operates in.\n\u201cThe services provided by the delivery partners were integrated and interwoven into Amazon Logistics\u2019 business of quickly and efficiently shipping Amazon.com\u2019s products to Amazon.com customers,\u201d the appellate court wrote.\nThe court summed up Amazon\u2019s view that the activities of \u201cdelivery partners\u201d in the Flex program \u201c[do] not directly relate to its business because the \u2018fundamental nature\u2019 of its business is logistics, not delivery.\u201d\nAmazon said it does not offer delivery itself but rather fulfills those delivery needs through a variety of service providers, including the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx (NYSE: FDX). (The companies that deliver using Amazon-branded vehicles are almost always owned and operated by an independent company under contract to Amazon.)\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s denial of review reverts the case back to the appellate level. In that decision, the court had reversed the Waukesha County order and instructed the lower court to enter an order \u201cconsistent with this opinion confirming LIRC\u2019s order,\u201d which requires the payment of the unemployment fees.\nBut with precedents like this, findings that a worker is an employee rather than an independent contractor can set the ground for litigation regarding a wide variety of issues, including minimum wage payments and workers\u2019 compensation.\nThe Supreme Court decision to \u201cdismiss as improvidently granted\u201d the Amazon case generally comes with no comment from the court. A \u201cDIG\u201d ruling, as it is known, essentially says that while the Wisconsin Supreme Court decided to accept review of a lower case, it should not have done so and is punting the case back to the lower court.\nBut in a concurring opinion, Judge Ann Walsh Bradley criticized the court for not offering more details on its reasoning for rejecting further review of the Amazon case. \u201cWithout explanation, the court disposes of the case in a two-sentence per curiam decision, dismissing the case as improvidently granted,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSuch a dearth of explanation has been the court\u2019s pattern for the past seven years.\u201d\nThat led to a concurring opinion by Judge Rebecca Grassl Bradley, who said not commenting on the rationale for rejecting review is standard practice, all the way up to and including the U.S. Supreme Court.\nMore articles by John Kingston\nIn-state Amazon Flex driver prevails in court, can avoid arbitration\nBiden administration revising rule on independent contractors\nFurther appeals to block AB5 from California trucking seen as a long shot\nThe post Wisconsin court affirms Amazon Flex drivers were not independent contractors appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

Aiming to slash costs, the company had cut more than 27,000 jobs and trimmed stock awards last year.\nThe pay raise matter was first reported by Fortune.\n(Reporting by Mariam Sunny and Priyanka G in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n"

You also might be surprised at how much you can save on daily-use items \u2014 savings that can add up month after month. To help you see the savings potential, here are a variety of items to buy at Costco, including current price comparisons.\nSponsored: Owe the IRS $10K or more?

Costco offers a price of $44.99 for 192 packs ($0.23/pack), and its exclusive plus version only sold at Costco has better absorbency than any other Huggies diapers.\u201d\nCooper noted that \u201cthe price of the same item on Amazon is $52.76 for 198 packs ($0.27/pack), 17% higher than Costco.\u201d\nExplore More: 10 Best Member\u2019s Mark Pantry Products To Pick Up at Sam\u2019s Club\n\u201cIf you\u2019re on the go a lot, you may rely on energy drinks and buying them in bulk could save you money,\u201d said Samantha Landau, a consumer expert at TopCashback.\n\u201cAt Costco, the 18 Variety Pack of Alani Nu Energy Drink goes for $25.99,\u201d Landau continued. \u201cWhen shopping on Amazon, a similar variety pack of the Alani Nu Energy Drinks goes for $46.33. You save almost 50% when shopping at Costco for this product.\u201d\n\u201cYou can get 20 pairs of K. Bell No-Show Socks for $19.99 at Costco,\u201d said consumer analyst Julie Ramhold with DealNews. \u201cPlus, Costco\u2019s website states that you might be able to get these socks at an even lower price in your local warehouse.\u201d\n\u201cThe socks have a high rating at both Costco and Amazon,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou can find a pretty great deal at Costco which quotes $19.99 for 20 pairs ($0.99/pair). At Amazon, it costs you $16.99 for only 10 pairs ($1.7/pair), 70% higher than Costco.\u201d\n\u201cToilet paper is a daily necessity for households,\u201d said Cooper, recommending Costco to get Charmin\u2019s 2-ply, 213 sheets, 30 rolls deal.\n\u201cThis 2-ply soft toilet paper has good sales and ratings (4.5) on Amazon,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cCostco sells them for $33.49 for 6,390 sheets ($0.005 per sheet). This price is 17% lower than Amazon\u2019s price of $43.99 for 6,630 sheets ( $0.006 per sheet).\u201d\n\u201cWhile the outright savings don\u2019t seem like that much \u2014 especially if you get free shipping via a Prime membership \u2014 the price per roll works out to be much better at Costco,\u201d Ramhold said.\n\u201cGround coffee is a household staple for your morning fix or a last-minute emergency cup,\u201d Landau said. \u201cAt Costco, the Folgers Classic Roast Ground Coffee goes for $12.99. This makes up to 400 cups of coffee. When shopping at Amazon, the same size product goes for $27.99. This is over double the price of Costco\u2019s version.\u201d\nWhen you have a big family and everyone likes to drink milk, pick up this deal on Horizon Organic Whole Milk which packs an 18-count of 8-ounce bottles into your shopping cart.\n\u201cHorizon\u2019s Organic whole milk, popular on Amazon with a rating of 4.7 from 4,902 reviewers, is sold at $25.47 for 18 counts of 8 fl oz ($0.27/fl oz), 80% higher than Costco which only costs $21.99 for 18-count 8 fl oz ($0.15/fl oz),\u201d Cooper said.\n\u201cWhether you run a business or just have a full household, buying hand soap in bulk might make the most sense for you to save money,\u201d Landau said.\n\u201cAt Costco, the two-pack of the Softsoap Advanced Clean Liquid Hand Soap Refill is $12.99,\u201d Landau went on to describe. \u201cWhen looking at Amazon, a one-pack item of the same size is $17.82. When shopping at Costco, you get double the product for over $4.00 cheaper.\u201d\nYou can stock up on 170 fluid ounces of Tide Ultra Concentrated Liquid Laundry Detergent \u2014 adding up to 152 loads \u2014 for a great price when you buy at Costco.\n\u201cCompared to Amazon which costs you $31.99 to buy a Tide liquid laundry detergent for 150 fl oz ($0.21/fl oz), Costco sells the same detergent at 170 fl oz for only $29.99 ($0.17/ fl oz), 19% lower than Amazon,\u201d Cooper said.\n\u201cThis Aveeno daily moisture lotion which can moisturize your skin for 24 hours, sells very well on Amazon with a rating of 4.7 from 50,858 users,\u201d Cooper said.\nCooper continued to say, \u201cAt Costco, you can find two 24 fl oz bottles at $18.99 ($0.39/fl oz). It is lower than the same product of two 18 fl oz bottles on Amazon, priced at $20.27 ($0.56/fl oz).\u201d\n\u201cAt Costco, you can grab a package of 32 of these delightful snack cakes for $11.99 or 38 cents per cake,\u201d Ramhold said.\n\u201cHowever, if you try to shop for the same item at Amazon, you may be hard-pressed to find the exact same size product,\u201d Ramhold continued. \u201cI found two boxes of 8 cakes each (so 16 total) for $39.99, which works out to a whopping $2.50 per cake. There\u2019s no contest \u2013 Costco is the way to go here.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\nI'm a Shopping Expert: 9 Items I'd Never Put in My Grocery Cart\n5 Used Cars You Shouldn't Buy\nAvoid This Simple Banking Mistake That Could Cost You Over $1,000\n6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Items That Are Cheaper To Buy at Costco Than Amazon\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-03-04, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $62.04. It's currently trading at a price of $178.22. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -187.27%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$2.81\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.2%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n16.57\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n7.05\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n62.04\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $38.50. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -362.91%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) already made a big success after it eased concerns over being smashed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). Then it kicked off 2024 by showing its AI-powered-search engine contribution to the grocery shopping revolution with which it entered the long-dominated territory of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nRetail-centered generative AI search engine is giving Google a run for its money.\nWalmart bravely entered the field that Google has dominated since the very beginning. Although Google is not threatened directly as its search engine is used far beyond retail, Walmart\u2019s success still could inflict harm on the world's most widely used search engine. Instead of sending users to Google and other online destinations, Walmart has been using generative AI as of January to help users arrange an event, taking into account location, search history, and other contextual information. During the unveiling preview in January, Walmart also hinted at developing a generative AI-powered search feature where users would be able to ask for a themed party and receive all the relevant items as a result.\nWhat also helped Walmart is that Alphabet and Google released Gemini generative AI before it was ready at the same time. But despite acknowledging the mistake, Alphabet continues to commit significant funds and efforts to further develop Gemini along with more specialized AI tools to integrate within retail ecosystems, such as Conversational Commerce tools from Google Cloud that allows businesses to use virtual AI-powered customers service agents.\nBut the bottom line is that Walmart is only doing what everyone else is, led by titans such as Amazon. For example, Amazon users can converse with an AI shopping assistant about what they need instead of searching for specific products. It just pulled it off quickly and is using the technology wisely.\nAutomatic replenishment feature.\nMoreover, Walmart is envisioning a future where grocery shopping is done hands-free, such as a fully stocked fridge that magically replenishes itself. AI-powered InHome replenishment service aims to automate the entire grocery shopping process, based on the combination of individual consumer habits and Walmart's extensive knowledge of general shopping patterns. If successful, Walmart will be surpassing Amazon and its Subscribe-and-Save model as Amazon is yet to utilize AI for this purpose.\nWalmart took its place in the gen-AI era in the making.\nWhat should worry Google and Amazon is the speed at which Walmart employed generative AI to enhance its offerings, breaking the pattern of everyone going to Google for everything. Generative AI is democratizing opportunities that used to be unavailable and Walmart has successfully positioned itself as an innovator, worthy of being next to the titans themselves such as Google and Amazon.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Stock picking has long been thought of as an art, but the savvy investor knows that there is also plenty of science to it. And for those willing to embrace the science, TipRanks has the Smart Score, an AI-driven data sorting tool, based on sophisticated natural language algorithms.\nThe tool gathers the reams of data thrown up by the stock markets \u2013 the transactions, the stock movements, the traders\u2019 moves, all of it. The result is distilled down to a simple, easily readable score, a single number on a scale of 1 to 10, showing investors at a glance the likely trajectory for any stock. And the \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 stocks are the shares that clearly deserve closer scrutiny.\nRight now, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) are setting the pace, boasting the highest Smart Score among large-cap stocks on the \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 list. Let\u2019s see what it is about these names that makes them stand out from the pack.\nAmazon\nWe\u2019ll start with Amazon, a company that needs little introduction. This survivor of the original dot-com bubble has expanded from its origin as an online bookseller to become the world\u2019s largest online retailer, dealing in anything and everything \u2013 and in the process, also becoming the world\u2019s fourth-largest publicly traded firm, with a market cap of $1.8 trillion and approximately $1.4 billion in daily sales.\nAmazon has complemented its mega-cap size and near-endless online retail offerings with a huge brick-and-mortar infrastructure and rapid delivery guarantees. The company has a global network of warehouses and fulfillment centers, with some facilities totaling more than 1 million square feet of storage and workspace. The company can deliver customer orders around the world, and in many locations can offer next-day delivery. As an online retailer, Amazon depends on its website, which is one of the internet\u2019s most trafficked \u2013 receiving well over 2 billion site visits every month.\nThat\u2019s just Amazon\u2019s eCommerce business. eCommerce is the core of the company, but Amazon is branching out, working to diversify the products it offers to ensure that it can meet customer needs in an ever-changing world. The company has a popular cloud computing service, AWS, available by subscription, that has become an important source of revenue. In addition, Amazon offers its customers such widely varied services as online gaming for both kids and adults; home automation; TV streaming; ebooks via the Kindle reader; and even grocery deliveries \u2013 the full list of services encompasses these, and many more. The common denominator is putting online retail and subscription models to work in the real world, and in people\u2019s daily lives.\nWhat this comes down to for investors is simple: $170 billion in revenue reported in the last quarter, 4Q23. That represented a near-14% increase from the prior-year period, and was $3.74 billion better than had been anticipated. The company\u2019s bottom line, the firm\u2019s $1 EPS, was derived from a net income of $10.6 billion. AWS proved to be an important driver in the quarterly gains, generating $24.2 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year.\nFor 2023 as a whole, Amazon brought in $574.8 billion in total revenue. Net income for the year came to $30.4 billion, or $2.90 per diluted share. The company boasted a free cash flow of $36.8 billion for 2023, contrasted with a cash burn of $11.6 billion in the prior year.\nFor Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz, the key point here is Amazon\u2019s proven ability to continue generating income growth \u2013 even on top of its already fast pace. He writes of the company, \u201cDespite outperforming the market by ~60 points over the last year, Amazon remains one of our top picks in our coverage, due to the increasingly compelling operating income growth that the company is slated to deliver in the coming years\u2026 Given our constructive outlook on the shape of advertising operating income in the coming years, we raise our 24/25 OI estimates by 10/8%, respectively, and take our price target higher to $210. We continue to believe that GAAP earnings valuation for Amazon screens increasingly compelling\u2026\u201d\nThis adds up to a Buy rating, of course, and the $210 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of nearly 20%.

AMZN is selling for $175.35, and its $208.48 average target price implies a gain of almost 19% on the one-year horizon. (See AMZN stock analysis)\nAlibaba Holdings\nNext up is Alibaba, another giant of the online retail industry \u2013 and the company that some call \u2018China\u2019s Amazon.\u2019 Founded by Chinese tech entrepreneur and billionaire Jack Ma, and based in Hangzhou, the company has been in business since 1999. Alibaba started out as the main online retailer focusing on China\u2019s domestic market and is still the dominant eCommerce player in this country of 1.4 billion people. Alibaba has branched out to the global online marketplace, but China remains the core of its business.\nThat business core is solid. Alibaba boasts that it can deliver just about any product, to just about any buyer, to just about any location in China \u2013 and can guarantee next-day or 2-day delivery. On the global eCommerce scene, Alibaba lists some 200 million-plus products available, across 5,900 product categories, coming from over 200,000 suppliers with delivery to more than 200 countries and territories.\nIn addition to online retail, both in China and abroad, Alibaba, like Amazon, is branching out into other areas. The company has its hands in several pots, including cloud services and digital media. Retail, however, still makes up the bulk of the company\u2019s business; in fiscal year 2022, the company brought in 67% of its revenue from the Chinese retail sector, with another 5% from international commerce.\nIn the last reported quarter ending December 31, Alibaba posted total revenue of US$36.67 billion, marking a 5% year-over-year increase and surpassing forecasts by $270 million. The eCommerce giant\u2019s earnings, by non-GAAP measures, came to $2.67 per share, or 3 cents per share better than the estimates. The company generated $7.96 billion in free cash flow during the quarter. Despite these successes, shares in BABA are down 5% so far this year, in somewhat volatile trading over the past 2 months.\nThe fall in share price has not prevented Truist\u2019s 5-star analyst, Youssef Squali,\u00a0from coming down firmly on the bullish side for BABA stock. He sees Alibaba well positioned to move forward, and lays out four reasons why: \u201c1) compelling valuation (1x EV/Revs and 4.4x EV/AEBITDA), 2) improving order volume growth at Taobao/Tmall fueled by greater focus and investments, 3) strong FCF generation (11% FCF yield) which is fueling a capital return strategy with larger buybacks and dividends; and 4) prospects for a macro recovery as mgmt strengthens its competitive offerings for TTG, Int\u2019l and Cloud. CY24 will be an investment year for BABA which should keep margins in check near-term, that said we believe that much of it is already reflected in the current valuation.\u201d\nGoing forward from there, Squali gives BABA stock a Buy rating, and sets a $114 price target that suggests the shares will appreciate by 55% over the course of this year. (To watch Squali\u2019s track record, click here)\nAlibaba\u2019s stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 18 recent reviews that include 15 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock is currently priced at $73.55 and its $101.55 average price target implies a 38% upside potential for the next 12 months.

        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com\u2019s self-driving car unit, Zoox, is seeking to stay abreast of rival Waymo by expanding its vehicles\u2019 testing in California and Nevada to include a wider area, higher speeds and nighttime driving.\nThe changes, announced on Thursday, apply to Zoox's fleet of vehicles that it designed and built itself. Those resemble toaster ovens on wheels and lack manual controls inside, like steering wheels, pedals and gear shifters. Zoox also operates retrofitted self-driving Toyota Highlanders in Seattle, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Foster City, California.\nThe moves are modest compared with Alphabet\u2019s Waymo, which this week announced a plan to begin a taxi service in Los Angeles, on top of the existing markets of San Francisco and Phoenix, where it already ferries passengers in its retrofitted autonomous Jaguars.\nZoox said it will free up its specially designed vehicles to drive at speeds up to 45 miles per hour (72 kph), from 35 mph. It also expanded the Las Vegas area in which the cars can travel to five miles from one mile, it said in a statement. \u201cDriving in these larger areas exposes our robotaxis to the busiest conditions they\u2019ve ever encountered,\u201d the company said.\nThe Zoox vehicles will also drive in light rain and at night, the company said, critical for gathering additional data.\nLike rivals, Zoox is hoping to one day replace human drivers with full self-driving vehicles that technologists say are safer and more reliable because they do not succumb to human error. Zoox has not given a timeline for when it thinks its fully autonomous vehicles will be ubiquitous.\nRival General Motors\u2019 Cruise halted testing of its robotaxis last year after regulators alleged executives had withheld evidence from an accident in San Francisco in which a Cruise vehicle struck and dragged a woman about 20 feet (6.1 m)after she was hit by a human-driven car.\nAmazon bought Zoox in 2020 for more than $1 billion, leading to speculation it could eventually use the cars as delivery vehicles, sparing it the cost of paying for drivers. Zoox has not made any announcements about its plans beyond as robotaxis.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Sheryl Estrada ",
        "Text": "Good morning. CoreWeave is positioning itself for the generative AI boom as a top cloud provider, and the Nvidia-backed startup just added a finance chief whose experience among the sector's biggest players can help his new firm, well, compete against the sector's biggest players.\nCoreWeave, which provides cloud GPUs crucial for high-powered AI computing, announced on Tuesday that Nitin Agrawal is taking over as CFO. He previously was VP of finance for Google Cloud.\nWhy join the startup? \u201cCoreWeave is filling a void in the high-performance computing space left unaddressed by the legacy cloud providers,\u201d Agrawal told me. \u201cI think we have a unique opportunity to build the next generation of cloud infrastructure alongside the best team in the industry.\"\nAgrawal replaces Evan Meagher, who stepped down, according to the company. At Google, Agrawal said he and his team helped bring Google Cloud to profitability and developed its AI and machine-learning investment strategy. Before that, he served as CFO of Mapbox and held leadership roles at Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.\n\u201cAll of those roles have helped me learn the intricacies of operating a cloud business at scale and scaling new businesses in high-growth environments,\u201d Agrawal said.\nNew Jersey-based CoreWeave was cofounded in 2017 by current CEO Michael Intrator; Brannin McBee, the firm's chief development officer; and Brian Venturo, the chief strategy officer. It began as a crypto-mining company that used GPUs to verify blockchain transactions before pivoting to AI.\nThe startup announced in December it closed a $642 million round led by Fidelity Management & Research Co., with additional participation from Investment Management Corporation of Ontario, Jane Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Nat Friedman & Daniel Gross, Goanna Capital, Zoom Ventures and others. (That transaction values the company at $7 billion, but the firm declined to comment on that figure when asked by Fortune.)\nCoreWeave announced in August that it had secured $2.3 billion in debt financing led by Magnetar Capital and Blackstone, with participation from Coatue, DigitalBridge Credit, and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, PIMCO, and Carlyle. The company also announced in April that it had raised $221 million in Series B funding led by Magnetar Capital, with contributions from Nvidia, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, and a month later secured $200 million in a Series B extension, also led by Magnetar Capital.\nCoreWeave uses Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips for data centers, and for building out data centers for AI computing, including a cloud-native AI supercomputer.\nBut what actually separates CoreWeave's AI infrastructure from that of competitors? It supports \u201cthe most demanding workloads, using purpose-built cloud infrastructure, to perform at the highest possible level for GPU-accelerated compute workloads, rather than using commoditized infrastructure,\" Agrawal explained. \u201cThat helps it to deliver both speed and reliability.\u201d\nAs CFO, Agrawal said he's focused on sustaining profitable growth, and \"the best way to accomplish it is by keeping customer priorities at the forefront\" and \"disciplined execution.\u201d\nGiven everything he's helped build, and everything he still plans to build, I asked Agrawal to share his favorite piece of career advice. He offered two.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it's the people that matter, so make sure you take people along with you in your journey,\" he said. And you should \u201calways keep a healthy disregard for the impossible while being grounded in reality.\u201d\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nMar\u00eda Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today\u2019s newsletter.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Those products are illegal to use, sell or even advertise in the U.S. Authorities note they can prevent people from making 9-1-1 calls and security experts note thieves can use them to nullify wireless security cameras, which are popular for home security.\nEven local police forces are prohibited from using the technology.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia stock rose 239% on the back of incredible demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia is now worth more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.\u00a0Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) are also members of the $1 trillion club, and each company is working on AI in its own unique way.\nBut I think AI could soon propel Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to a $1 trillion valuation, too. It operates industry-leading AI data center infrastructure, and the company is building capacity at a record pace because it simply can't keep up with demand. As of this writing, Oracle is valued at $350 billion, so investors who buy the stock today will see roughly a 185% gain if the company joins the $1 trillion club.\nFounded in 1977, Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. It developed revolutionary database management software back then, before helping its business customers prepare for the internet age in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The company created Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 and has since delivered hundreds of digital services to those businesses to migrate their operations online.\nNow, using Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs), Oracle is focused on delivering the best data center infrastructure for AI workloads. Three months ago, Oracle told investors it was expanding 66 of its existing data center regions and building 100 more to meet demand.\nChairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology allows businesses to develop generative AI models twice as fast and for half the cost of other cloud providers. As a result, demand for its latest Gen2 Cloud capacity is skyrocketing. Oracle is able to keep costs down because its data centers rely on automation, which means there is little difference in operating costs between running 10 data centers and running 100. That also enables the company to build and scale them quickly.\nIn a conference call with investors for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), CEO Safra Catz said Oracle has at least 40 new AI bookings worth more than $1 billion each that haven't even come online yet.\u00a0In other words, they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during Q3, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%. While that sounds like a sluggish growth rate, revenue for OCI surged 49% to $1.8 billion, and revenue for Gen2 Cloud specifically (within OCI) grew by 53%.\nWhile OCI only accounts for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue right now, those growth rates will ensure it becomes a much larger piece of the pie in the near future.\nOracle's total AI bookings across its business topped a record $80 billion in Q3, marking a 29% increase from the year-ago period. As you can see, bookings grew four times faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which is evidence of the enormous demand for computing capacity the company is struggling to fill.\nAt the bottom line, Oracle's Q3 earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85, which also outpaced revenue growth. It was thanks, in part, to careful cost management, with operating expenses increasing just 4% year over year. But it was also thanks to a substantial increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side, which is a natural consequence of scale. Oracle expects continued improvement as more of its new data centers come online.\nAI is the main point of focus for Oracle at the moment, but there's another opportunity worth mentioning. The company now has two Oracle Alloy data center regions online, which organizations can use to deliver their own cloud services to their customers -- without having to manage the infrastructure.\nOracle has planned five more Alloy data center regions, meaning capacity could soon triple. It's just another example of this company's long-standing commitment to innovation.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is on track to generate $53.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending May 31), placing its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6. That falls between the valuations of other cloud giants, like Amazon (P/S ratio of 3.1) and Microsoft (P/S ratio of 13.2).\nAssuming Oracle's P/S ratio remains constant, the company would have to generate $151.5 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could get there within a decade if its revenue grows by 11% annually.\nWhile Oracle is growing more slowly on a quarterly basis right now, its revenue increased by 22% last fiscal year. Plus, Ellison believes OCI revenue will increase by more than 50% for years to come, which could drive an acceleration in the company's top line overall as the segment grows larger.\nRemember, Oracle is in the process of more than doubling its data center footprint, and its bookings just soared by 29% in a single quarter. Bookings are expected to convert into revenue eventually, implying revenue growth will likely accelerate in the near future.\nAI is the greatest financial opportunity Oracle has ever pursued, and I think it's the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "SEOUL, South Korea, March 05, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Seoul Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (\"SSC\"), a leading global innovator of LED products and technology, has announced that it filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the European Unified Patent Court against Amazon (Amazon Services Europe), the world's largest distribution company, seeking an injunction against the sale of infringing products.\nSSC and its affiliates have obtained 15 permanent injunctions for patent infringement against various manufacturers and distributors in the past five years from the U.S., Germany, France, and Netherlands courts. Filing lawsuits in individual countries, however, was a less efficient way to enforce patents against infringing products.\nThe European Unified Patent Court, which was established in June 2023, has comprehensive jurisdiction over European patent litigation. Injunction and damages orders for patent infringement from the Unified Patent Court can take effect simultaneously in 17 European countries, including Germany, France, and Italy. Consequently, SSC can now prevent the distribution of infringing products throughout Europe with a single lawsuit.\nAmong the over 18,000 patents held by SSC, the asserted patent in this lawsuit relates to a revolutionary technology that freely adjusts the brightness and color of LED lighting products over time. This solution technology is widely used in smart lighting products and color-tunable lighting. Another asserted patent relates to heat dissipation in LED packages, a crucial technology widely used in automotive lighting where heat dissipation is critical.\n\"As in life, the opportunities in the market should be as fair as possible,\" said Han-seon Park, Executive Vice President of the marketing department of SSC. \"Despite emphasis on ESG management, some large LED companies are merely distributing infringing products with little interest in respecting intellectual properties. It hurts us all, even those striving for a society built on fair competition,\" she added.\nAbout Seoul Semiconductor\nSeoul Semiconductor is the world\u2019s second-largest global LED manufacturer, a ranking excluding the captive market, and has more than 18,000 patents. Based on a differentiated product portfolio, Seoul offers a wide range of technologies, and mass produces innovative LED products for indoor and outdoor lighting, automotive, IT products, such as mobile phones, computer displays, and other applications, as well as the UV area. Seoul\u2019s world\u2019s first development and mass production products are becoming the LED industry standard and leading the global market with a package-free LED, WICOP; a high-voltage AC-driven LED, Acrich; an LED with 10X the output of a conventional LED, nPola; a cutting edge ultraviolet clean technology LED, Violeds; an all-direction light emitting technology, filament LED; a natural sun spectrum LED, SunLike; and more.

        "Text": "Kara Swisher, the author and journalist who covered technology and the early days of the Internet from San Francisco, has a new book.\nIn a recent exclusive interview with TheStreet, Swisher discussed a few predictions she has made over the years and the way she views how they turned out, both right and wrong.\nRelated: Cathie Wood buys $35 million of beaten-down tech stock\n\"Burn Book\" is Swisher's account of what publisher Simon and Schuster calls \"the inside story we've all been waiting for about modern Silicon Valley and the biggest boom in wealth creation in the history of the world.\"\nSara Silverstein, TheStreet's Editor-In-Chief, asked Swisher about her new book. \"In a lot of it you talk about a lot of the predictions you made in tech that have been right over and over again. Which of those are you most proud of, that was most shocking to the industry, that you were right about?\"\nAmanda Stronza/Getty Images\nSwisher began by looking about 25 years into the past, recalling what it was like trying to guess how the new technology would progress and affect other industries.\n\"A lot of them, I don't remember because we had a lot of scoops and things like that,\" Swisher said. \"But I think one thing is the very basic fact that everything that can be digitized would be digitized.\"\n\"I think it's kind of an obvious thing,\" she continued. \"But 25 years ago ... the idea that every industry would be changed by what was happening in tech.\"\nTo take a more recent instance, Swisher discussed a prediction she made about how social media might fuel former President Donald Trump's ability to communicate with his supporters \u2014 and what the repercussions of that fact might become.\n\"I think more recently when I wrote that column in the New York Times, sort of predicting the insurrection and how ... I talked about the lies Donald Trump would tell,\" Swisher said. \"It would shoot up and down the ecosystem, the digital ecosystem of the right.\"\n\"And then he'd ask them to do something to stop the election,\" she added. \"And when I did it, I got a lot of pushback from social media sites because I said, I called them handmaidens to sedition, essentially. And I think I felt good about being right about that, though I felt I wish I was wrong, I guess.\"\nShutterstock/TheStreet\nSilverstein asked Swisher about predictions she had been wrong about.\n\"You know, at first, when eBay\u00a0 (EBAY) , when they visited me and I went to look at what they were doing, I thought it was a stupid idea,\" Swisher said. \"I just was like, I don't get this. I don't get it at all. And I think I was wrong about that.\"\n\"And now, look, eBay is not doing as well, but the idea was a great one, the idea of marketplaces,\" Swisher said. \"And for some reason in that case, I couldn't wrap my head around it.\"\nSwisher added another important marketplaces business she didn't support initially.\n\"I was not a supporter of Amazon\u00a0 (AMZN) , but I thought they would do a lot better than most of the press thought at the time when they called them Amazon-dot-bomb,\" Swisher said. \"I thought Jeff Bezos was a great entrepreneur and directionally it was correct.\"\n\"Others, you know, Webvan, so many others failed,\" she added. \"But I did believe in commerce after that. But marketplace was something I missed.\"\nSwisher also discussed some early valuations that didn't make sense to her, including what happened after the 2007 Facebook\u00a0 (META) \u00a0announcement that it would receive a $240 million investment from Microsoft\u00a0 (MSFT) .\n\"When Facebook got a $15 billion valuation after the Microsoft investment, I was gobsmacked and I thought it was stupid and I said so,\" she recalled. \"And I was wrong because what they did is they grew into it. They sort of faked it till they made it kind of thing. And I just didn't think that the market would sustain these crazy valuations. But I should have known because they did it before.\"\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n"

        "Author": " Sarah Fielding    ",
        "Text": "Since Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X) in October 2022, he has thrown a lot of things at the wall and hoped they stuck (read: make money). Now, he's taking a page from YouTube and launching a video streaming service on the platform, SamMobile reports. Musk announced that the feature was \"Coming soon\" in a quote tweet from the DogeDesigner's account: \"You can soon watch your favorite X long form videos directly on your SmartTVs.\"\nX will launch a dedicated app that allows users to watch these videos on Samsung TV and Amazon's Fire TV. Musk recently said X would be a \"video-first\" platform moving forward, and this development shows that this will translate beyond the small content boxes typically available on feeds to a bigger screen. At the time, Musk also claims that eight out of ten times a person visits X, they're watching videos.\nThe decision follows bad news for X, with a recent Edison Research report finding that 2024 has seen a 30 percent drop in the site's usage compared to 2023. In X's continued bid to change (and remain popular), it has been leaning into resources for creators and its dwindling advertisers. One such shift came in a February announcement that the platform would roll out tools so that \"advertisers on X can run ads against a curated list of premium content creators\" \u2014 including pre-roll video ads, Forbes reported. As for longer videos, we'll have to wait until they roll out on Samsung and Fire TVs to see how effectively they grab users' attention.\n"
