        "Text": "Amazon is a Seattle-based retailer and technology company primarily involved in e-commerce, cloud computing (Amazon Web Services), digital streaming and artificial intelligence. It owns dozens of diversified subsidiary companies, with large investments in others. Amazon\u2019s stock is listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol $AMZN and is part of the S&P 500 index.\nHere's what you should know about how Amazon became one of the largest companies in the world.\nThere\u2019s alpha in information. Sign up for the Market Minute newsletter to get summaries of stock market and economic news delivered right to your inbox.\nAmazon was launched out of the garage of founder Jeff Bezos in 1994. The company began operations in April, 1995 when, early on, Bezos famously hand-delivered orders to the post office.\u00a0Originally called \"Cadabra,\" for \"Abracadabra,\" Bezos changed the name to \"Amazon\" before launch.\nAmazon started as an online bookstore because Bezos saw a potential opening in the world of bookselling. However, Bezos says that he always intended the store to offer a wide range of products. Amazon was also one of the first companies to argue that it was a \"technology\" firm regardless of underlying operations or revenue, establishing a trend that many online companies would later embrace. This position gave Amazon its early arguments for not charging state and local sales taxes, which many analysts believe gave it a key initial advantage against legacy competitors.\nThe company went public in 1997 with an initial, inflation-adjusted share price of $2.\u00a0It operated at a loss for years, with Amazon heavily investing in growth rather than profits. Amazon recorded its first profitable year in 2003.\nAmazon's other largest current brands emerged in the early 2000s. It began accepting third party sellers for the first time in 2000. Amazon Web Services launched in 2002, having emerged from a series of internal tools used to run the company's website. Amazon Prime launched in 2005, initially as a subscription service for fast, efficient delivery. In 2009 the company made its first major acquisition with Zappos, beginning its modern practice of making significant corporate expansions through acquisition.\nIt is difficult to briefly summarize all of Amazon's product and business lines because of the company's vast area of operations. Just some of its most relevant business lines include:\nOnline retail\nLarge scale physical retail, most notably through Whole Foods\nLogistics and delivery\nMedicine, including through PillPack\nTechnology devices such as the Kindle and Echo\nData services through Amazon Web Services\nArtificial intelligence development (Amazon is one of NVIDIA\u2019s largest customers)\nMovies and media, most notably through Prime streaming and Metro Goldwyn Mayer\nWeb publication\nClothing and fashion\nWithin this vast range of operations, three particularly stand out:\nAmazon is arguably best known for its online retail business. This is where the company started and, historically, has been the company's largest public profile. This business is split into two parts. Approximately 40% of Amazon's retail sales come from the company's traditional retail operations, in which it sells products directly to consumers.\u00a0The majority of these sales are third party products although not all, most notably with Amazon-produced devices such as the Kindle and Echo.\nAnother 60% of the company's retail sales come from third-party, or \"platform,\" sales. In this line of business, Amazon allows other individuals and companies to list products for sale on its site. It then collects a percentage of each sale, passing the rest along to the seller. Outlets have reported that this percentage is typically 50%.\nAlthough Amazon began as a bookseller, the company today operates as an \"everything\" store. There is no category limit on what Amazon sells and the company advertises its broad selection as one of the site's main features.\nSign up for the Market Minute newsletter for summaries of the latest stock and economic news, including updates on Amazon.\nCurrently, Amazon's brand has increasingly become synonymous with its \"Prime\" service. This is a subscription that costs $14.99 per month.\u00a0Through Prime, Amazon offers fast delivery of products, often next-day or even same-day. This requires a massive logistics operation and Amazon operates a wide range of warehouses, distance shipping and last-mile delivery, all to ensure that products are as close as possible to potential customers.\nThe Prime service is also associated with Amazon's streaming video service. This media operation has quietly become a significant portion of Amazon's reputation and operations, including the company's 2021 acquisition of movie studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Depending on how one measures subscriptions, Amazon Prime is the second-largest streaming service in the world, behind Netflix.\nIt is difficult to judge exactly how significant Amazon's media operations are as a revenue source. The company's high costs for original and licensed programming are specific and knowable. Its media revenue is more ambiguous, though. This money comes from Prime subscriptions, and its unclear on a per-customer basis how much enrollments are driven by media demand vs. Prime's associated retail benefits.\nEither way, media, streaming and Prime have become highly visible parts of Amazon's current brand.\nMost of Amazon's current operating income ($15.3 billion in Q1 2024) comes from Amazon Web Services, or \"AWS.\" This segment of Amazon's business currently accounts for more than half of the entire company's operating income at $9.4 billion in Q1 2024, and more than a fifth of its sales.\nAmazon Web Services is a cloud computing, data storage and analytics service. At its most basic, customers rent out storage space and processing power from Amazon. This means that they can store data on Amazon's servers and process customer requests on Amazon's computers. For example, when a customer watches Netflix, that video is stored on Amazon's hard drives and the company's processors stream the video out.\u00a0Beyond that, the company offers more than 200 different tools and services to help customers analyze data and monitor business operations.\nAmong other reasons, AWS has succeeded by offering efficient scalability to its customers. Startup companies don't need to purchase large stacks of expensive equipment, they can simple rent space on Amazon's computers. Existing firms can elastically expand or contract their monthly subscription based on current needs which, again, is less expensive than investing in capital equipment.\nAmazon's current financial era began in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBefore 2017, the company steadily reported net incomes within a range of several hundred million dollars. For example, a representative swing was between Amazon's $249 million positive net income in Q4 2013 and its $57 million net losses in Q1 2015. This range typifies the company's performance between 2003 and 2017, with most quarters posting positive net income.\nBetween the third and fourth quarter of 2017, Amazon's reported net income jumped by more than 700%. In Q3, 2017, Amazon reported $256 million income compared with $1.85 billion in Q4, 2017. This became the new normal. Except for Q1 and Q2, 2022, Amazon has reported billions of dollars in net income every quarter since.\nThis history is important for two reasons. First, Amazon\u2019s era of billion-dollar income did not begin until the same quarter that a very large, top-oriented tax cut took effect. According to the company\u2019s SEC filings, approximately half of the Q4 2017 income surge was due to taxes.\nSecond, Amazon's net income swung from $14.3 billion in Q4 2021 to a loss of $3.8 billion in Q1 2022. It posted losses for two quarters in 2022 before regaining positive net income. This coincided with the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to increase interest rates to push down inflation.\nWhile this does not give reason to believe that Amazon\u2019s business model is unstable, together these two events suggest that the company is significantly exposed to the political and financial climate. Changes in tax and interest policies appear able to swing Amazon\u2019s financial performance by billions of dollars in a single quarter.\nAt time of writing, the Amazon most recently reported $10.4 billion in quarterly profits (Q1, 2024).\nMoney is always in motion.

        "Text": "With shares up by a whopping 78% over the last 12 months, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is finally bouncing back from the slump it experienced in 2022 -- with profitability returning to historic highs. Is this trend just a fluke or the start of a new bull run? Let's dig deeper to see what the next five years could have in store for the iconic tech giant.\nWhile Amazon initially benefited from a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, this led to dramatic overexpansion in its staff and fulfillment infrastructure. When consumer spending softened in 2022 and 2023, the company was left with much lower margins and profits. \nThe main goal of CEO Andy Jassy, who took the helm in 2021, has been to streamline Amazon through layoffs and operational efficiencies. So far, the results have been impressive. While first-quarter net sales increased by a modest 13% to $143.3 billion, operating income surged by roughly 220% to $15.3 billion to mark the company's first double-digit (10.7%) operating margin on record. \nAmazon has managed to cut costs, particularly in its lumbering e-commerce business, where it streamlined its national fulfillment network by focusing on more efficient regional hubs spread across the country. It has also pivoted to higher-margin service-related businesses, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and digital advertising, which will play an increasingly important role for the company over the next five years. \nOver the next half-decade, Amazon's retail e-commerce operations will probably transition into a mature cash cow while new service-related ventures power the next leg of growth. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) might be the most promising opportunity. \nWhile Amazon is cutting operational costs, it is also ramping up capital spending into cloud-based AI projects like Bedrock, a platform designed to help clients train and run their large language models within Amazon's AWS ecosystem. And it is also developing its own custom chips called Trainium and Inferentia, designed to drive cost savings on the AWS platform and reduce dependence on third-party suppliers like Nvidia. \nIt is still unclear how big the global AI industry will become over the next few years. However, one analyst at New Street Research believes AI-related workloads could account for 21% of Amazon's AWS revenue by 2025 and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54% until 2027. \nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 43, Amazon stock is not cheap compared to the Nasdaq-100 average of around 30 -- especially considering the company's large size and modest top-line growth rate. That said, Amazon's valuation looks reasonable because of its convincing framework for improving profitability over the coming years.\nNew opportunities in AI infrastructure could lead to disproportionate growth in the AWS segment, which generally enjoys much higher margins than Amazon's core third-party marketplace. And management's cost-cutting efforts look far from over. According to Business Insider, the company now aims to reduce its physical office footprint, which will compound the cost efficiencies gained by its earlier workforce reductions.\nAmazon stock remains a strong long-term buy and looks capable of outperforming the wider market over the next five years.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $564,547!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?",
        "Author": "  Parker Schwartz, CFA ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is mainly known for its online retail marketplace, which has been a go-to website for individuals to find great deals on things ranging from large appliances to clothing, electronics and toys. If a product exists, you can be sure it can be found on Amazon.\nThe stock has doubled in price since its lows at the start of 2023. Shares have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and online retailer segment during this time.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAMZN Data by GuruFocus\nWhen people think of Amazon, they think of their e-commerce site, Amazon Prime and Prime Video. These segments account for almost 85% of the e-commerce giant's revenue and are a very important part of its business. This is what I am including in Amazon's traditional operating segments (essentially, everything but Amazon Web Services):\nOnline stores - revenue generated from selling items on Amazon.com.\nThird-party seller services - from fees from other businesses that sell on Amazon, which includes sales commissions, fees for inventory storage and shipping fees.\nAdvertising services - revenue generated from sponsored ads on Amazon.com and commercials on Prime Video.\nSubscription services - revenue from customer subscriptions to Amazon Prime.\nPhysical stores - revenue from physical store locations.\nOther - includes everything else from Amazon's health care services to fees from its credit card.\nThe growth in these segments is high, but has been slowing recently. The main reason is increased competition. Amazon was the major early-adopter in e-commerce and subscription-based shipping as well as a lesser early-adopter in online video streaming. However, competitors have caught up and have been slowly chipping away at Amazon's market share.\nAmazon has made some changes to better position itself in a crowded market. The biggest change is including commercials in its Prime Video offerings, which started this past January. This worried investors, but it has paid off. In the first quarter, subscription revenue rose over 20% compared to the prior year, showing consumers were fine with the change and kept their Amazon Prime subscriptions.\nAdvertising revenue also saw a benefit from that change, growing over 24% in the first quarter compared to the prior year.\nThe company also recently announced these commercials will soon allow Prime Video watchers to purchase advertised products during the break. I think this is a great and innovative idea from Amazon. Competing video streaming platforms are unable to replicate this functionality since none of them have their own e-commerce store. It is also important to note that Amazon has a lot of data about its subscribers and can target their commercials more effectively than competitors.\nAmazon Web Services, or AWS, is Amazon's cloud service. It generates revenue through cloud computing, storage and database services for various organizations.\nThe company has separated out its AWS revenue since 2013 and it has grown like a rocket, gaining almost 30 times in the last decade and accounting for 16% of sales.\nAWS is the leading provider within the cloud computing industry, accounting for almost a third of the market share.\nThe cloud services industry is expected to grow significantly over the next decade. Revenue is expected to be 20% higher in 2024 and triple current values by 2032.\nEven with rapid industry growth and increased competition, Amazon has been able to maintain market leadership and its 30% to 35% market share. There is no reason to believe that is going to change.\nDuring the first-quarter 2024 conference call, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavksy mentioned the importance of AWS and the investment Amazon is making to ensure its success:\n\"As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals, making bigger commitments. Still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI.\"\nAnalysts are forecasting 2024 annual revenue for Amazon just below $640 billion.\nThe company's enterprise value-sales ratio hovers around 3 historically. Morningstar analysts value Amazon using 3 times EV/sales, which I agree with. This leads to a fair value of $179.61 per share, which is currently just under 4% overvalued based on median revenue analyst estimates.\nI think Amazon is going to outperform analyst expectations and I am forecasting revenue to be above $643 billion. At 3 times EV/sales, this results in a price target of $181. Here is why I think Amazon is going to exceed analyst expectations:\nTraditional segment revenue is going to be higher than analysts expect. Advertising, online stores and third-party seller services are going to drive this outperformance through targeted commercials steering consumers to purchase more products from Amazon.\nAWS revenue is going to maintain its position as the market leader in the cloud industry and continue its 30% to 35% market share. This will be accomplished because Amazon is heavily investing in this growing space.\nAmazon revenue forecasted by analysts has surprisingly fallen over the last 90 days. This is despite the company beating expectations in the first quarter.\nAmazon is currently trading at $186.57, which is slightly higher than my valuation of $181. Even though I think that is slightly overvalued, I like the stock as an investment.\nThe GF Score agrees at 90 out of 100:\nThe most straightforward way to buy into Amazon is to simply purchase shares. However, investors have different ways to get exposure to Amazon and one alternative I really like is selling put options to purchase the stock.\nAmazon is currently slightly overvalued and put options can allow investors to collect some premium while potentially purchasing the stock at a specified price. As an example, we can look at options expiring at the end of May.\nI like the stock around $181 and analysts like it just under $180, so let's focus on put options with a strike price at $180.\nPut options at $180 for May 31 expiration are selling at around $1.25. Options are in contracts of 100, so if an investor sold this put option, they would receive $125 to purchase 100 shares of Amazon on that day at $180. If shares of Amazon are trading above $180, the option would expire worthless and the investor would keep the $125 premium. If the price is below $180 on that date, the investor would purchase 100 shares of Amazon at $180 (which requires $18,000 in available capital).\nIf an investor does not have the available cash to buy 100 shares of Amazon, or if they do not want that much exposure, then purchasing the shares outright is definitely the better choice. However, getting paid ($125) to buy a stock we like at a price we want ($180) is a great way to add income to your portfolio.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "The list of businesses that have rewarded investors more than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has in the past two decades is certainly very small. The tech juggernaut's shares have skyrocketed 4,760% since May 2004, making some people very rich along the way.\nWith the company now worth a whopping $1.9 trillion and having generated $575 billion in 2023 net sales, investors are probably wondering what the future holds. \nIs Amazon a good stock to buy right now? Here are some factors to consider.\nIf a business achieves the massive scale that Amazon has, it's reasonable to assume that there won't be much growth going forward. But here's where the company can prove you wrong. In fact, Amazon still has multiple growth engines it can lean on in the years ahead.\nHere in the U.S., online shopping currently makes up less than 16% of all retail spending. As e-commerce continues to steal share from brick-and-mortar retail, Amazon is poised to capture a large chunk of that trend. According to Statista, almost 40% of all the money spent online in this country goes through Amazon.\nWith Amazon Web Services (AWS), cloud computing is an area that the business is very focused on. This segment posted revenue growth of 17% in Q1, now at an annualized run rate of $100 billion. Given AWS' tremendous trailing-12-month operating margin of 31%, it's going to continue boosting the overall company's bottom line in the years ahead.\nThanks to its broad suite of AI-related products and services that can help businesses better serve their employees and customers, AWS is already finding demand from major clients, like Accenture, Siemens, and Volkswagen. As more companies keep transitioning to a cloud-based environment, AWS will look to be an even more important infrastructure partner.\nWith $11.8 billion in revenue in the last three months, digital advertising is undoubtedly becoming a more important aspect of the Amazon machine. With the popular online marketplace attracting so much attention, as well as the Prime Video streaming service, the company has valuable properties that it can monetize. \nAll of these powerful secular trends simply mean that Amazon is set to increase its sales. Wall Street consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to rise at a compound annual rate of 11.2% between 2023 and 2026.\nEven though the stock has been a fantastic winner historically, it's not expensive right now, trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 3.3. That's about in line with its trailing-10-year average.\nBesides the growth trends I discussed, investors would be acquiring a business that has a wide economic moat. In fact, Amazon is one of the most competitively advantaged enterprises on the face of the planet.\nFor starters, the company has unrivaled scale, particularly as it relates to the e-commerce segment. Amazon has spent so much time and money on building its sprawling logistics footprint that it can ship products at much lower cost than others. This will help the business maintain its lead when it comes to online shopping.\nIn the internet age, data is the new oil. The only difference is that data is infinite. Companies that can not only collect massive amounts of data, but also leverage it to better serve their user base, will continue to be the big winners.\nHere's where AWS truly shines. \"AWS not only has the broadest array of storage, database, analytics, and data management services for customers, it also has more customers and data store than anybody else,\" CEO Andy Jassy said on the Q2 2023 earnings call. This means the company has the insights that can inform its product development, solidifying its position as a mission-critical partner for clients.\nAmazon may be one of the world's most valuable companies.

        "Title": "3 Facts About Amazon Stock That Make It a Screaming Buy",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a great performer this year, as it's up more than 20%. However, I believe this is just the start of a much larger move.\nAmazon's business is starting to transform into something investors have never seen, and that's fantastic news. I've got three facts about Amazon that investors should know. While there are many more reasons to be interested in Amazon stock, I think these combine to make a compelling case to buy right now.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud computing business. This product allows clients to rent computing space from Amazon and run workloads over the cloud. This has become a popular strategy, allowing customers to scale their computing power up or down as needed. It's in great demand right now because many companies are attempting to create AI models to help their business run more efficiently.\nUnfortunately, throughout 2023, AWS didn't see this demand, while its competitors, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, did. But that tide seems to be turning. Amazon invested heavily in Anthropic, a generative AI start-up. This partnership gives AWS generative AI tools, which are offered on the AWS platform. CEO Andy Jassy stated in Amazon's Q1 conference call: \"We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.\"\nThis is great news for investors, and is already translating into financial results. In Q1, AWS net sales were up 17% year over year, and its operating income rose by 84%. Another catalyst helping AWS was the completion of the optimization trend. Last year, companies focused on cutting costs, which included optimizing cloud computing spending. Now that that trend is complete, AWS's business is seeing growth from new workloads, rather than falling revenue from shrinking workloads.\nAWS is Amazon's most profitable business segment, which is key to its success. However, other businesses are also starting to pull their weight.\nWhile AWS has been profitable for some time, Amazon's commerce divisions haven't always had that success. Amazon dug itself out of the hole it created in 2021 and 2022 for its North American division while it was building out its supply network. International has also long been an unprofitable endeavor for Amazon, but it's also starting to come around. Q1 was the first profitable quarter for the segment since 2021.\nThis bolstered Amazon's cash generation, which is starting to gain momentum.\nOver the past 12 months, Amazon generated $50.1 billion in free cash flow (FCF). This is a significant improvement from the $3.3 billion FCF outflow in Q1 of last year. However, the trends associated with this FCF are also exciting.\nThe first quarter is a historically weak one for Amazon, mainly due to the massive spending during Q4. As a result, you can see a relative peak in the chart below at the start of each new year, followed by a significant decline. The same thing happened in 2024, but this was the first year in a while that this drawdown didn't cross into the negative zone. Furthermore, the peak in Q4 was the highest it has ever been.\nAs a result, it's clear Amazon's cash flows are improving and are sustainable, which investors love. As Amazon's cash flows increase, it can initiate a dividend or start repurchasing stock, which is great news for long-term investors.\nBut the last fact about Amazon shows why it's still a buy right now.\nBecause Amazon is still optimizing its profitability, the valuation metrics centered around earnings aren't useful (although they may be next year). As a result, I'll use its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.\nDespite its strong cash flow growth and massive improvements across the business, it's still valued at a level last seen during its drawdown after COVID demand subsided, and before that in 2018.\nThis tells me the stock isn't absurdly overvalued, and could be a reasonable purchase today.\nWith all of Amazon's growth prospects plus its growing FCF, I think Amazon is a great buy right now. There's still plenty to be transformed within Amazon's business, and investors will benefit from buying and holding it for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$190 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$167. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Amazon.com's current trading price of US$184 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Amazon.com\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nAmazon.com appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that Amazon.com\u2019s ratio of 50.69x is above its peer average of 24.64x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Multiline Retail industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Amazon.com\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Amazon.com's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in AMZN\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe AMZN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for AMZN, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Amazon.com from their most recent forecasts.

The business \u2014 which Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hired Selipsky to run in 2021 \u2014 saw operating profits nearly double to $9.4 billion.\nThe division represented about 62% of Amazon's Q1 operating profits.\nSelipsky contends that with 85% of companies still storing their data on-premise, the tailwinds for AWS are just beginning to gust.\n\"We're optimistic about the business outlook for AWS and I think it can continue to grow really rapidly. I don't really see an upper limit on it,\" Selipsky says. \"Of course it's not our birthright, it's not guaranteed. We'll only be as successful as what we do tomorrow for customers.\"\nThe avid water skier and wine aficionado says he doesn't wake up each day thinking about crushing rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Rather, he spends his time plotting out how to keep customers happy \u2014 part of the \"Day One\" culture etched into the company by founder Jeff Bezos.\nWall Street believes Selipsky and his AWS team will continue to be the main drivers of Amazon's profits \u2014 and stock price.\n\"Drivers [of AWS] are strong and sustainable \u2014 the ending of cost optimization cycles, core cloud demand, and Gen AI workloads that are amounting to a multi-billion revenue run rate,\" Evercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney said in a client note following Amazon's earnings.\nMahaney continued, \"Key is that this marked the first quarter since the third quarter of 2022 that AWS dollar revenue growth surpassed that of [Microsoft] Azure, which changes the cloud industry leadership narrative.\"\nThe Magnificent Seven trade \u2014 Microsoft, Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 has swung back to life amid strong earnings from the aforementioned Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.

        "Title": "This is the Amazon everyone should have feared",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "A little less than six years ago, I wrote an article with a similar headline to this newsletter.\nAt the time, Amazon had once again posted its largest quarterly profit in history\u2014$2.5 billion at the time\u2014on the back of its two fastest-growing businesses that hadn\u2019t even existed when Jeff Bezos took the company public: Amazon Web Services and Amazon Advertising.\n\u201cAn Amazon that is posting growing profits from its non-core business,\u201d I wrote back in 2018, \u201cmeans an Amazon that can continue to keep prices low and invest in ever-speedier delivery times to widen its defensive moat in its main retail business. That should be a very scary realization for rivals.\u201d\nAnd it mostly has been. Fast forward to last week, when Amazon announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Amazon\u2019s net income surpassed $10 billion for the quarter and would have exceeded $12 billion if not for a $2 billion non-cash expense from its investment in the electric carmaker Rivian.\nOn the revenue side, its year-over-year growth rates accelerated across the board, for its AWS, advertising, and core e-commerce divisions, respectively. That\u2019s a revenue acceleration even as AWS is on track to surpass $100 billion in annual sales by the end of 2024, while its investments in what could be a transformational technology of generative AI are just ramping up. The law of large numbers doesn\u2019t seem to be holding AWS back.\nMeanwhile, Amazon\u2019s ad business should top $50 billion for the first time in 2024, and that\u2019s with the tech giant just starting to really court TV advertisers to buy ads on Prime Video, thanks to its deal to stream NFL games\u2014and, soon, NBA basketball games too.\nOver the decade-plus that I\u2019ve covered this company, it\u2019s become common for stock analysts to ask Amazon officials on earnings calls whether the company is currently operating in more of an investing cycle than a profits one, or vice versa. And on last week\u2019s earnings call, an analyst posed such a question once again. But the answer was much different than ever before.\n\u201cI think we're in a position to do both is the short answer,\u201d Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the call. \u201cI think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses\u2014in the stores business along with advertising and AWS\u2014there's a lot of growth in front of us. And I think we're investing in a meaningful way. But I think\u2026we don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side.\u201d\nFor the first time in a very long time\u2014maybe in the company\u2019s 30-year history\u2014Amazon is at a point where it can afford \u201cto do both.\u201d That\u2019s noteworthy.\nTo be clear, the company is facing myriad challenges, including some self-induced. Its plans to reinvent brick-and-mortar shopping through technology haven\u2019t gone as planned. The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, however unlikely, could someday force the company to overhaul its business or even split it into parts. Amazon\u2019s relationship with the hundreds of thousands of sellers who account for 60% of the company\u2019s product sales has probably never been worse no matter what Amazon\u2019s CEO says. And as the nascent generative AI sector has boomed, Amazon has found itself in some instances trailing competitors.\nBut for today, considering the financial results Amazon is showing, and considering the fact that the company is finally at a size that it can, as Jassy said on the earnings call, both invest aggressively in its future while also pumping out real profits, this certainly feels like the Amazon everyone should have feared.\nAgain.\nJason Del Rey\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThe rest of today\u2019s Data Sheet was written by David Meyer.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Results: Amazon.com, Inc. Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Investors in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a good week, as its shares rose 6.4% to close at US$185 following the release of its first-quarter results. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$143b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Amazon.com surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$0.98 per share, a notable 18% above expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Amazon.com after the latest results.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Amazon.com's 56 analysts is for revenues of US$638.8b in 2024. This reflects a solid 8.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to surge 23% to US$4.44. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$641.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.15 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\nThere's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$216, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Amazon.com, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$245 and the most bearish at US$180 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Amazon.com's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Amazon.com's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 11% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 17% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 10% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Amazon.com is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Amazon.com's earnings potential next year. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$216, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Amazon.com analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\nYou can also see our  analysis of Amazon.com's Board and CEO remuneration and experience, and whether company insiders have been buying stock.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Matt Frankel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "According to Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) most recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Jeff Bezos beneficially owns approximately 1.12 billion shares of the company's stock, giving him a 10.8% stake in the business. As you might expect, this makes Bezos Amazon's largest shareholder, and by a wide margin. As of this writing, Bezos' shares are worth about $207 billion.\nBeyond Bezos, Amazon's largest shareholders are institutional investors, as is the case with most publicly traded companies. Financial institutions that offer index funds must own a certain amount of the stock to track certain indices. For example, an S&P 500 index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) must own Amazon stock in proportion to its weight in the index based on the fund's total assets.\nSo, Vanguard is the largest Amazon shareholder, with 7.4% of Amazon shares held by Vanguard funds and their investors. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) -- also a major index fund operator -- is the No. 2 non-Bezos shareholder, with 6.1% of the company's stock.\nAs far as individual investors go, the answer is a little tricky. Unless you're a board member of a public company, a key executive, or own more than 5% of the outstanding shares, your investment isn't required to be publicly disclosed. However, of the people in those groups, Amazon CEO (and longtime company executive) Andy Jassy is the largest reported individual shareholder after Jeff Bezos. At the end of 2023, Jassy owned 2,119,566 shares of Amazon, a stake worth about $390 million.\nThere's a special case when it comes to Amazon, however. MacKenzie Scott (Bezos' ex-wife) received about 4% of Amazon's shares as part of the couple's 2019 divorce. She has since sold off quite a bit of the stake but still owns quite a bit and is the company's largest individual shareholder besides Jeff Bezos.\nAs part of the divorce agreement, Bezos retained voting rights to Scott's shares, so they are included in his reported ownership. However, the latest proxy clarifies that Bezos' share count includes 184,282,131 shares \"as to which Mr. Bezos has sole voting power and no investment power.\"\nThis implies that Bezos actually owns about 938 million shares, giving him and Scott 9% and 1.8% stakes in the company, respectively.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): Prepping for Its Next Decade of Growth with AWS",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "E-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is poised for the next decade of growth after delivering a\u00a0return of around 1,000%\u00a0over the last decade.\u00a0Thanks to its recent earnings beat, the stock price recently hit a new all-time high. Despite these gains, Amazon\u2019s reaccelerated AWS growth, bolstered by AI, strong retail momentum, and margin and cash-flow expansion from optimization initiatives, make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I\u2019ll buy the stock at current levels.\nOn April 30, Amazon reported\u00a0impressive Q1 results\u00a0for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all segments, including cloud, advertising, and e-commerce. Adjusted earnings of $0.98\u00a0per share handily beat analysts\u2019 estimates of $0.84 per share. Also, earnings more than trebled (+216%) year-over-year compared to earnings of $0.31 per share in the prior-year period.\nFurther, net sales soared 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, and sales for Amazon\u2019s cloud business segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grew 17% year-over-year to $25 billion, beating expectations. Segment growth was aided by renewed demand and investments in generative AI, which boosted AWS\u2019s performance, alongside a near cessation of the cost optimizations that customers had resorted to last year.\nParticularly\u00a0noteworthy\u00a0is that AWS\u2019s operating income jumped 84.3% year-over-year to $9.4 billion. Further, there was a significant operating margin expansion in the segment from 24% in the prior-year quarter to 37.6% currently.\nRegion-wise, North America sales grew 12% year-over-year, with International segment revenue growth at 11% (in constant currency). Moreover, operating income for all the company\u2019s segments combined jumped by 219% year-over-year to $15.3 billion.\nBased on its robust Q1 performance, Amazon provided an optimistic Q2 outlook, above expectations. Q2 net sales are projected to grow between 7-11% to be in the range of $144-149 billion. Notably, operating income guidance of $10-14 billion ($12 billion at the midpoint) is also much higher compared to the $7.7 billion generated in the first quarter of 2023.\nAWS, Amazon\u2019s cloud business, has long been the market leader and the profit engine for the company for years. However, after years of impressive growth, the segment saw a slowdown, with growth decelerating to 13% in 2023 compared to 29% in 2022 and 37% in 2021.\nThat downtrend is now history. In Q1, AWS\u2019s sales grew 17%, helping AWS reach the much-anticipated $100 billion run rate milestone in revenues. Additionally, operating income for the segment saw a remarkable growth of 84%.\nArtificial intelligence\u00a0(AI) is the catalyst behind this stupendous growth witnessed at AWS during the quarter. As a matter of fact, the tech titans of the world like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been investing heavily in AI technology.\nFor instance, Microsoft\u2019s Azure has gained market share in the cloud space, now holding a 25% share versus 19% in 2021. The addition of AI tools has been a contributing factor toward Azure\u2019s rapid growth over the years. Like its peers, Amazon is making meaningful investments in AI and developing its own large language models as well as investing billions in AI products like Anthropic (which competes with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT).\nAmazon\u2019s investments in AI are now reaping benefits and showing up in the financial figures. The company stated that the majority of its FY2024 CapEx (capital expenditures) will be toward bolstering AWS infrastructure and AI efforts. As the cloud leader, AWS can significantly monetize the growing demand for AI with its wide variety of cloud offerings.\nIt\u2019s not just the margin expansion that impressed investors in Q1. It was a huge jump in\u00a0cash flows despite substantial capital investments in AI and cloud infrastructure. This reassured investors that Amazon\u2019s fundamentals remain intact. Q1 free cash flows grew to $50.1 billion (Q4: $36.8 billion) compared to cash outflows of $3.3 billion a year ago. Margin expansion, coupled with robust free cash flows, implies strong returns for investors in the years to come.\nEarlier this week, there was news that AWS is looking to invest billions in Italy to strengthen its cloud infrastructure and data center operations in the country. Similarly, AWS will invest billions in Spain (\u20ac15.7 billion) and Germany (\u20ac7.8 billion) with the aim of expanding its cloud business across European countries.\nAmazon has been undertaking key initiatives to streamline the company\u2019s operations as well as bring down costs. These steps include transforming the U.S. fulfillment model from a nationwide one to a regional one and synchronizing inventory with the regional consumers, among others.\nOn a separate note, Amazon recently announced the departure of its AWS head, Adam Selipsky. He will be replaced by Matt Garman, an AWS veteran, to become the CEO of AWS. This leadership change may further enhance Amazon\u2019s AI growth initiatives.\nAs Amazon houses multiple businesses under its radar, I believe the EV/EBITDA ratio is the best metric to evaluate the stock\u2019s valuation. Being an industry leader, the company has historically traded at high multiples. At present, however, Amazon stock is trading at around 14.3x EV/EBITDA (on a forward basis) compared to its own five-year historical average of 20.6x. This implies a huge 31% discount.\nFor the sake of comparison, let\u2019s also look at its P/S ratio. Amazon is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.0x. In contrast, cloud computing and tech giant Microsoft trades at a P/S of 13.1x, while social networking company Meta Platforms \u00a0(NASDAQ:META) trades at a\u00a0P/S of 7.7x.\nTherefore, I believe the stock is trading at an attractive valuation and presents a great buying opportunity, given the strong growth potential across various business verticals.\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Amazon stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the impressive earnings beat. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 42 unanimous Buys.\u00a0Amazon stock\u2019s average price target\u00a0of $220.60 implies 20.5% upside potential from current levels.\nAmazon may have been a little late to the AI growth story, but it\u2019s important to remember that AWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure. Its substantial investments and recent leadership changes should yield significant benefits. The foundation has been laid, and I believe there\u2019s no turning back for Amazon.\nWith multiple growth drivers, including AWS\u2019s growth trajectory fueled by generative AI initiatives, a well-diversified business portfolio, strong retail performance, and impressive margin and cash-flow expansion, Amazon appears well-positioned for its next phase of growth. Therefore, I am confident in buying the stock at its current levels.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Spencer Soper ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. merchants have found themselves caught in an economic vice.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind\nMacron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe\nBiden Adds Tariffs on Chinese Chips, Critical Minerals, EVs\nTesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk\u2019s Cuts\nFive Under-the-Radar Billionaires Making Vast Fortunes in Modi's India\nEarlier this year, the e-commerce giant rolled out changes to the fees its charges them \u2014 essentially shifting more of its operating costs onto the small businesses that account for most of the products sold on the site. Making matters worse for merchants, shoppers are trading down.\nIn the first four months of the year, American consumers have increasingly opted for the least expensive products in nearly all categories, according to a report released Thursday by Adobe Inc. That makes it harder to pass price hikes along to shoppers, and online merchants are struggling to make money.\nDuncan Freer, who sells weighted blankets and sleep masks on Amazon, expects his profit margin to slide to 8% from 20% as a result of the new fees. One, imposed in March, charges a levy on shipments sent to the company\u2019s fulfillment centers. That will drive the cost of shipping two pallets of Freer\u2019s products to Amazon to more than $800, up four-fold from what it cost him in October, he said. Amazon reduced the cost of fulfilling each customer order, but Freer said it only partially offsets the new fees.\n\u201cAmazon just keeps grabbing more and more,\u201d said the Chicago businessman, whose sales on the marketplace amount to about $500,000 a year. \u201cIt\u2019s like a kick in the gut.\u201d\nAmazon said the new fees are intended to reflect its own cost of distributing inventory around the US so more items can be delivered in just one day, which helps boost overall sales for online merchants. Some fees actually went down. In January, Amazon cut commissions for sellers of low-cost apparel, a move interpreted by merchants as an effort to blunt competition from Chinese fast-fashion startup Shein.\n\u201cWhen we announced these new fee changes in December, we estimated that sellers will on average see an increase of $0.15 per unit sold, which is significantly less than the average fee increases announced by other fulfillment service providers,\u201d company spokeswoman Mira Dix said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs sellers are adapting to these changes we have seen that the actual impact is even lower, and many more sellers are seeing a decrease in the average fees that they are paying to Amazon.\u201d\nStill, many merchants say Amazon is mostly benefiting from the higher fees, an assertion reflected in the company\u2019s earnings. Revenue from seller services, which includes the popular Fulfillment by Amazon logistics operation, increased at a faster rate than fulfillment expenses in each of the past seven quarters. Amazon\u2019s seller services revenue of $34.6 billion for the period ended March 30 was up 36.5% from two years earlier, more than triple the pace of growth of its fulfillment costs, which were $22.3 billion in the period.\nIn last month\u2019s earnings report, the cloud computing division\u2019s strong performance overshadowed the growing tension between Amazon and its sellers. Amazon Web Services in the first quarter contributed more than 60% of the company\u2019s operating income even though it accounts for less than 20% of revenue. But sales in the core e-commerce business grew at a slower pace than the number of units sold, another indication that consumers are watching their budgets. Amazon\u2019s marketplace model helps the company keep growing through a slowdown by charging fees for advertising and logistics.\nAntonio Bindi, a Brazilian businessman who has sold home storage and kitchen products on Amazon for five years, said the fee structure is getting increasingly complex. Of particular concern: a levy introduced in April charged when sellers\u2019 inventory runs low. That\u2019s on top of previous storage fees that increase when slow-selling inventory lingers in Amazon warehouses. It\u2019s too much for his 20-person team to manage, so he\u2019s whittling his catalog of 500 products down to 400 to simplify the operation.\nFive years ago, he said, \u201cAmazon was a platform that would facilitate your business operations and let you focus on what you\u2019re good at, like creating great products. You could just send your products to Amazon, and they\u2019d take care of everything. Now you need an entire department to deal with the complexity. The costs are prohibitive.\u201d\nSan Francisco seller Neil Ayton sells golf yardage books, yoga gear and pickleball equipment. One of his most popular products is a yoga stick practitioners use to stretch. It was 59 inches, the longest it could be to avoid a higher fee tier. Earlier this year, he noticed Amazon cut the size limit, and suddenly his yoga sticks were one inch too long. Shipping costs for each product jumped from $10 to $26, and Ayton began losing $3 per sale. He recalled hundreds of yoga sticks from Amazon warehouses and trimmed an inch off each one, but said doing so merely minimized his losses. Now he plans to wind down his Amazon business.\n\u201cAmazon kind of teases you,\u201d Ayton said. \u201cIt\u2019s great when it\u2019s working nicely, but you never know what surprise is coming tomorrow.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives\nCheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges\nUS East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia\u2019s Shifting Exports\n\u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon has been one of the best-performing stocks in the history of the stock market, and new advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have created a new wellspring of opportunity for the e-commerce king.\nHowever, while Amazon may continue to grow and gain, there's another e-commerce company that's growing faster and might have even greater opportunities. If you're looking for a powerhouse growth stock with massive potential, consider MercadoLibre stock (NASDAQ: MELI).\nIt's not easy to boast high sales growth for long periods of time, but MercadoLibre continues to wow the market with consistently high revenue increases. They accelerated early in the pandemic to triple-digit numbers, and now they've decelerated comfortably into high double digits.\nSince MercadoLibre is headquartered and operates in Latin America, it reports numbers both actual and currency-neutral. These two sets of metrics aren't usually all that different, but recently there's been wide divergence for international companies, and it's important for investors to keep both sets of numbers in mind.\nRevenue increased 36% year-over-year in the 2024 first quarter, not too bad, but 94% currency neutral, which is outstanding.\nMercadoLibre's main business is e-commerce, and gross merchandise volume (GMV) increased 71% year over year (currency neutral) in the first quarter, driven by a 25% increase in items sold. MercadoLibre operates in 18 Latin American countries, and while they're all in the same overall region, they have varied economies and provide a level of diversification to its business. There was major economic pressure in Argentina during the first quarter, and GMV growth in Argentina was 215%, which was below the rate of inflation, with a 4% decline in items sold. Unique active user growth decelerated to 1.5%. However, a strong showing in its two other large markets, Brazil and Mexico, largely offset these slowdowns. Items sold per unique buyers increased 7% year over year.\nThe company has expanded into offering fintech services, and this is its fastest-growing segment. Total payment volume increased 35% year over year in the quarter, or 85% currency-neutral. Fintech's monthly active users increased 38% year over year, and the credit portfolio increased 46% to $4.4 billion.\nMercadoLibre is still in a high-growth phase, but it's demonstrating consistent profitability. Net income increased by more than 70% year over year in the first quarter with a 7.9% margin.\nMercadoLibre is still much smaller than Amazon, with only $14.5 billion in trailing-12-month sales vs. Amazon's $591 billion. It can enjoy years of high growth and still remain a smaller company, which gives it decades of growth opportunities and potential for shareholder gains.\nSome of its initiatives are similar to those of Amazon. It offers its own fulfillment network, and as more suppliers use it, it can get deliveries out faster and cheaper. It recently launched Meli+, which is similar to Amazon Prime, and members are engaging and spending more. It also recently rolled out its own innovation, Meli Delivery Day, which is like allowing shoppers to use the slower (and sometimes cheaper) option on Amazon, with the twist of having a specific day of the week when shoppers get all of their shipments.\nIts focus is currently on e-commerce and fintech, unlike Amazon's more diversified portfolio of businesses. However, MercadoLibre entered the fintech space after becoming a leader in e-commerce, a natural complement to its business because shoppers needed alternative payment methods. It has been growing that business in new directions, such as credit cards and other credit products.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "As some of the world's most valuable companies, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) have long histories of providing investors with significant and consistent gains. Their shares are up 1,000% and 516% respectively over the past decade -- and the companies still have promising prospects as they expand their reach.\nThe shares look like particularly attractive options for anyone aiming to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). Demand for AI services has skyrocketed over the last year, with Amazon and Alphabet well-equipped to meet demand with their respective cloud platforms. These tech giants are investing heavily in the budding AI market, and could see significant gains as the sector develops.\nSo let's compare these companies' businesses and determine whether Amazon or Alphabet is the better AI stock right now.\nAmazon's stock price has popped 4% since April 30, when the company posted its earnings for the first quarter of 2024. During the period, revenue increased by 13% year over year to $43 billion, outperforming analysts' expectations by $750 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share estimates came in at $0.98 against forecasts of $0.83.\nThe promising results come after a range of cost-cutting measures and heavy investment in AI, which has put the company on a promising growth trajectory. Recent moves are paying off for the company, with Q1 2024 operating income soaring 221% to just under $15 billion.\nMuch of Amazon's profit growth is owed to its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has added several new AI tools since last year. Companies are increasingly turning to cloud services to integrate AI into their businesses. Meanwhile, AWS is the world's biggest cloud platform, accounting for 31% of the market.\nIn addition to cloud computing, Amazon has multiple ways to boost its business with AI. By improving its AI technology, the company can more accurately follow shopping trends and recommend products on its retail site, offer more efficient advertising on Prime Video, improve shipping logistics, and more.\nConsequently, it might be worth buying Amazon's stock while it is still at the beginning of its journey into AI.\nLike Amazon, Alphabet has a potent position in the tech sector that will likely strengthen further as it continues to expand its AI capabilities.\nThe Google parent's shares have risen 6% just since April 25, rallying investors with promising Q1 2024 earnings. The quarter saw Alphabet's revenue rise 15% year over year to $81 billion, outperforming Wall Street's expectations by $2 billion.\nOver the past year, investors have grown concerned that Alphabet has fallen behind rivals like Amazon and Microsoft in AI. However, its latest quarterly results seemed to temper those fears, as revenue from its AI-centered Google Cloud segment spiked 28% year over year. Meanwhile, its advertising sales rose 14%.\nThe stellar growth proved that Alphabet's venture into AI is paying off as it attracts new cloud clients and optimizes its digital advertising business. Alongside various budget cuts, Alphabet will likely continue to see consistent earnings and stock price gains in the coming years.\nAmazon and Alphabet seem to be at the top of their games after recent earnings releases, with both company's results proving that AI is a worthy venture. So the question is, which company's stock is more likely to deliver bigger gains over the long term and perhaps see a bigger return from AI?\nWith the AI industry still in its infancy, it's impossible to know the answers to these questions. In all likelihood, the best application for AI hasn't even been thought of yet, and it's impossible to know which company will profit most from the industry. As a result, it could be best to go with the company that currently has a stronger position in the sector and has gotten a better start, as market dominance is often challenging to take down once it is achieved.\nAnd with that, Amazon looks like the better and more reliable AI stock. The company's leading cloud market share has given it an advantage in AI. AWS has an impressive clientele, including top companies like Netflix, Sony, and Meta Platforms, and has made Amazon the go-to for AI cloud services.\nAdditionally, Amazon's price-to-sales ratio of 3 -- compared to Alphabet's 6 -- potentially makes Amazon's shares a better value. Amazon's stock is a screaming buy and a better option over Alphabet right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, a sign that the retailer\u2019s most profitable unit is recovering from a slump as businesses resume spending on technology projects, including artificial intelligence services.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIsrael Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Far Short\nAt $2 Million Per Minute, Treasuries Mint Cash Like Never Before\nEx-Trump Controller Says Cohen Repaid From Personal Account\nJack Dorsey Leaves Bluesky Board, Calls X \u2018Freedom Technology\u2019\nTruce Talks Drag as Hamas Hits Israel Crossing in Deadly Attack\nDespite the strong cloud performance, the company\u2019s sales forecast for the current quarter fell short of estimates, reflecting concern about the main e-commerce business as consumers continue to spend cautiously.\nChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy in recent years has cut costs and focused on profitability in Amazon\u2019s online shopping business, laying off thousands of people and touting a more efficient warehouse network. At the same time, he\u2019s backed big investments in artificial intelligence services that Amazon expects to generate tens of billions in revenue in the coming years. Those sales are starting to materialize.\nThe Seattle-based company posted first-quarter operating profit of $15.3 billion. Revenue increased 13% to $143.3 billion in the period ended March 31, Amazon said Tuesday in a statement. Both figures topped analysts\u2019 estimates.\nSales in the Amazon Web Services cloud unit were $25 billion, up 17% from a year earlier. Analysts estimated AWS sales of $24.1 billion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing strong demand signals from our customers on the AWS side,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. \u201cThey\u2019re signing longer deals with larger commitments, many with generative AI components.\u201d Olsavsky said generative artificial intelligence now represented a \u201cmulti-billion dollar revenue run rate business\u201d for Amazon, the first time the company has publicly put even an approximate figure on that franchise.\nThat will come at a cost. The AI chatbots, data-crunching tools, and other software that respond to queries from users are possible only thanks to massive quantities of cutting-edge computer chips. Olsavsky said Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures would \u201cmeaningfully increase\u201d in 2024, primarily to support AWS growth, including for generative AI. The company has said it will spend more than $150 billion to build out and operate data centers in the coming years.\nSales growth at the cloud unit had slowed to a record low last year as businesses cut back on technology spending and sought to curb computing bills that ballooned during the pandemic. Investors have been banking on a rebound this year, particularly after strong results last week from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon\u2019s two main rivals in the business of renting computing power and data storage.\nAWS generated a profit of $9.42 billion in the quarter. The unit\u2019s operating margin \u2014 37.6% \u2014 is the widest since Amazon began disclosing sales for its cloud business. The division held its largest-ever layoffs last year, and has continued to trim its ranks selectively, even as it hires in other areas.\nAmazon said revenue will be $144 billion to $149 billion in the period ending in June. Analysts, on average, projected $150.2 billion.\nThe company\u2019s main e-commerce business reported sales of $54.6 billion in the quarter, slightly missing analysts\u2019 estimates. Olsavsky said consumers continue to trade down to save money. Shoppers are ordering more consumables, which they need quickly, but also cost less than other categories, he said. That puts pressure on the profitability of the business because Amazon has to process and deliver more units.\nThe slowing e-commerce sales also have pushed Amazon to seek greater growth for other business lines. For example, advertising revenue rose 24% to $11.8 billion. The results reflect the first quarter since Amazon introduced video advertising to the Prime Video streaming service.\nAmazon shares gained 3.2% to $180.59 as the markets opened in New York.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The projected fair value for Amazon.com is US$304 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$189 suggests Amazon.com is potentially 38% undervalued\n Analyst price target for AMZN is US$217 which is 29% below our fair value estimate\nHow far off is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$62.4b\nUS$79.0b\nUS$102.7b\nUS$116.6b\nUS$141.2b\nUS$159.6b\nUS$175.2b\nUS$188.5b\nUS$199.8b\nUS$209.7b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x16\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x9\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 12.98%\nEst @ 9.80%\nEst @ 7.57%\nEst @ 6.02%\nEst @ 4.93%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% \nUS$58.2k\nUS$68.8k\nUS$83.4k\nUS$88.4k\nUS$99.8k\nUS$105.2k\nUS$107.8k\nUS$108.2k\nUS$107.0k\nUS$104.8k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$932b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$210b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.2%\u2013 2.4%) = US$4.5t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.5t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$2.2t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.2t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$189, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.044. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +56.6%. This estimate has changed +14.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $148.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $638.26 billion and $709.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +11.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Amazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "(Correction: An earlier version of this story said Amazon will lease the freighters from ATSG. Amazon is providing the aircraft in this service agreement.)\nAmazon is providing 10 additional freighter aircraft to Air Transport Services Group to operate on its behalf over five years as part of a deal that deepens relations between the companies and underscores how the retailer is gaining in the U.S. parcel market.\nATSG (NASDAQ: ATSG) announced late Monday that it will begin flying the Boeing 767-300 cargo jets for Amazon\u2019s logistics network this summer, with the potential to add another 10 aircraft, under a five-year contract. ATSG did not say where Amazon is obtaining the aircraft.\nThe agreement also extends the existing flying contract, which runs until March 2026, for three more years and includes the award to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of an additional 2.9 million warrants to purchase ATSG shares.\n\nBy the end of the year, ATSG said it expects to operate 50 of the medium widebody freighters on Amazon\u2019s behalf.\nAmazon already owns 19.5% of the Wilmington, Ohio-based aircraft leasing and aviation services company after exercising warrants in 2021. ATSG has been one of Amazon\u2019s primary air transportation providers ever since the e-commerce giant launched its in-house cargo airline in 2016. ATSG said it also agreed to give Amazon more time to exercise vested warrants for 21.8 million shares previously issued to Amazon, as well as for unvested warrants for 2.9 million shares.\nThe new Amazon deal boosted ATSG\u2019s full-year outlook for adjusted core operating activities by $10 million, to $516 million, from the figure presented in February. The projection includes costs associated with bringing the converted freighters into service.\nAmazon\u2019s decision is a boon for airline subsidiary ABX Air, which will hire more than 50 pilots to support the contract after several years in Amazon\u2019s doghouse because the pilots union conducted an unannounced strike on the eve of Black Friday and essentially shut down Amazon\u2019s delivery network for more than a day. The Airline Professionals Association, which is under the Teamsters umbrella, has recently taken great pains to promote ATSG and the company\u2019s service quality in an effort to drum up business and, in due course, a strong contract for the pilots.\n\nABX Air currently operates 24 B767 aircraft but only about four freighters within Amazon\u2019s air network.\nATSG provides and flies 30 Boeing 767 freighters for Amazon. Amazon provides 10 more aircraft that ATSG operates on its behalf. Amazon owns eight of those planes and leases two of them from the leasing arm of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, which also has a cargo airline in business with Amazon. Amazon relies on outsourced airlift because it technically isn\u2019t a true airline with pilots of its own and an operator\u2019s certificate. The amended transportation services agreement brings to 50 the total number of aircraft operated within Amazon\u2019s air network.\nThe arrangement essentially reverses Amazon\u2019s decision to return 12 Boeing 767-200 converted freighters when their leases expired \u2013 seven last month and five last year. The difference, however, is that ATSG won\u2019t receive leasing revenue. It will be paid for providing crews, maintenance and insurance. The 767-200s are older and smaller than the 767-300s.\nA year ago it was unclear whether Amazon planned to reduce business with ATSG after not immediately replacing the relinquished 767-200s as e-commerce demand softened and Amazon added Hawaiian Airlines as a partner carrier to operate large Airbus A330 freighters.\nAlthough online shopping demand has decreased since exploding to record heights during the pandemic, Amazon has gained parcel volume and taken market share from FedEx and UPS in the U.S. market, according to recent research from Pitney Bowes. Amazon shipped 5.9 billion packages last year, up 16% y/y and second only to the U.S. Postal Service.\nATSG\u2019s revenue for the first quarter was $486 million, down 3% year over year. It reported adjusted operating income of $15.2 million, down $22.6 million from the same period in 2023. Results were better than analysts expected.\nLeasing revenue decreased 7% in the quarter, reflecting the return of 16 widebody freighters since March 2023 and reduced flight tempo by network customers like Amazon and DHL Express. ATSG\u2019s transportation services contracts include maintenance. When aircraft fly fewer hours, the company generates less revenue from an engine maintenance program that is based on the number of cycles put on the engines. In the past year, ATSG also leased 15 freighters, including three Airbus A321 narrowbody freighters.\nDuring the first quarter, ATSG deployed four newly converted 767-300 freighters to external customers. In March, Uzbekistan-based My Freighter received a 767 from ATSG.\n\nATSG, which released earnings after the market closed, said revenue from its cargo airlines, ABX Air and Air Transport International, dipped 3.3% with three fewer aircraft in service than a year ago. Cargo flight hours decreased 3% during the first quarter, primarily due to greater deployment on shorter domestic routes and less international flying.\nATSG has 114 converted cargo jets in service, two more than at the end of 2023, with 46 leased to other airlines. It also operates 19 passenger charter jets through a company called Omni Air International. An additional 24 passenger aircraft acquired by ATSG are in, or awaiting, cargo modification at airframe overhaul facilities.\nInvestors have beaten down ATSG\u2019s stock over the past 18 months over concerns management was continuing to acquire aircraft for freighter conversions while the global air cargo market was in a major slump. Management insisted its long-term strategy would pay off as the market recovered, but it responded to the pressure by reducing its capital budget and terminating CEO Rich Corrado in October.\nThe Amazon commitment for more freighters should improve investor confidence in the company\u2019s ability to deliver returns, especially after ATSG also said it generated $15 million in free cash flow during the first quarter.\nATSG\u2019s stock price increased 6.4% to $14.10 per share in after hours trading.\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\u00a0\nABX Air pilots choose cooperation over confrontation\nCargo airline sends new Boeing 767 freighters directly to storage\nInflation tempers Cargojet\u2019s outlook despite Q1 volume growth\nThe post Amazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Amazon (AMZN). Shares have added about 1.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Amazon due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nAmazon.com delivered first-quarter 2024 earnings of 98 cents per share compared with 31 cents in the year-ago quarter.AMZN\u2019s net income, totaling $10.4 billion, is inclusive of a pre-tax valuation loss of $2 billion in non-operating expenses associated with its investment in Rivian Automotive.The adjusted bottom-line figure was $1.13 per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36.1%.Net sales of $143.31 billion rose 13% year over year. The figure came closer to the higher end of the management\u2019s guidance of $138-$143.5 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion.Amazon witnessed a $0.2 billion impact of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Solid momentum across North America and International segments contributed well.The growing momentum of the Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) segment contributed well.Strength in the advertising business also benefited the company in the reported quarter.AWS\u2019s growing investments in generative AI are likely to continue aiding it in gaining momentum among cloud customers in the near term.Amazon\u2019s strong global presence, growing Prime momentum, improving Alexa skills, expanding smart device portfolio, and increasing efforts toward gaining strong traction among small and medium businesses are likely to drive its financial performance in the days ahead.\nProduct sales (42.5% of sales) increased 6.9% year over year to $60.9 billion. Service sales (57.5% of sales) rose 17.1% from the year-ago quarter to $82.4 billion.By segment, North America revenues (60% of sales) rose 12% from the year-ago quarter to $86.3 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $85.3 billion.International revenues (22% of sales) increased 10% year over year to $31.9 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $32.7 billion.AWS revenues (18% of sales) rose 17% year over year to $25.04 billion, which surpassed the consensus mark of $24.3 billion.Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers remained another positive. In the reported quarter, sales generated by third-party seller services rose 16% on a year-over-year basis to $34.6 billion, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.5 billion.Sales from robust advertising services increased 24% year over year to $11.8 billion, which marginally lagged the consensus mark of $11.9 billion.AMZN experienced year-over-year growth of 6% in its physical store sales, which were $5.2 billion in the reported quarter. The figure topped the consensus mark of $5.1 billion.The company\u2019s online store sales were $54.7 billion, up 7% year over year. The figure marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $54.8 billion.Strength in Prime was a positive. Amazon witnessed 11% growth in its subscription services sales, which were $10.72 billion in the reported quarter. The figure beat the consensus mark of $10.68 billion.Growing momentum with the Same-Day Delivery service worldwide was a positive. Also, the expanding original content and an international slate of content on Prime Video continued to accelerate Prime engagement.\nOperating expenses were $128.01 billion, up 4.4% from the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenues, the figure contracted 690 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 89.3%.The cost of sales, fulfillment and other operating expenses increased 7.1%, 6.8% and 2.2% year over year to $72.6 billion, $22.3 billion and $228 million, respectively.Technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses were $20.4 billion, $9.7 billion and $2.7 billion, down 0.1%, 5% and 9.9% year over year, respectively.Overall operating income was $15.3 billion compared with $4.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.Operating income for AWS was $9.4 billion, up 83.9% year over year.The North America segment reported an operating income of $4.98 billion compared with $898 million in the prior-year quarter. The International segment reported an operating income of $903 million against an operating loss of $1.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $72.9 billion, down from $73.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.Marketable securities totaled $12.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2024, down from $13.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.The long-term debt was $57.6 billion at the end of the reported quarter, down from $58.3 billion at the end of the previous quarter.In the first quarter, AMZN generated $18.99 billion of cash from operations, down from $42.5 billion in the fourth quarter.On a trailing 12-month basis, the operating cash flow came in at $99.1 billion. The free cash flow was $50.1 billion.\nFor second-quarter 2024, Amazon expects net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion. Net sales are expected to grow 7-11% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.Management projects an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 60 bps.Operating income is anticipated between $10 billion and $14 billion.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 9.18% due to these changes.\nVGM Scores\nAt this time, Amazon has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock gained ground in Wednesday's trading. The company's share price ended the daily session up 2.3%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAmazon published its first-quarter results after the market closed yesterday, reporting sales and earnings for the period that beat the average analyst estimate. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant reported earnings per share of $0.98 on sales of $143.3 billion. For comparison, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post per-share earnings of $0.83 on revenue of $142.55 billion.\nAmazon's revenue climbed 12.5% year over year in the first quarter. The company's North America segment saw an increase of 12% year over year to reach $86.3 billion. Meanwhile, sales for Amazon Web Services (AWS) rose 25% year over year to $25 billion, and international segment sales increased 10% year over year to hit $31.9 billion.\nFollowing the strong Q1 sales and earnings beats, Amazon stock rose as much as 5.8% in the daily trading session. But the tech giant's share price lost some ground as investors weighed the company's forward guidance.\nFor the second quarter, Amazon is guiding for sales to come in between $144 billion and $149 billion, suggesting growth of roughly 9% at the midpoint of the target. However, the guidance fell short of the average Wall Street analyst estimate's call for revenue of $150.09 billion in the period.\nOn the other hand, Amazon does anticipate a substantial improvement for Q2 operating income. The company is guiding for operating income to come in between $10 billion and $14 billion, improving dramatically from the $7.7 billion in operating income that it recorded in last year's quarter.\nWith artificial intelligence powering strong demand for AWS and opening the doors for dramatic efficiency improvements for the company's e-commerce business, Amazon stock looks like a smart buy on the heels of its first-quarter report. Even if second-quarter sales guidance fell short of Wall Street's target, the tech leader's long-term prospects remain very promising.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) reported first quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines, sending shares of the retail giant up around 3% in morning trading Wednesday.\nPowered by a strong showing from its cloud computing segment, Amazon continued a wave of Big Tech results that have mostly wowed Wall Street even as investors turn their focus to the conclusion of the Fed's May policy meeting on Wednesday.\nNet sales rose 13% from the same period last year to $143.3 billion, Amazon reported late Tuesday, topping analyst expectations of $142.6 billion, per Bloomberg data. The beat was driven by a 16% jump in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue, which Amazon said is on course to generate $100 billion annually.\nThe company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 versus consensus estimates of $0.83.\nLike its competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon is wielding its heft in its cloud computing business to gain an edge in the nascent AI market. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to supply vital infrastructure.\nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters following the report that overall capital expenditures are expected to \"meaningfully\" increase this year from nearly $50 billion in 2023, driven by higher infrastructure costs to support growth in AWS.\nAmazon is seeing strong demand on the AWS side, with customers signing up for longer deals with bigger commitments, many with generative AI components, he said.\nAdvertising was another strong contributor to Q1 revenue growth. The company matched analyst expectations of $11.8 billion, up 24% from the same period last year.\nEven as Amazon dazzled with growth across its businesses, its outlook flashed some signs of a potential pullback in consumer spending.\n\"What we are seeing is a bit of a continuation of what we've said in prior quarters. Customers in the US are being very thoughtful about their spend. They look for deals. They trade down,\" Olsavsky said. \"And that trend seems to be continuing into Q2.\"\nAmazon projected Q2 net sales to come in between $144 billion and $149 billion, which is slightly lower than analyst estimates of $150.2 billion, per Bloomberg data.\nAmazon's report arrived a week after its cloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft posted an impressive quarter, beating expectations on the strength of its cloud computing business. The market cheered even louder for Google parent Alphabet's results, which outperformed on the top and bottom lines and came with an announcement of a new dividend, the latest in a trend among tech giants.\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the race to claim market share and launch new consumer services. In March, Amazon increased its investment in the AI startup Anthropic, pouring in another $2.75 billion to bring its investment total to $4 billion.\nAmazon's stock, which joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) in February, is up about 20% for the year.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 1.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $189.94 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 24.2% since the start of the year compared to the 10.1% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 17.6% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 30, 2024, Amazon reported EPS of $1.13 versus consensus estimate of $0.83 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.55%.\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $4.54 per share on $638.26 billion in revenues. This represents a 56.55% change in EPS on a 11.04% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.77 per share on $709.99 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 27.08% and 11.24%, respectively.\nValuation Metrics\nAmazon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nAmazon has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 41.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 20.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 25X versus its peer group's average of 14.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.4. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Amazon shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\nHow Does AMZN Stack Up to the Competition?\nShares of AMZN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PDD Holdings Inc. (PDD). PDD has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of D.\nEarnings were strong last quarter. PDD Holdings Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 50.94%, and for the current fiscal year, PDD is expected to post earnings of $8.47 per share on revenue of $51.89 billion.\nShares of PDD Holdings Inc. have gained 13.7% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 16.26X and a P/CF of 20.57X.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AMZN and PDD, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Amazon (AMZN) Gains on Fulfillment Strength Led by Robotics",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s AMZN shares have gained 19.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Retail & Wholesale sector\u2019s return of 9%. The e-commerce giant is continuously gaining momentum in the booming online shopping space on the back of its distribution strength and expanding fulfillment network. Amazon currently has 110 fulfillment centers in the United States and 185 such facilities globally.The company\u2019s deepening focus toward aiding automation at its fulfillment centers on the back of Amazon Robotics remains noteworthy.To maintain its dominant position in the e-commerce market, Amazon needs to continue investing more in fulfillment centers in the United States and the international regions.In this regard, the company recently inaugurated a robotics fulfillment center called YYC4 in Canada, located in Calgary, Alberta.This facility, spanning 2.8 million square feet, is designed to improve the work efficiency and safety of workers through automated systems and robots. YYC4 is equipped with RWC4 robotics technology, which aids in sorting totes and constructing pallets for shipping. Amazon has also deployed a trolley called Kermit that transports empty totes.The company strives to offer in-demand skill training, create job opportunities and fulfill customer orders as fast as possible with the help of advanced robotics technology.With the launch of YYC4, Amazon has expanded its presence in Canada. It now has five fulfillment centers, one sortation center, three delivery stations and two AMXL delivery stations in Alberta.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nRobotics that utilize AI and ML techniques are becoming mainstream in the retail industry. Per a report from Maximize Research Report, the global market for retail robotics is expected to witness a CAGR of 32.5% between 2023 and 2029.Amazon remains well-poised to capitalize on this growth prospect on the back of its increasing number of robotics fulfillment centers worldwide.Per the first-quarter 2024 earnings release, the company operates robotics fulfillment centers in 11 countries, and they help improve workplace ergonomics, and reduce heavy lifting and repetitive tasks.Amazon intends to open such facilities in Asturias, Spain and Sagamihara City, Japan.The company\u2019s concerted efforts in advancements of its retail and fulfillment robots are other positives.Amazon\u2019s introduction of a mobile robot, namely Titan, which is designed for lifting up to 2,500 pounds in its fulfillment centers, is noteworthy. The company\u2019s robotics technology also includes Sequoia, which helps identify and store inventory received at the fulfillment centers up to 75% faster than humans. This way, it helps increase the number of goods delivered the same day or next day.Growing fulfillment robotics strength is expected to aid Amazon in driving its customer momentum in the e-commerce space. This, in turn, will drive growth in its online store sales, which stood at $54.7 billion in first-quarter 2024, up 7% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same metric for 2024 is pegged at $244.8 billion, indicating growth of 5.6% from the 2023 reported level.Strengthening online store sales will, in turn, aid Amazon\u2019s overall financial performance.The consensus mark for 2024 sales is projected at $638.24 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $4.58 per share, suggesting year-over-year growth of 57.9%. The estimate has been revised upward 11.7% over the past 30 days.In regard to competition, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, with its expanding robotics capabilities, has intensified the battle for Walmart WMT, which is trying to narrow down its gap from Amazon in the e-commerce category.Walmart\u2019s growing deployment of moving shelf-scanning robots, which are capable of detecting any shelving error across its stores in the United States, remains noteworthy. The company is also accelerating the use of automation across its supply chain.\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the retail-wholesale sector are The Gap GPS and Coupang CPNG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Gap has gained 2.8% in the year-to-date period. GPS's long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 12%.Coupang shares have gained 73.2% in the year-to-date period.

        "Text": "Amazon shareholders have plenty to cheer about these days thanks to a stock price that is up by more than one-fifth already in 2024. The news got even better earlier this week when Amazon breezed past first-quarter earnings expectations, pushing the stock close to its record high. Given Amazon\u2019s dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing, it\u2019s no wonder the company attracts some of the top names in investing.\nTrending Now: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nLearn More: 4 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nOn April 11, 2024, Amazon shares hit a new all-time high and closed the day at $189.05, Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported. The stock hit a mini-slump after that, but rebounded this week when Amazon posted first-quarter earnings of 98 cents a share. That was more than triple the prior year\u2019s earnings and well above analyst estimates for 83 cents, CNBC reported.\nIt\u2019s fair to say Amazon didn\u2019t need a blowout quarter to attract leading investors \u2014 it\u2019s been doing that almost since Jeff Bezos launched the company as an online bookseller nearly three decades ago. Amazon\u2019s meteoric rise since then has made Bezos one of the world\u2019s richest people, with a net worth of more than $190 billion.\nIt helps that the company attracts some heavy hitters in the investment industry.

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Amazon on Wednesday slashed layers of middle management in some of its customer service divisions as part of an organizational restructuring, Fortune has learned.\nThe cuts affected more than 100 customer service managers working in Level 5 and Level 6 middle management positions both in call centers and virtually. Impacted employees worked mainly in either the U.S. or India. Some of the managers first realized something was up when their computer systems suddenly shut down during their workday, according to one source.\n\"We have had more and more work added, 12-16 hour days, maximum stress to be cut free without a thought or a warning,\" one of those impacted by the cuts told Fortune.\nAn Amazon spokesperson said that the restructuring was intended in part to shrink the distance between customers and customer service leaders. The layoffs impacted less than 1 percent of the global Amazon customer service workforce, the company said, but it was unclear what percentage of the customer service division's management team was impacted.\n\u201cAs part of a shift in how our Worldwide Customer Service organization is structured, we\u2019ve identified a relatively small number of roles that are no longer required,\" Amazon spokesperson Montana MacLachlan said in a statement. \"We did not make these decisions lightly, and we are committed to supporting employees whose roles are affected during their transition.\"\nThe affected US employees will receive pay and benefits for 60 days plus severance, the company said.\nThe layoffs come two weeks after Amazon posted strong first-quarter financial results with more than $143 billion in revenue and $10 billion in profit. Amazon under CEO Andy Jassy has finally hit an inflection point where it can both invest heavily in long-term bets like generative AI while at the same time pumping out needle-moving profits. The company has reached this point, in part, due to Jassy's willingness to oversee the largest corporate layoffs in Amazon's history in recent years and demand that his leaders continually squeeze out excess costs wherever possible. Amazon divisions such as AWS, Prime Video, and Twitch have all cut hundreds of employees this year.\nAmazon has also worked this year to shift major logistics costs from its own books to those of third-party merchants in the form of new, controversial seller fees.\n\"[W]e don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side,\" Jassy told Wall Street analysts during its earnings call last month.\nNews of the customer service layoffs first surfaced in a LinkedIn post written by a former Amazon general manager named Tony Carr.\nAre you an Amazon manager impacted by these layoffs or an Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Title": "Atlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Atlas Air will stop flying freighter aircraft in Amazon\u2019s domestic parcel network by the middle of next year and concentrate on international widebody service for its growing customer base, which will soon include Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu, CEO Michael Steen said in an interview.\nBoth parties have agreed to terminate contracts under which Atlas provides crews, routine maintenance and insurance (CMI) for 25 converted freighters: eight Boeing 737-800s and 17 Boeing 767-300s. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is responsible for providing the aircraft. The contracts were to expire in March 2026.\nAt the same time, privately held Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and the e-commerce giant have agreed to extend for three years the leases on 16 B767s operated by Atlas Air, Steen said. The aircraft are owned by Atlas\u2019 leasing subsidiary, Titan Aviation, and were originally leased to Amazon for 10 years. The e-tailer, which separately hired Atlas to fly the aircraft, will be free to transfer the aircraft to another operator that signs a CMI contract.\nTitan leases 19 total 767 aircraft to Amazon, including two that are operated by rival Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG). The three aircraft that weren\u2019t extended have extension options.\nAmazon directly controls the eight 737-800s, which are leased from AerCap and could also be placed with another cargo airline.\nSteen said Atlas Air will reallocate resources to intercontinental operations, where the potential for profits is greater. Toward that end, the airline is adding eight widebody freighters in 2024.\nTwo 777 production freighters ordered from Boeing last year are scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter for an undisclosed customer. Ocean shipping giant CMA CGM recently announced that its startup airline has struck a CMI agreement with Atlas Air to operate two Boeing 777 freighters on trans-Pacific routes, starting in the coming months. And Atlas Air recently acquired four previously owned Boeing 747-400 cargo jets that will join the fleet in the third quarter, two of which will be dedicated to Shein and Temu.\n\u201cSo strategically, as we think about the return on investment on the assets that we\u2019re deploying, we are definitely going for the larger widebody aircraft and the intercontinental market where growth is the strongest,\u201d Steen told FreightWaves.\nAtlas Air currently operates or leases 112 aircraft, including 48 B747-400s, 10 B747-8s, seven B777-200s, with the fleet reaching 120 aircraft by year\u2019s end. Sister airline Polar Air Cargo operates nine widebody jets.\nWhile the market is oversaturated with narrowbody regional freighters, the future is bright for operators of long-haul cargo jets, the CEO declared. Atlas Air currently occupies more than 10% of the global widebody freighter fleet and is well positioned to take advantage of growing demand for industrial goods and electronics, as well as a surge in e-commerce shipments.\nSteen pointed to forecasts for compound annual growth rates of 3.5% to 4.5% versus 1% growth in capacity across the industry and a large retirement wave for aging freighters as reasons for investing in large freighters such as the 747 and 777. He has previously said that about 20% of the global fleet of 650 widebody freighters are older than 30 years and nearing retirement.\nStructural changes in the passenger sector are also driving the need for more dedicated freighters. About 60% of global air cargo volume moves on all-cargo aircraft and 40% rides in passenger bellies, but according to a study by McKinsey, only 47% of intercontinental belly hold capacity is usable for airfreight because airlines post-COVID have changed cabin interiors to accommodate more premium-class seating, driving passengers to carry more luggage and reducing space for containers. Meanwhile, airlines are also reorienting networks to serve more leisure destinations where cargo demand is limited.\nThe boom in shipments from e-commerce platforms and fast-fashion companies in China has become a driving force behind the air cargo market\u2019s recovery and shows no sign of slowing down. E-commerce represented about 19% of global retail sales in 2023 and is on track to capture 41% of the market by 2027, according to Boston Consulting Group.\nShein will be the second fast-fashion retailer to sign a long-term dedicated charter agreement with Atlas Air, following Spain-based Inditex. The new breed of fashion houses constantly introduce huge amounts of new products on their websites with very short inventory turnover time, making it important to quickly deliver orders to customers and stores before trends change. Atlas Air already operates dedicated freighters around the world for Alibaba\u2019s logistics arm, while several freight forwarders and Mediterranean Shipping Co.\u2019s new cargo airline use time-chartered aircraft to support their e-commerce customers.\n\u201cTheir volumes are so large that they need dedicated freighters,\u201d said Steen. \u201cWe are their flying warehouse, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\nShein and Temu already use Atlas Air for short-term charters, but they will have full control of aircraft starting in the third quarter.\nAtlas Air is the largest operator of 747 freighters in the world and added to its lead with the four used 747-400s. Two of the cargo jets were acquired from Silkway West Airlines in Azerbaijan. Two former China Airlines aircraft were picked up from U.S. trader Jetran, as previously reported by trade publication Cargo Facts.\nNippon Cargo Airlines last week renewed an agreement with Atlas to operate five of NCA\u2019s 747-400 freighters between Asia and North America amid growing demand. And YunExpress, a freight forwarder in China, in March signed a long-term charter agreement with Atlas for use of a second Boeing 777-200 freighter.\nThe phaseout of flying for Amazon will also free up five 767s previously maintained as spares to operate full time for Atlas customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, Steen said. The company plans to soon place some of the medium-widebody freighters with new customers that have signed long-term package leases, which include an aircraft, along with the crew, maintenance and insurance.\nSteen dismissed suggestions the airline will shrink its pilot cohort because of the lost Amazon business, noting that it needs about 250 pilots and staff to support the eight large freighters and the incremental increase in 767 flying. He told employees during a company town hall earlier this week that there are no plans to furlough pilots who choose to stay, according to accounts of the meeting posted in pilot chat rooms.\n\u201cWhen we look at reports that a lot of pilots are going to be without a seat, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d the Atlas chief said.\nThe change in Atlas\u2019 partnership with Amazon makes it clear that at least a portion of the 767 fleet will be placed with ABX Air, one of two cargo airlines owned by Air Transport Services Group. In early May, ATSG announced that Amazon will provide 10 additional 767-300 freighters to operate on its behalf under a five-year contract and that ABX will begin flying them in June. ATSG did not say from where Amazon would obtain the aircraft, all of which are expected to be delivered by Dec. 1.\nAmazon has the right to place up to 10 more aircraft with ABX, which currently operates four B767-200s for Amazon. Sister airline Air Transport International operates more than 40 767s on Amazon\u2019s behalf.\nAmazon owns nearly 20% of ATSG. It previously owned a stake in Atlas Air, but the shares were bought out by the new ownership group. Amazon also dry leases two 767-300s from Titan Aviation that are operated by ATSG carriers.\nAmazon\u2019s other providers of outsourced air cargo service in the United States are Sun Country Airlines, which operates 737-800s, and Hawaiian Airlines, with two Airbus A330-300 converted freighters.\nSteen declined to provide specifics about the breakup with Amazon over the dedicated transportation agreements, which give Amazon the option to terminate with 180 days of written notice for circumstances such as a change of ownership or performance issues. Penalty clauses can apply to either party for early termination but are likely subject to negotiation. Atlas Air was taken private in early 2023 by a consortium of investors led by Apollo Global Management.\nAmazon media representatives didn\u2019t respond to inquiries about changes to the company\u2019s air network. One analyst familiar with airlines that provide outsourced airlift for express delivery companies, who requested anonymity so as not to jeopardize business relationships, expressed skepticism that Atlas would voluntarily give up domestic flying to concentrate on widebody operations while acknowledging new ownership could value the return on investment differently.\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\u00a0\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\nYunExpress charters Atlas Air freighters for US e-commerce service\nThe post Atlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com's cloud services unit said on Tuesday that it has not halted any orders of Nvidia's most advanced chip on the market, but has instead decided to purchase the company's newer state of the art chip for an upcoming supercomputer project between the companies.\nEarlier, the Financial Times had reported that Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest cloud services firm, had \"fully transitioned\" its previous orders for Nvidia's Grace Hopper chip to its newer Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs), that Nvidia announced in March.\nAn AWS spokesman told Reuters that the transition from Grace Hopper chips to Blackwell chips applies only to Project Ceiba, a supercomputer that AWS and Nvidia are building together. AWS continues to offer other services based on Nvidia's Hopper chips, its flagship model for training artificial intelligence systems (AI), the spokesman said.\nThe Project Ceiba transition was announced by the two firms in March when Nvidia unveiled the new Blackwell chips.\n\"To be clear, AWS did not halt any orders from Nvidia. In our close collaboration with Nvidia, we jointly decided to move Project Ceiba from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs, which offer a leap forward in performance,\" an AWS spokesman said in statement.\nThe Financial Times amended its earlier story to say that Amazon's chip orders had not yet been placed.

        "Author": " Hamza Shaban    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is beefing up its food delivery perk through its Prime service, expanding a business partnership with Grubhub and bolstering its offerings as merchants and retailers increasingly compete for subscription revenue and bundled services.\nPrime members will now get free access to Grubhub+, a $120-a-year subscription service that includes free deliveries on eligible orders and lower service fees. Amazon customers and Prime members can also start ordering from Grubhub directly on Amazon's website and app, the company announced late Wednesday.\nThe Grubhub benefit bolsters Amazon's food offerings, which operate on multiple prongs. They include Amazon\u2019s traditional network, which delivers nonperishable foods; grocery delivery through Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods, and other retailers; and, with Grubhub, takeout. During Amazon's latest earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said both the nonperishable and grocery businesses were growing.\n\"Amazon already offers a lot of value, but it needs to keep pushing the envelope as more retailers develop their own loyalty and membership programs,\" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData. \"It is also a way of making Amazon a one-stop shop for food needs.\"\nThe Grubhub perk, which solidifies and expands on a previous trial offer, underscores Amazon's efforts to shape Prime into an all-encompassing membership program.\n\"Prime is all about convenience, savings, entertainment, increasingly health, and with Grubhub, we are deepening the partnership to really stand for food delivery as well, and really round out, in one simple membership, all the needs and wants of busy households across the United States,\" Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.\nGhani declined to comment on the possibility of Amazon acquiring Grubhub. The original partnership announcement between Amazon and Grubhub in 2022 included the option for Amazon to exercise warrants for a 2% stake in Grubhub as well as additional warrants exercisable for up to another 13%.\n\"I don\u2019t think a takeover is on the cards right now, although it may be of interest in the future,\" Saunders said. \"Amazon is currently in the mindset of driving efficiencies across the business rather than doing big deals. Amazon would also need to be convinced that it could add value to Grubhub or parent company Just Eat in order to do a deal.\"\nGhani said the company sees the Grubhub deal as part of Prime's progression in value. What started in 2005 as an untested free shipping service has grown into an e-commerce juggernaut. Membership benefits have expanded to streaming and music, medical services, Thursday Night Football, and takeout.\nPreviously, Amazon gave Prime members a one-year Grubhub+ trial that converted to a paid membership. In the new arrangement, Prime members only need to activate the ongoing Grubhub+ offer to receive the free, ongoing benefit.\nFor Grubhub, which is owned by Just Eat Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), Saunders said the partnership is a way to expand memberships, which helps it earn more commissions from restaurants.\nShares of Just Eat are down almost 14% for the year, lagging competitors DoorDash (DASH) and Uber (UBER), whose stock prices are up 16% and 11%, respectively. While customers flocked to food delivery businesses during the height of the pandemic, the business model continues to face questions about sustainable profitability.\nAmazon shares have gained more than 20% for the year, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite's (^IXIC) 15% rise.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "Did Amazon Just Say \"Checkmate\" to Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Much of the ongoing discussion on artificial intelligence (AI) revolves around the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Over the past 18 months, big tech has made a series of headline-grabbing, billion-dollar investments in AI initiatives.\nAmong leading enterprises in the Magnificent Seven are Nvidia\u00a0and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). While Nvidia seems to have a strong pulse across all facets of the AI arena, I wouldn't over appreciate the company's dominance.\nLet's dig into what is driving Nvidia's growth right now, and explore how Amazon may leapfrog the company in the long run.\nNvidia designs sophisticated semiconductor chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs have all sorts of applications ranging from training large language models, machine learning, autonomous driving, and more.\nBeyond the tech sector, generative AI has use cases in healthcare as well. Nvidia's GPUs are even being used by leading pharmaceutical companies such as Novo Nordisk -- the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy.\nUnsurprisingly, Nvidia's prolific reach has helped the company amass a staggering 80% share of the AI chip market.\nWhile it may seem as if Nvidia's lead is insurmountable, keep in mind that the AI revolution is still in its early stages. Although Amazon might look behind, I'd argue that the company is merely pacing itself and preparing for a marathon-style race.\nThe AI startup scene is absolutely packed. One of the more notable players is a machine learning company called Hugging Face, a unicorn that boasts Salesforce, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and IBM as investors.\nDo you notice anything from that investor syndicate? Many of them are either chip companies or cloud computing specialists.\nConveniently, Amazon is both. In addition to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon is developing a line of training and inferencing chips. Aptly named Trainium and Inferentia, these chips are igniting new sources of growth for AWS as cloud computing becomes evermore competitive.\nMoreover, Hugging Face recently announced that it is partnering with AWS to deploy workloads on the newest version of Inferentia. I see this as a big win for Amazon, and it ultimately serves as stepping stone for the company to migrate away from a reliance on Nvidia products in the long run.\nAnother way Amazon is starting to build some momentum is from its $4 billion investment in another AI startup, Anthropic. Like Hugging Face, Anthropic is training its generative AI models on Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips and is also using AWS as its primary cloud provider.\nIf this weren't enough to depict Amazon as a serious contender in the AI realm, consider the company's planned $11 billion investment to build data centers. While Nvidia also competes in the data center space, companies such as Amazon and Oracle have their own plans.\nRight now, Amazon stock trades for roughly $179 per share. This is quite close to the company's all-time high of $189.\nWith that in mind, you might think Amazon stock is expensive. However, the chart below indicates something different.\nOver the past 12 months, Amazon's share price has risen by roughly 50%. By contrast, the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) has increased by 181%.\nSince the company's earnings growth is accelerating more than the share price, Amazon's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple actually declines year over year. This means that even though the share price is touching all-time highs, Amazon is technically cheaper today than it was just last year.\nI think Amazon is underappreciated when it comes to AI. The company is investing aggressive sums and is already igniting some newfound momentum. Over time, I suspect that the moves the company is making today will pay off in spades and provide Amazon with a layer of flexibility over the competition.\nTo me, Amazon stock is dirt cheap and represents a compelling long-term opportunity in the AI space. While Nvidia will probably remain the posterchild of AI in the near-term, I think Amazon is making some savvy chess moves that will ultimately set it up as a superior long-term position.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Companies from Microsoft Corp. to Apple Inc. are also growing in the Southeast Asian market of more than 650 million people, partly to diversify away from China and reduce geopolitical risks amid tensions between Beijing and Washington.\nIncluding the Singapore investment, AWS has this year announced plans to spend about $35 billion outside the US, including in Japan, Saudi Arabia and Mexico. The company is also setting up clusters of data centers in Malaysia and Thailand.\nAmazon last month said AWS was on track to bring in more than $100 billion in sales over the course of a year for the first time. Amazon executives say AWS is benefiting from corporate technology modernization projects as well as demand for AI services.\nThe announcement came as part of an AWS ASEAN Summit in Singapore, where AI took center stage with a series of initiatives from the US company. The city-state was the first data center region AWS established in Asia.\n\u201cThis investment will create a ripple effect across Singapore by increasing economic growth and cloud adoption,\u201d said AWS country manager Priscilla Chong.\nAmazon estimates that its planned investment will support an average of 12,300 full-time equivalent jobs in local Singapore businesses each year. The company will also conduct workshops for more than 100 businesses in two years, partnering with the Singapore government to help small businesses leverage generative AI.\nSingapore has grown into a hub for US businesses in Asia, such as Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc., and is seen as a gateway to the broader Southeast Asia region, which is expected to grow at a rapid clip.\nMicrosoft, Amazon\u2019s biggest rival in cloud services, did a tour of local economies last week, with Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella announcing a series of new investments and initiatives for Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\n(Updates with comment from executive in seventh paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags\nTim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "Text": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 30, 2024\nAmazon.com, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.978, expectations were $0.82.\nOperator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a presentation, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\nDave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\nAndy Jassy: Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making. Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want.\nFor instance, in the US, we recently welcomed Clinique and two Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our GenAI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment.\nAs our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the US. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest US metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about three out of four items were delivered the same or next day.\nFaster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped to lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience. One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes.\nAs we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our cost. When we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact. Another prominent example is our efforts to revamp our US inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans. Advertising performance remained strong with ad sales up 24% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nThe strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we're just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It's very early for streaming TV ads but we're encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.\nAnd given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere. We're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure.\nAnd with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging gen AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already. You heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities at all three layers of the Gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon, training, and inference is quite high, given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives.\nLarger quantities of our latest generation, Trainium 2 is coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025. Companies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker, our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster than SageMaker, Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under seven months using SageMaker. This change is how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker.\nThe middle layer of the stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch, but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model, or LLM, customize it with their own data, and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure high-quality, low-latency, cost-effective production Gen AI apps. This is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand model's knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models. Bedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including Adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair, and Toyota.\nIn the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best-performing models in the planet right now; Meta's Llama 3 models; Mistral's Various models, Cohere's newest models, and new first-party Amazon Titan models. A week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a sneaky big launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met. As increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality production-grade Gen AI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their applications.\nCustomers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these two linchpins services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing. The top of the stack are the Gen AI applications being built. And today, we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and leveraging company's internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code, it also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones.\nIn the near future, Q will help developers transform their dotNET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. Q also has a unique capability called Agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, everything from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature such as asking it to create an add to favorites feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files and suggested new functions. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan, and then the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across multiple files, code blocks and test suites.\nIt's quite handy. On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, Internet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3 and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories. And it will search all this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, engage in dialogue with customers about this data. We also introduced today a powerful new capability called Q Apps, which lets employees describe a natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data and Q Apps will quickly generate that app.\nThis is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data. Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data, but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors and catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, Bridge Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slam, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q, and we've only been in beta until today.\nI'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these gen AI services. It's less sexy, but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening in the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS. We expect the combination of AWS' reaccelerating growth and high demand for gen AI to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which given the way the AWS business model works is a positive sign of the future growth.\nThe more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way. We remain very bullish on AWS. We're at $100 billion-plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And this is before you even calculate gen AI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There is a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments.\nOur emerging international stores are growing and moving towards profitability. Our third-party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon shipping and multichannel fulfillment continues to grow well. We just launched a Prime delivery grocery benefit that lets customers receive free unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year in Manhattan, we're launching a new smaller Whole Foods market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop. Prime Video continues to produce compelling content with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of a very successful Roadhouse movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content.\nOur health services business is growing robustly as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in eight cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year with customers now getting first fill medications 75% faster year-over-year nationwide. And Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial data. There's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity. I'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\nBrian Olsavsky: Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple of points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate. Second, while I typically talk about growth rates, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the US dollar, more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million or 50 basis point headwind to revenue relative to what we guided.\nExcluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by strong operational performance across all three reportable segments and better-than-expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the international segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nWe remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers: selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we help customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third-party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third-party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year-over-year.\nOperating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates. In our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements and improved volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability.\nLooking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improved profitability in our worldwide stores business while still investing to improve the customer experience. Within our fulfillment network, we are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place and we like the path we're on. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads.\nMoving to AWS. Revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries as companies are shifting their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Additionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish. While there always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts.\nAWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage. As we've said in the past, over time, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases.\nIn 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals, making bigger commitments. Still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q2. Net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion or to grow between 7% and 11%, compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter.\nOur Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe, where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the US. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way.\nWith that, let's move on to your questions.\nSee also\n20 Biggest Natural Gas Companies in Australia, 2024 and\n13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n"

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) had a rough 2022 as rising inflation weighed on earnings, so last year the company revamped its cost structure to turn things around. And now this year, the market giant is showing investors they still can count on it for major growth. In the latest earnings report, sales increased in the double digits, and net income more than tripled.\nThis is thanks to Amazon's moves to boost efficiency and its ongoing dominance in the high-growth markets of e-commerce and cloud computing. And speaking of the cloud, this is where we'll find the company's biggest victory of the quarter. Gains here are significant because Amazon Web Services (AWS) generally is Amazon's profit driver -- so top performance by AWS should translate into stronger profitability for the company.\nLet's check out this massive news for shareholders that Amazon delivered (excuse the pun) during its most recent earnings report...\nFirst, a quick summary of Amazon's earnings track record. The company has grown sales and net profit into the billions of dollars over time, and it even doubled its fulfillment network in earlier stages of the pandemic due to overwhelming e-commerce demand. In more recent times, higher inflation hurt the wallets of consumers and budgets of businesses, resulting in weakness in Amazon's e-commerce and cloud sales.\nBut Amazon made a few key moves that set the company up for growth as the economic situation improved. Amazon revised its cost structure to favor efficiency and even shifted its U.S. fulfillment model from a national one to a regional one -- bringing inventory closer to the consumer. This particular decision already has started lowering Amazon's cost to serve, and the company says it's far from done when it comes to streamlining processes.\nDuring tough economic times, Amazon directed AWS customers to options that helped them stay within their budgets -- even though this meant lower revenue for AWS in the near term, it kept these customers coming back. And today AWS is benefiting as many customers have emerged from the cost-cutting mode and now are deploying new projects.\nFinally, Amazon put its investment focus on cloud computing, ramping up infrastructure as well as its presence in the hot field of artificial intelligence (AI). AWS is going all in on AI, offering customers everything they need for their projects: from compute for those building their own large language models (LLMs) to a fully managed service that offers customers access to top LLMs to customize. And Amazon also offers customers a variety of AI-powered apps across its businesses -- from a shopping assistant on the e-commerce platform to a coding assistant through AWS.\nNow, let's get to the massive news Amazon reported late last month. To put this into context, it's important to remember that as recently as the second quarter of last year, AWS reported a decline in operating income. Yet, in the most recent quarter, AWS' net sales rose 17% and operating income soared 84%. And the big news is AWS, reporting $25 billion in sales for the quarter, achieved a $100 billion annual revenue run rate.\nThis is massive news for investors because it shows Amazon's investments in AI and technology infrastructure are paying off -- and considering AWS' role in Amazon's overall profitability, this bodes well for the company's profit moving forward. Why? Because we're just at the start of the potential AI revolution.\nThe AI market, growing at a double-digit compound annual growth rate, is forecast to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. AWS is the world's leading cloud provider, so it's well positioned to benefit from demand for AI products and services -- especially since it's well prepared, offering customers so many options from budget to premium.\nWhat does this mean for investors? That even at 41x forward earnings estimates, Amazon shares are reasonably priced today, so worth a buy -- and if you're already a shareholder, you're likely to gain by holding on as the AI story develops.\nAmazon has a solid growth track record, built as its e-commerce and cloud businesses took off, but this big tech and consumer stock hasn't reached the late stages of its growth story. The company's monetization of AI is just beginning, and this along with its ongoing dominance in e-commerce and cloud services make Amazon a top growth stock to own for the long haul.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Matt Day ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s newly named cloud chief, Matt Garman, inherits a $100-billion-a-year business that\u2019s as profitable as it has ever been. He also faces the daunting task of retaining the cloud-computing pioneer\u2019s edge in the artificial intelligence age.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site\nEbrahim Raisi, Iranian President Confronting West, Dies at 63\nSpeedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge\nSaudi Crown Prince Postpones Japan Trip Over King\u2019s Health\nChina\u2019s Housing Rescue Too Small to End Crisis, Analysts Say\nA longtime Amazon Web Services engineering leader who was most recently sales chief, Garman, 48, will assume one of the most prominent positions in the technology industry when he succeeds Adam Selipsky next month.\nSelipsky, who has led AWS since 2021, will relinquish the role on June 3 \u201cto move onto his next challenge,\u201d Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday.\nThe cloud unit, the world\u2019s largest seller of rented computing power and data storage, has long accounted for most of Amazon\u2019s operating income, serving as a cash machine that gives the parent company flexibility to make big investments in other areas.\nBut AWS struggled in the last two years when businesses trimmed their technology spending following pandemic-era splurges. The cloud unit\u2019s growth slowed to a record low last year, which executives attributed in part to Amazon\u2019s own efforts to help customers save money. The unit held its largest-ever layoffs a year ago and has continued trimming since, even as it continues to hire for specific areas.\nThe division also stumbled out of the gate in the race to commercialize a new generation of artificial intelligence services, lagging behind rivals Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google in bringing to market the systems that power such products as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nEarly versions of AWS\u2019s AI products were deemed insufficient by some customers. Since then, the company has invested $4 billion in Anthropic, a well-regarded builder of generative AI tools. AWS is also building its own tools to rival ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers.\nSo while Microsoft and Google are widely seen as leaders in generative AI \u2014 which responds to users\u2019 prompts with newly created text, voice or images \u2014 Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related business for years to come.\n\u201cRegardless of how much or how little Adam Selipsky is responsible for AWS\u2019s progression in AI, as CEO, he owns the outcome,\u201d said Corey Quinn, the chief cloud economist at the Duckbill Group, a consulting firm that advises AWS clients. \u201cAnd the outcome has not been terrific.\u201d\nSelipsky, 57, said in a note to employees that he would \u201ctake the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities.\u201d A spokesperson for AWS declined to comment beyond the executives\u2019 memos.\nSelipsky was Jassy\u2019s right hand during the cloud group\u2019s early years, serving in a chief operating officer-like capacity that saw him lead sales, marketing and other roles. He left in 2016 to run Tableau, a Seattle builder of data visualization tools later sold to Salesforce Inc., before returning three years ago. His second stint at Amazon was a surprise to many AWS employees who had expected the job to go to Garman.\nGarman interned at Amazon in 2005 while still in business school at Northwestern University, and joined full-time the following year, helping to launch some of the first AWS products. He went on to run engineering teams working on Amazon\u2019s on-demand computing power services, and began leading AWS\u2019s sales and marketing teams in 2020, a sign to close watchers of the company that he was being groomed for the top job.\nPracticed Humility\nPeople who\u2019ve worked with Garman describe him as a detail-oriented engineering manager in the Amazon mold, brimming with self-confidence and a practiced humility when dealing with customers or entering new markets. Like many of Amazon\u2019s senior executives, he\u2019s not considered a polished public speaker or gladhander. Garman doesn\u2019t shy away from confrontation, challenging the assumptions of product teams in meetings and drilling down on specific data points.\n\u201cMatt has an unusually strong set of skills and experiences for his new role,\u201d said Jassy, who led AWS from its inception in the early 2000s until he was named to Amazon\u2019s top job in 2021. \u201cHe\u2019s very customer focused, a terrific product leader, inventive, a clever problem-solver, right a lot, has high standards and meaningful bias for action.\u201d\nGarman said he\u2019ll announce organizational changes in the coming weeks. One arrived on Tuesday: Amazon\u2019s sustainability teams, which had reported to Selipsky, will move to communications chief Drew Herdener\u2019s organization.\nShortly after he started at AWS, Garman was asked by a business school pal who worked in another Amazon unit how things were going at AWS, which at the time was a counterintuitive bet by an online retailer. Garman replied that he thought AWS would someday be a $1 billion business. His friend scoffed, Garman told Bloomberg in 2019.\nBy the time AWS publicly disclosed its sales almost a decade after that conversation, AWS was on track for almost $8 billion in annual sales.\n\u201cWe thought it would take a lot longer,\u201d Garman said.\n(Updates with background throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

The agreement is the extension of the latter\u2019s cloud technology collaboration with AWS.This highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.Per the agreement, AWS has become the strategic cloud provider of insurance company FWD. In order to support its cloud-first strategy, FWD intends to leverage AWS\u2019s cloud computing capabilities, agility and scalability.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nThe latest move of FWD has added strength to AWS\u2019s customer base.AWS\u2019s concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.Recently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter\u2019s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.CrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CrowdStrike aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.In addition, Brightcove started using Amazon\u2019s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media, and entertainment technology sectors.BlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cyber security operations.Zilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter\u2019s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\nWe believe that AWS\u2019s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.The strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.AMZN has gained 20.3% year to date.\nWe believe that AWS\u2019s growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.Microsoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n(NOTE: This article is being reissued to correct an error.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc showcases a robust increase in net income from $3,172 million in Q1 2023 to $10,431 million in Q1 2024.\nOperating income sees a significant jump, indicating improved operational efficiency and cost management.\nDespite global economic challenges, Amazon.com Inc continues to expand its market presence and enhance its service offerings.\nAmazon.com Inc's strategic investments in technology and infrastructure signal a forward-looking approach to growth and customer satisfaction.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), a global leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, has released its 10-Q filing on May 1, 2024, revealing a comprehensive financial performance for the first quarter of the year. The company has demonstrated a remarkable increase in net income, soaring from $3,172 million in Q1 2023 to $10,431 million in Q1 2024. This financial prowess is further underscored by a substantial rise in operating income, which has escalated from $4,774 million to $15,307 million in the same period. These figures reflect Amazon.com Inc's adeptness in navigating the complex market dynamics and its commitment to operational excellence. With a diversified portfolio that spans across North America, International, and AWS segments, the company continues to solidify its market position while exploring new horizons for growth and innovation.\nFinancial Performance and Market Leadership: Amazon.com Inc's financial health is a testament to its market leadership and operational efficiency. The company's net income has more than tripled from Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, indicating robust profitability and a strong return on investments. This financial strength is supported by a diverse revenue stream, with significant contributions from North America, International, and AWS segments. Amazon's ability to maintain a leading position in e-commerce, coupled with its dominance in cloud computing through AWS, provides a competitive edge that is difficult for rivals to match. The company's brand recognition and customer loyalty further reinforce its market dominance, making it a formidable force in the industry.\nInnovation and Infrastructure: Amazon.com Inc's commitment to innovation is evident in its continued investment in technology and infrastructure. The company's Q1 2024 report highlights a slight decrease in technology and infrastructure expenses, suggesting improved cost management and operational efficiencies. Amazon's forward-thinking approach to investing in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, positions it well for future growth. Moreover, the company's expansive fulfillment network and data centers are key to its ability to scale operations and meet the growing demand for its services, both from consumers and AWS clients.\nDependence on Economic Conditions: Despite its strong financial performance, Amazon.com Inc is not immune to the macroeconomic factors that can impact consumer spending and operational costs. The company acknowledges the influence of inflation, interest rates, and global economic developments on its operations. These external factors can lead to fluctuations in customer demand, affecting Amazon's sales and profitability. Additionally, the company's international operations expose it to currency exchange risks, which can affect its financial results, as seen in the $164 million reduction in net sales due to foreign exchange rates in Q1 2024.\nIntense Competition: Amazon.com Inc operates in highly competitive markets, facing challenges from both established players and emerging startups. The company's expansion into new products, services, and geographic regions brings additional risks, including the need to adapt to local market conditions and regulatory environments. Competitors with greater resources or more aggressive pricing strategies could potentially erode Amazon's market share. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of technology and consumer preferences requires continuous innovation and investment, which can strain the company's resources and affect its long-term sustainability.\nGlobal Expansion: Amazon.com Inc's international segment has shown a 10% increase in sales in Q1 2024, signaling opportunities for further global expansion. By leveraging its brand and operational expertise, Amazon can tap into emerging markets and broaden its customer base. The company's focus on price, selection, and convenience, along with its fast shipping offers, positions it well to capture additional market share internationally. Strategic partnerships and localized offerings could enhance Amazon's presence in key markets and drive future growth.\nService Diversification: The AWS segment's 17% sales increase in Q1 2024 highlights the potential for service diversification. Amazon.com Inc can continue to build on its cloud computing services, offering innovative solutions to start-ups, enterprises, and government agencies. The company's ability to adapt to customer needs and pricing changes, as well as its investment in technology infrastructure, supports the expansion of AWS and other service offerings. Diversifying into areas such as healthcare services, licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services can create new revenue streams and reduce reliance on traditional retail sales.\nRegulatory and Legal Challenges: Amazon.com Inc faces a complex regulatory landscape that can pose significant threats to its operations. The company is subject to various laws and regulations related to e-commerce, data protection, consumer rights, and international trade. Changes in these regulations or unfavorable legal outcomes can lead to increased compliance costs, operational restrictions, and potential fines. Additionally, Amazon's vast third-party seller platform exposes it to risks associated with fraudulent activities and counterfeit goods, which can harm its reputation and result in legal liabilities.\nMarket Volatility and Consumer Behavior: The variability in Amazon.com Inc's retail business, driven by seasonality, promotions, and unforeseeable events, places strain on its operations. The company must navigate the challenges of stocking appropriate inventory levels, managing shipping costs, and ensuring timely delivery to meet fluctuating customer demand. Market volatility, including changes in interest rates and economic conditions,\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Five years after Amazon.com Inc. raised wages to $15 an hour, half of warehouse workers surveyed by researchers say they struggle to afford enough food or a place to live.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy\nIran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site\nJamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is \u2018Well on the Way\u2019\nOne of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks\nFlorida\u2019s 125% Surge in Property-Insurance Bills Sows Havoc\nThe national study, published Wednesday by the University of Illinois Chicago\u2019s Center for Urban Economic Development, asked US employees about their economic wellbeing, including whether they\u2019d skipped meals, went hungry, or were worried about being able to make rent or mortgage payments.\nFifty-three percent of respondents reported that they\u2019d experienced one or more forms of food insecurity in the prior three months, and 48% experienced one or more forms of housing insecurity. Workers who said they took unpaid time off after getting hurt on the job were more likely to report trouble paying their bills, the researchers found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that Amazon\u2019s an outlier,\u201d said Sanjay Pinto, who co-authored the study with Beth Gutelius. Still, \u201cthey\u2019re certainly not taking the lead in creating family-sustaining jobs.\u201d\nIn an emailed statement, Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly called the researchers\u2019 methodology \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and said the company had tried to raise its concerns with the study\u2019s authors but never heard back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a survey that ignores best practices for surveying, has limited verification safeguards to confirm respondents are Amazon employees, and doesn\u2019t prevent multiple responses from the same person,\u201d he said. Kelly added that Amazon has increased average pay to $20.50 an hour and provides a range of benefits, including health care, dental, 401(k) and pre-paid tuition.\nAmazon has long been criticized for its treatment of employees, especially those who pack and ship boxes in its warehouses. Much of the criticism has focused on injuries that have exceeded the rate of logistics industry peers. Amazon has pledged to make its warehouses safer, in part by automating aspects of the job that require repetitive motions. Pinto and Gutelius examined injuries among Amazon\u2019s ranks in a report published in October before turning their focus to workers\u2019 economic circumstances.\nThe Seattle-based company is the second-largest private-sector employer in the US behind Walmart Inc. Amazon accounts for about 29% of the US warehousing industry workforce, the researchers estimate. As such, the company plays a leading role in setting pay and working conditions of a sector transformed by e-commerce.\nThe 98-question online survey sought out Amazon employees through social media advertising, targeting warehouses and neighborhoods that host company facilities. The researchers also sprinkled in quality checks to weed out responses from people who appeared to be giving inauthentic responses.\nA total of 1,484 workers in 42 states gave enough information to be included in the results. For the portions dealing with economic security, the sample size varied between 1,306 and 1,472 respondents. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. The work was funded by the Ford Foundation, Oxfam America and the pro-labor nonprofit National Employment Law Project.\nA third of survey respondents reported using government-funded programs \u2013 primarily food stamps or Medicaid \u2013 in the last three months. That echoes a 2020 analysis by the US Government Accountability Office, which found Amazon was among the biggest employers of people receiving food assistance in nine states that reported the data.\nAmazon\u2019s median US employee was paid $45,613 in 2023, up from $41,762 the year before, the company said in a filing last month. The company says employees in warehousing and transportation are paid more than $20.50 an hour, on average. The survey, which was conducted between April and August 2023, excluded managers and skews a bit lower: Most respondents reported wages from $16 to $20 an hour.\nSome 65% of workers who come to Amazon earn more than they were making at their previous employer, the survey shows. And the same percentage of workers report receiving a raise while working at the company. Moving up the ranks in Amazon\u2019s assembly-line like warehouses is a tougher proposition: Just 13% of workers reported receiving a promotion during their time at the company, survey data showed.\nRespondents who joined Amazon from another company were most likely to have previously worked in food preparation and services, sales and manufacturing.\n\u201cThe story of Amazon is a sad story of the declining expectations of American workers of their employer,\u201d said study co-author Gutelius, a longtime researcher of logistics and warehouse work.\n--With assistance from Spencer Soper.\n(Updated with Amazon comment in the 5th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGoogle\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com will introduce a more conversational artificial intelligence-powered version of its Alexa voice assistant later this year and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset technology costs, CNBC reported on Wednesday.\nWhile the e-commerce giant is yet to nail down the price of the new services, a subscription to Alexa will not be included in its popular $139 annual Prime offering, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the company's plans.\nAmazon declined to comment on the report.\nThe company said in September it was working on a generative AI-powered version of Alexa, amid growing competition from chatbots made by OpenAI and Alphabet's Google.\nIt doubled down on the plan in its annual shareholder letter, published last month, saying it was building GenAI applications across its consumer businesses, including a more capable Alexa.\nThe company introduced Alexa in 2014 but has not found a consistent means to make it profitable, instead driving shoppers to the company's website for more purchases.\nMeanwhile, OpenAI unveiled a new AI model called GPT-4o last week, which enables users to speak to ChatGPT and obtain real-time responses without lag. It can also interrupt ChatGPT.\nGoogle also revealed upgraded versions of its Gemini chatbot as well as improvements to its search engine last week.\nApple, too, is planning an AI overhaul for its Siri virtual assistant - which is seen as another laggard in the AI race - according to media reports.\nThe CNBC report said Amazon would use its own Titan large language model for the Alexa upgrade.\nThe company has made hefty bets on AI, including a $4 billion investment in Anthropic, whose Claude chatbot competes with ChatGPT.\nStill, investors worry that Microsoft's early lead in the AI race through its OpenAI investment could help it wrest a bulk of market share in the cloud industry from Amazon Web Services, the largest player in the space.\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n"

        "Title": "How Shein and Temu Snuck Up on Amazon",
        "Author": "  Louise Matsakis ",
        "Text": "In the fall of 2020, Amazon looked unstoppable. The pandemic lockdowns had supercharged its e-commerce business, and executives were busy hiring an army of new workers and expanding the number of Amazon fulfillment warehouses across the U.S. But the tech giant would soon face the biggest threat to its online shopping empire in recent memory, and it would come from an unlikely place: China.\nOver the last few years, two Chinese-owned e-commerce platforms \u2014 Shein and Temu \u2014 have quietly become some of the most popular shopping websites in the U.S. Shein specializes in low-end women\u2019s fashion, while Temu focuses on home decor and household items \u2014 the same type of affordable, made-in-China products that many American consumers have come to associate with Amazon.\nTemu had 47 million U.S. monthly active users in April, while Shein had 29 million. Amazon clocked in at 66 million, down from almost 70 million in September of 2022 when Temu launched, according to estimates from the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\nShein and Temu\u2019s users aren\u2019t just browsing. Shein reportedly earned roughly $45 billion last year, and is currently trying to go public. PDD Holdings, Temu\u2019s Chinese parent company, reported earlier this week that its revenue surged more than 130% in the first quarter. PDD is now the most valuable e-commerce company in China.\nThe two startups are sending so many orders from China to the U.S. that it\u2019s causing air cargo rates to spike, and USPS workers have said publicly that they are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of Temu\u2019s signature bright orange packages they have to deliver. \u201cI\u2019m tired of this Temu shit, ya\u2019ll killing me,\u201d one mailman said in a TikTok video last year with over two million likes. \u201cEveryday it\u2019s Temu, Temu, Temu \u2014 I\u2019m Temu tired.\u201d\nEveryday it\u2019s Temu, Temu, Temu \u2014 I\u2019m Temu tired.\nAmazon has taken notice of its competitors\u2019 swift rise. In meetings related to its retail business, the company has shifted focus away from traditional rivals like Walmart and Target and toward Shein and Temu. In December, Amazon announced it was sharply reducing the fees it charges sellers for clothing items under $20, a move that appeared designed to ensure its prices were competitive with Shein.\nI\u2019ve been following Shein for over four years and was one of the first reporters to cover Temu when it launched in 2022. But even as the two platforms exploded in popularity, I noticed that Silicon Valley seemed largely oblivious to their success. That may, in part, be by design \u2014 Temu and Shein are notoriously tight-lipped \u2014 but my hunch is that it has more to do with their customer bases.\nWhile a countless number of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer startups went after upper-middle class urbanites in recent years, Shein and Temu deliberately tried to court people outside places like San Francisco and New York, especially women. In other words, the male-dominated venture capital and tech industries may have initially missed these platforms because they were catching on among demographics outside their usual orbit.\nThe average American Shein shopper is female, in her early 30s, and earns roughly $65,000 a year, according to a report by UBS Securities. Temu\u2019s fastest-growing demographic in March was consumers between the ages of 55 to 64, leading younger people to make fun of their older relatives for becoming \u201cTemu victims.\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts found that the majority of Temu\u2019s customers are also women, and more than half make less than $50,000 annually. That mirrors the consumer profile PDD targeted with its first shopping app in China, Pinduoduo, which launched in 2015 and has more than 750 million monthly active users.\nIn 2018, PDD\u2019s founder Colin Huang said he wanted Pinduoduo to appeal not just to the urban rich, but also those outside of \u201cBeijing\u2019s fifth ring,\u201d a term that refers to people with modest incomes who live away from major Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai. The same year, The New York Times published one of my favorite editorial photographs of all time: A portrait of a 45-year-old street food vendor from a suburban Chinese town surrounded by all the things he had impulse bought on Pinduoduo, including an inflatable raft, a pink keyboard, and a mini motorized toy car for his daughter to ride around in. The accompanying article perfectly foreshadowed the type of customers Temu would seek out in the U.S.\nTo lure these shoppers to their platforms, Shein and Temu poured billions of dollars into digital advertising. Temu spent nearly $2 billion on Instagram and Facebook advertisements alone last year, according to The Wall Street Journal (Temu disputed the accuracy of the figure). Last February, Temu was reportedly running approximately 9,400 Facebook ads simultaneously, while Shein was running 2,200, according to a Chinese news site. Meta recently reported that its overall revenue from China nearly doubled in 2023 compared to the year prior, while U.S-based revenue rose less than 6%.\nTemu made its biggest marketing splash yet when it ran six separate Super Bowl commercials this year, which may have cost PDD tens of millions of dollars in total. It was the second time in a row that Temu advertised during the big game; its sister app Pinduoduo has previously ran commercials during China\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s gala, the country\u2019s most popular annual television event. A recent YouGov survey found that 88% of Americans now say they have heard of Temu, and most found out about the platform after seeing an ad for it.\nAside from their aggressive marketing, Shein and Temu also attract new customers by offering steep discounts or free products, especially in exchange for referring friends and family to their platforms. These promotions can be extravagant \u2014 I spoke to one person last year who bought a Nintendo Switch on Temu for $15 \u2014 causing U.S. shoppers to sometimes assume they are scams. In fact, the most frequent question I hear from people I know about Temu is, \u201cAre you sure this website is legitimate?\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t help that browsing on Shein and Temu often feels more like being inside a digital arcade or casino rather than a shopping mall. Both companies designed their platforms to maximize metrics like time spent, viewing them as a form of entertainment rather than a tool that can save you a trip to a physical store. That\u2019s a fundamentally different approach from Amazon, which has introduced a series of features to help people get their shopping done as quickly as possible, including the \u201cBuy Again\u201d widget on its homepage and the \u201cBuy Now\u201d function that lets consumers check out with a single click.\nWhen I recently redownloaded the Temu app, I was greeted with a spinning wheel game, which allowed me to win \u201c100% OFF For 3 items.\u201d I was then immediately prompted to play a separate \u201cMultiplier Card\u201d game, which gave me \u201c700% OFF valued coupon bundle\u201d that I could use to get a rebate of up to $300, but only on certain items. Lastly, Temu asked me to pick from a selection of free gifts, including a white synthetic tank top, an electric nose hair trimmer, and a baseball cap that said \u201cSHIT SHOW SUPERVISOR\u201d on it.\nShein engages in similar engagement schemes. The fast-fashion retailer has an elaborate loyalty rewards program that allows people to earn points that can later be used to buy free clothes. You can receive points for checking the app every day, leaving product reviews, and making purchases, among other behaviors.\nBut the real innovation behind Shein and Temu is the proprietary software they use to manage their supply chains.\nShein works with thousands of garment suppliers in China, and it requires them to sign up for its \u201cmanufacturing execution system,\u201d or MES, which provides almost instantaneous feedback about which products are hits and which are misses.\nShein operates according to a model it pioneered called \u201clarge-scale automated test and re-order,\u201d or LATR. It starts by buying a very small batch of each style, as few as several dozen pieces. It then waits to see how customers respond. If a certain sequin crop top or pair of wide leg jeans quickly sells out, it orders more. LATR is what allows Shein to add thousands of new products to its website every day, each of which serve as a mini A/B test. Unlike traditional clothing retailers, Shein doesn\u2019t need to buy large orders of different styles that could wind up being duds.\nShein\u2019s software has been so beneficial to the company that it is now reportedly exploring licensing it to other brands and designers. Last year, it also launched an Amazon-like marketplace where both Chinese and international merchants can sell their own products. The company has branched out into makeup, electronics, and pet supplies.\nTemu, unlike Amazon, uses a \u201cfully managed\u201d marketplace model, according to the research consultancy Tech Buzz China. Merchants agree on a sale price and send their goods to Temu\u2019s fulfillment centers, and it handles all shipments to the consumer. Temu was able to recruit manufacturers and sellers to its platform by promising they wouldn\u2019t need to worry about things like warehousing and shipping costs. About 10% of Temu merchants are also selling on Amazon, Tech Buzz China reported in December.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean sellers are necessarily happy with Temu and Shein. Both companies have a reputation for forcing manufacturers to contend with razor-thin profit margins and putting pressure on them to reduce their prices. They have also accused each other of trying to steal suppliers or prevent them from working with one another. In December, Temu filed a lawsuit against Shein, accusing the company of using illegal \u201cmafia-style intimidation\u201d tactics against its sellers, including holding them hostage for hours. (Shein said the claims are without merit.)\nThe two companies have faced other public scandals, including allegations that they ripped off designs from smaller brands and sold products containing substances that could be harmful or toxic. Federal lawmakers published a report last year raising concerns that Temu and Shein and Temu may be illegally importing goods that were made using forced labor in China\u2019s far western Xinjiang region, where the government has compelled Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to pick cotton and work in factories for low wages.\nIn response, Temu began requiring suppliers to certify that their cotton didn\u2019t originate from Xinjiang, but it walked back the policy only a few weeks later, according to The Information. Temu told the news site that it rigorously oversees its supply chain and believes its practices are in line with American competitors like Amazon and eBay. Shein has said previously that it doesn\u2019t work with manufacturers in Xinjiang.\nThe season finale of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d last week included a parody commercial for an ethically dubious fast fashion company called Xiemu, which was clearly meant to sound like Shein and Temu\u2019s names mixed together. \u201cModern styles, designer dupes, no prisoners involved!\u201d the narrator says. \u201cDid there used to be or something? Why bring that up?\u201d Jake Gyllenhaal replies with a quiver in his voice.\nModern styles, designer dupes, no prisoners involved! Did there used to be or something? Why bring that up?\nWhen I shared the skit on X, a number of people were quick to point out that American brands have engaged in many of the same worrisome practices Shein and Temu are being accused of, not least of which is using prison labor. Some noted that Amazon has faced allegations that it worked with suppliers that rely on forced Uyghur workers in China, too.\nBut lawmakers and the companies\u2019 critics say it\u2019s relatively difficult to detect issues with packages shipped from Shein and Temu because they are both able to take advantage of a trade loophole referred to as the \u201cde minimis threshold.\u201d It allows companies to ship items from overseas directly to individual consumers without paying tariffs, as long as their value is less than $800.\nShein and Temu often send packages from China to their final destination. Lawmakers say that allows them to use de minimis to undercut the prices of their brick-and-mortar competitors that have to pay traditional tariffs on retail goods. Using the loophole also makes it harder for customs officials to oversee what\u2019s coming into the country, since they now have to monitor hundreds of thousands of tiny packages rather than just large shipping containers. (Shein called last year for the de minimis rule to be overhauled.)\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if these controversies will prevent Shein and Temu from continuing to grow in the U.S. But both companies are already setting their sights on the rest of the world. Temu has opened up shop in more than 60 countries and is actively trying to lower its dependence on American consumers. Shein is expanding across the globe as well, finding early success in places like Latin America.\nEven if Amazon ultimately maintains its grip on the U.S. e-commerce market, its Chinese competitors pose a much more formidable threat in emerging markets. That reality may be part of the reason Amazon is putting greater emphasis on revenue streams like cloud computing and original content, businesses that will remain lucrative in a future where most of the world is buying from Chinese shopping platforms.\nLouise Matsakis writes You May Also Like, a newsletter about tech, e-commerce, and China.

        "Text": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.5% and 6.4% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>The ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in AMZN?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 11.5% over the past month to $4.43.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.

        "Text": "Amazon keeps adding to its empire\u2014both on the fulfillment side and on the renewable energy side.\nThe company keeps snapping up and building real estate throughout the U.S., a move that comes as other players\u2014particularly Walmart\u2014ramp up comeptition with the e-commerce juggernaut.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nGXO Establishes Gig Worker Program at Warehouses\nExclusive: State of Supply Chain Report Shows Execs Lag in Adopting AI\nBlue Yonder Plans to Bring AI-Powered Agents to Various Supply Chain Roles\nAccording to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s April letter to shareholders, the company has been focusing heavily on faster delivery times, made possible in part by an increase in localized facilities.\n\u201cIn 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the U.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased the number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70 percent YoY.\u201d\nJassy also said the company\u2019s inbound fulfillment processes and how and where it places its inventory are in focus for 2024. Indeed, Amazon seems to be putting its money where its mouth is.\nIn 2024, Amazon has already\u2014or has plans to\u2014add more than 20 million more square feet of fulfillment center space to its real estate portfolio, according to MWPVL. New facilities have or will be popping up in California, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oregon and other states, the supply chain consultancy\u2019s tracking documents show.\nThese more regionalized fulfillment centers, Jassy said, have helped to decrease the length of travel for orders, which decreases the company\u2019s cost to serve. With the savings, Amazon can \u201cinvest in speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices,\u201d Jassy said.\nBut fulfillment centers aren\u2019t the only infrastructure Amazon has been investing in lately. The company announced Tuesday that its machine learning systems, powered by AWS, have been operationalized at a solar energy site in Baldy Mesa, California.\nA machine learning algorithm will help a battery system determine how to store and subsequently distribute energy, particularly during times when it\u2019s dark out. During the daytime, the grid runs on solar, so long as it\u2019s not too cloudy for the sun\u2019s rays to reach the solar panels effectively. Simultaneously, the battery energy storage system (BESS) charges, capturing energy to use for later.\nBy using technology to capture and release the appropriate amounts of energy, Amazon is working to ensure carbon-free energy is available to power the grid even when the sun isn\u2019t out, Kara Hurst, Amazon\u2019s vice president of worldwide sustainability, said in a blog post.\n\u201cAI is an important tool that\u2019s already helping our society make the transition to carbon-free energy and address climate change at scale,\u201d said Kara Hurst, Amazon\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Sustainability. \u201cPairing solar projects enabled by Amazon with AI technologies powered by AWS helps to ensure the grid and the customers it serves receive a steady supply of carbon-free energy for more hours each day, while also helping Amazon make progress toward our commitment to be a more sustainable company.\u201d\nThis particular facility, a utility-scale project, is owned and operated by AES Corporation. Amazon has also helped to enable 10 solar-plus-storage projects in the southwestern U.S., including the Bellefield project, one of AES\u2019 other solar and battery sites in Kern County, California. That project is expected to be the largest planned solar-plus-storage facility in the U.S., according to the company.\nHowever, the company has also begun piloting the technology at one of its natively owned facilities: its air hub in San Bernardino, California, about an hour away from the Baldy Mesa site.\u00a0At the site, the company owns a 5.8-megawatt solar array that is complemented by a 2.5 MW BESS. The energy ingested by the BESS is leveraged at night or at times of high pressure on the at-large grid in the area.\nThe company plans to use the data and learnings it gathers from the San Bernardino site, and others, for an AI model that could share predictive insights into Amazon\u2019s green energy-integrated sites.\nKevin Hagen, interim CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Assocation, said marrying emerging technologies with renewable energy could be a viable way for the e-commerce industry to decrease its carbon footprint.\n\u201cBattery storage projects enable increased use of renewable energy, helping ensure that the clean energy from solar and wind projects is available to the grid at all times,\u201d said Kevin Hagen, the Clean Energy Buyers Association\u2019s interim CEO. \u201cEnergy storage, smarter and more interactive load management tools, and AI are among the new technologies that hold significant potential in a lower-cost transition to carbon-free energy.\u201d\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this online retailer have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.54 points to a change of +56.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +14.5%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $148.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $638.26 billion and $709.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +11.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "The US' Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit against Amazon regarding its Prime membership programme continues, Reuters has reported.\nA Seattle judge recently rejected Amazon's attempt to dismiss the case.\nThe FTC accuses Amazon of deceptive practices in enrolling customers into Prime memberships and then making it difficult to cancel.\nThe FTC first filed the lawsuit in June 2023, alleging that Amazon had misled consumers and made it cumbersome to cancel Prime subscriptions.\nAccording to the FTC, some customers signed up for Prime unintentionally and were charged for multiple months before cancelling.\nReuters noted Amazon argued against the FTC's claims, stating that it clearly disclosed key points such as pricing and automatic renewal to Prime users.\nIt further accused the FTC of using undefined terms such as incorporating a 'manipulative' website design to unfairly target it.\nThe FTC, however, countered that Amazon employed deceptive user interface designs, known as 'dark patterns,' to trick users into signing up for automatically renewing subscriptions.\nThe FTC seeks both civil penalties and a permanent injunction to prevent such practices in the future.\nAccording to Reuters, this lawsuit is part of the Biden administration's broader effort to regulate big tech companies.\nThe FTC also has a separate antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of restricting merchants from offering lower prices. That case is set for trial in October 2026.\nInterestingly, the FTC claims that Amazon revamped its cancellation process in April 2023, likely due to pressure from the agency.\nHowever, the FTC argues that cancelling Prime still requires an excessive number of clicks (five on desktop and six on mobile).\nThe upcoming non-jury trial for the Prime membership lawsuit is scheduled for February 2025.\nThis case has significant implications for e-commerce businesses and their subscription practices, with potential consequences for how companies acquire and retain customers.\n\"Amazon faces FTC lawsuit over allegedly deceptive Prime practices\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Natalie Lung and Matt Day ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is increasing its stake in Grubhub to as much as 18% and expanding its partnership with the food delivery service to allow US users to order takeout directly on Amazon\u2019s website and shopping app.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nModi Set to Lose India Majority, Needs Allies to Keep Power\nShort Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains\nMnuchin Chases Wall Street Glory With His War Chest of Foreign Money\nHow Billionaires Bought 70% of Detroit\u2019s Offices and Transformed the City\nNYSE Fixes Issue That Showed 99% Drops, Triggered Trading Halts\nAmazon already had a 4% stake in Grubhub, up from 2% when it announced its earlier deal with Grubhub in 2022. Under the new five-year agreement, Amazon will receive options for an additional 3% stake in Grubhub and another 1% a year from now, Grubhub\u2019s Dutch parent Just Eat Takeaway.com NV said in a statement on Thursday. It will have the opportunity to increase the holding to 18%, depending on the performance of the partnership and the number of orders.\nJust Eat Takeaway\u2019s shares rose 2.4% to \u20ac12.2 at 12:26 p.m. in Amsterdam trading on Thursday after earlier gaining as much as 5%.\n\u201cThis will enable us to engage with the tens of millions of Prime members and introduce them to Grubhub,\u201d said Grubhub Chief Executive Officer Howard Migdal in an interview. \u201cWe expect this to be a large catalyst for new customer growth for Grubhub.\u201d\nAs part of the deal, Amazon Prime shoppers will also receive a free Grubhub+ membership.\nAmazon has made a habit of acquiring stakes in its major business partners, often through warrants, an effort to realize more of the financial windfall of the tie-up. The retail and cloud-computing giant has in recent years scooped up stakes in the airlines that fly Amazon cargo aircraft, an electric vehicle maker, a grocery distributor and software companies, among other firms.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\u201cJust Eat Takeaway\u2019s five-year pact with Amazon incorporates Grubhub (GH) into Prime in what may be a longer-term solution to reverse US user losses. But the new agreement, more than the current tie-in, also replaces GH\u2019s own-subscription revenue potential and makes a sale of the company to another party less likely. Just Eat, which saw US profit losses ease in 2023, is effectively providing a white-label food-delivery service for Prime members.\u201d\n\u2014 Diana Gomes, BI Senior Industry Analyst\nClick here for the research\nFor Just Eat, the partnership could help temper the double-digit declines it\u2019s seen in orders and gross transaction value in the North American market. Meanwhile, the firm has been contending with weak demand for food deliveries in Europe, its home region.\nJust Eat executives said in April that the company was still exploring the partial or full sale of US-based Grubhub, which it acquired for $7.3 billion in 2021. Just Eat announced plans to divest in April 2022 but attributed delays to high price demands from some investors and a weak market for deals.\nCompetition between food-delivery firms in the US has also been intense. Grubhub\u2019s market share in the US has been on a steady decline since 2021, reaching around 8% in March, according to Bloomberg Second Measure data. It trails behind DoorDash Inc., which holds a 67% lead, and Uber Technologies Inc., which has 23%.\nThe embedding of Grubhub within the Amazon app will also help raise awareness of the ongoing Grubhub+ promotion. A Grubhub membership otherwise costs $120 a year in exchange for lower service charges and waived delivery fees on select orders.\n\u201cCustomers we\u2019ve gotten from Amazon, who\u2019ve linked their Prime accounts, order more frequently than our average customers,\u201d Migdal said. \u201cThey\u2019re a really good cohort of customers,\u201d he added, saying the partnership has also helped Amazon retain Prime subscribers.\nAmazon started offering members of its Prime program free delivery from Grubhub in 2022, a benefit it portrayed as a temporary perk. The offer was extended a year later. Now, Amazon says it plans to offer members \u2014 who pay $139 a year in the US \u2014 free delivery through Grubhub on an ongoing basis. The company says it has more than 200 million Prime members globally.\nAmazon in recent years has rolled back some Prime perks, including raising the free-delivery minimum for Amazon\u2019s own grocery delivery services. Viewers of previously ad-free Prime Video now see streaming ads. At the same time, the company has added Grubhub memberships, along with programs for discounted drugs and medical care, to get shoppers to keep paying for a service that began as a speedy shipping program.\nInstacart earlier this month announced a similar plan to embed Uber Eats\u2019 ordering interface within the Instacart app. Unlike that partnership, however, Grubhub is not required to pay Amazon a referral fee or additional costs per order.\nGrubhub\u2019s announcement may also be a boon for its nearly 200,000 delivery drivers in the US as restaurants get more orders from Amazon users and possibly more visibility. \u201cWe do have waiting lists in many cities for more couriers so we\u2019re hopeful this will turn into more earning opportunities for couriers, as well,\u201d Migdal said.\n--With assistance from Cagan Koc.\n(Updates with Just Eat Takeaway share reaction in third paragraph and analyst quote)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle\nStartup Brings New Hope to the Pursuit of Reviving Frozen Bodies\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year\nDisney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track\nHow Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com's cloud unit on Wednesday said it has partnered with artificial intelligence startup Hugging Face to make it easier to run thousands of AI models on Amazon's custom computing chips.\nValued at $4.5 billion, Hugging Face has become a central hub for AI researchers and developers to share chatbots and other AI software and is backed by Amazon, Alphabet's Google and Nvidia, among others. It is the main place that developers go to obtain and tinker with open-source AI models such as Meta Platforms' Llama 3.\nBut once developers have tweaked an open-source AI model they typically want to use the model to power a piece of software. On Wednesday, Amazon and Hugging Face said they had paired up to make it possible to do so on a custom Amazon Web Services (AWS) chip called Inferentia2.\n\"One thing that's very important to us is efficiency - making sure that as many people as possible can run models and that they can run them in the most cost effective way,\" said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face.\nFor its part, AWS is hoping to lure more AI developers to use its cloud services for delivering AI. While Nvidia dominates the market for training models, AWS argues it chips can then operate those trained models - a process called inference - at lower cost over time.\n\"You train these models maybe once a month.

Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Walmart Inc. have all invested in drones with mixed success.\nPrime Air was slow to launch. A Bloomberg investigation in 2022 revealed that the program was beset by technical challenges, high turnover and safety concerns.

That said, let\u2019s review Amazon\u2019s Q1 results and see why now may still be a good time to buy stock in the e-commerce behemoth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQ1 Review & Cloud Growth\nAmazon\u2019s AWS cloud computing segment fueled its strong Q1 results driven by growth in generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across various industries. First quarter sales increased 12% to $143.3 billion and came in slightly above estimates of $142.52 billion. AWS contributed $25 billion to the top line, beating estimates by 3% and increasing 17% year over year as Amazon remains the domestic cloud leader ahead of Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google Cloud.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMore importantly, Amazon\u2019s operating income skyrocketed 221% to 15.3 billion. This led to earnings of $1.13 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus of $0.83 a share by 36% and climbed from $0.31 a share in the comparative quarter. Notably, Amazon has now exceeded earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters and has posted an average earnings surprise of 48.17% in its last four quarterly reports.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQ2 Revenue Guidance\nFor the second quarter, Amazon expects net sales to be between $144-$149 billion or 7%-11% growth which falls slightly below the current Zacks Consensus of $150.21 billion or roughly 12% growth (Current Qtr below). According to Zacks estimates, Amazon\u2019s total sales are projected to expand 11% this year and jump another 11% in fiscal 2025 to $716.01 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAverage Zacks Price Target \nWith many analysts raising their price targets for Amazon\u2019s stock this morning including those of UBS and Oppenheimer, it's noteworthy that the Average Zacks Price Target of $209.95 suggests 20% upside from current levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nAt the moment, Amazon's stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\u00a0Although Amazon\u2019s revenue guidance fell slightly below the Zacks Consensus, earnings estimate revisions could go up after the company comfortably exceeded Q1 EPS estimates and posted strong growth outside of its e-commerce buisness.\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Amazon Fresh just became the latest big-box retailer to cut costs on thousands of items, following in the footsteps of Walmart and Target in reversing course on years of inflation-induced price hikes in a bid to lure back disgruntled customers.\nThe company\u2019s Amazon Fresh subsidiary announced Thursday it will slash the costs of 4,000 weekly rotating grocery products by up to 30%. The discounts will apply to both national and Amazon\u2019s store brands.\n\u201cIncreasing our Weekly Deals across thousands of items and expanding the reach of Prime Savings at Amazon Fresh is just one way that we\u2019re continuing to invest in competitive pricing and savings for all of our customers\u2014both in-store and online,\u201d Amazon Fresh worldwide vice president Claire Peters said in a statement.\nLast week saw an onslaught of retailers offering discounts on essential items: Target made a similar promise as Amazon's, saying it would cut the prices of 5,000 items including diapers and pet food. The retailer rolled out its \u201cdealworthy\u201d discount brand in February, introducing 400 household and essential products mostly under $10. Walmart also said it would lower costs of 7,000 items, a 45% increase in price rollbacks. Aldi and Kroger both made moves to lower grocery prices as well.\nThese price cuts come after persistent inflation raised the cost of groceries 1.1% year over year as of April. That\u2019s down 0.1% from March and significantly less than the 4.1% year-over-year price increase for food from restaurants, leaving retailers with an opportunity to take advantage on consumers\u2019 increased reliance on groceries.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to lead on price, and we\u2019re going to manage our [profit] margins, and we\u2019re going to be the Walmart that we\u2019ve always been,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts this month.\nBig-box stores lowering prices wasn\u2019t an altruistic move to throw customers a bone during tough times. Retailers have suffered from weak sales due to customers\u2019 struggle with high prices. Target reported a 3.1% drop in net sales from a year ago and a 3.7% quarterly dip in comparable sales, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of declines. Though Walmart has continued to soar, it owes much of its 6% revenue growth to its e-commerce successes and wealthy customer base, the latter of which makes up a growing chunk of its audience.\nThis trend has continued in fast food, with McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, and Burger King all announcing meal deals following earnings reports that suggest customers are losing their taste for high-priced fast food, including $18 Big Mac meals and threats of surge pricing.\nMoreover, retailers\u2019 decision to hike prices in the first place can\u2019t all be attributed to inflation, Lindsay Owens, executive director of economic policy group Groundwork Collaborative, argued. She told the Washington Post that companies actually increased their margins in times of increased operating costs. A March 2024 Federal Trade Commission report found retail revenue for food and beverages increased 7% above total costs in the first three quarters of 2023, indicating that grocery stores\u2019 decision to raise prices wasn\u2019t just a result of inflation, supply-chain disruptions, or the rising prices of commodities.\n\u201cWhat you see is that\u2019s effectively made possible by companies who are passing along their rising costs in full but then going for more,\u201d Owens said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": " Hamza Shaban    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "The CEO of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud computing business, Adam Selipsky, is stepping down next month, the company announced Tuesday, punctuating a phase of rapid growth at the division and a broader transition in a tech sector that is scrambling to capitalize on the coming AI-led era.\nMatt Garman, senior vice president of sales and marketing at AWS, will replace Selipsky as CEO effective June 3, the company said.\nSelipsky's departure comes at a high point for AWS. The cloud services unit is rapidly expanding and has reached a significant milestone of generating a $100 billion run rate. Amazon's broader artificial intelligence strategy runs through AWS, the industry's top cloud service by market share. During the company's most recent earnings report, executives said cloud customers are increasingly signing up for bigger deals with longer commitments, many with generative AI components.\nAmazon stock was down just under 1% during morning trading.\n\"Given the state of the business and the leadership team, now is an appropriate moment for me to make this transition, and to take the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities,\" Selipsky said. He took over AWS in 2021.\nSelipsky, whose three-year tenure was defined by the pandemic, oversaw the business as companies were reeling from the disruptions of the public health crisis and pulled back from spending. But the cloud division has since posted swelling sales growth.\nLast quarter revenue for AWS came in at $25 billion, beating analyst expectations and increasing about 17% compared to the same period last year.\n\"I\u2019d like to thank Adam for everything he\u2019s done to lead AWS over the past three years. He took over in the middle of the pandemic, which presented a wide array of leadership and business challenges,\" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a note to employees Tuesday.\nGarman has worked at Amazon for nearly 18 years, starting as an MBA intern in 2005 and becoming one of the first AWS product managers. He\u2019d go on to serve in the same division as general manager of all AWS compute services and later as the head of sales and marketing. His career tracks the development of AWS, which has grown to become the company\u2019s most profitable unit. That Amazon would appoint an AWS veteran to lead the key division highlights the importance of the role and the pivotal moment for the company.\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is among the tech giants racing to claim market share and launch new consumer services, largely based around its major cloud services business. Earlier this year, Amazon increased its investment in the AI startup Anthropic, committing another $2.75 billion to bring its investment total to $4 billion.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "A new transportation services agreement to operate 10 Boeing 767 cargo jets for Amazon paved the way for pilots at cargo airline ABX Air over the weekend to ratify an extension of their labor contract until 2030, company officials said Tuesday.\nAmazon\u2019s assignment of planes to ABX Air was also made possible by union leaders\u2019 more collaborative approach to jointly growing business after a history of tensions and a shortage of captains at sister airline Air Transport International, they said.\nParent company Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG) on Monday announced it signed a five-year deal with Amazon to operate an additional 10 Boeing 767-300 converted freighters on behalf of its largest customer, which will supply the aircraft. ABX Air will hire more than 50 pilots to support the new contract.\nThe pilot contract was negotiated in three days and provides Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) with the long-term labor stability it needs, ATSG Chief Executive Officer Joe Hete said during an earnings call with analysts about the company\u2019s first-quarter results. The agreement came about because the pilots approached the company and offered to extend it beyond the 2026 eligibility date for making amendments.\nThe Airline Professionals Association \u201chad a hole to dig out of and finally came to the realization that maybe there\u2019s a better way to approach this than the traditional, let\u2019s- go-after-the-company kind of thing. They came to us with an offer to extend the existing agreement to give potential customers some comfort that they wouldn\u2019t experience any labor disruptions in the future,\u201d he said.\nHete was referring to a short strike initiated by the union in 2016 during the first year of operations for Amazon\u2019s private airline and on the eve of the Black Friday shopping period. The strike disrupted fulfillment operations and soured Amazon on giving new business to ABX.\nAmazon is expected to provide the first cargo jet in June and the remaining aircraft by year\u2019s end. The agreement includes an option for Amazon to sublease 10 more aircraft to ATSG after 2024.\nOnly four of the 40 B767 cargo jets currently flown by ATSG for Amazon are under the ABX brand. Air Transport International operates the other 36 aircraft in Amazon\u2019s domestic parcel network. The new deal will bring to 50 the number of aircraft in ATSG\u2019s Amazon portfolio, including 30 planes owned by ATSG and leased to Amazon as part of a bundled service package.\nFreightWaves recently reported on how the Airline Professionals Association has adopted a more conciliatory style to help rebuild trust with management, including acting as an unofficial ATSG marketing arm that promotes high service levels before potential customers.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve also done a fabulous job over the last several years presenting themselves at industry conferences. Normally, you will not see airlines and unions represented at the industry conferences,\u201d said ATSG President Mike Berger. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a really nice job of rebranding themselves in a very positive way. And I think this is an example of the fruits of their labor.\u201d\nHete said the combination of a changed union attitude and the better hourly pay scales it could offer because of higher rates in the Amazon contract enabled a collective bargaining agreement and the ability to attract new pilots.\n\u201cYou have to have realistic expectations on both sides of the table. Obviously, we had to give some stuff up. And obviously they had to pull back from what others think the market is for our type of business,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a passenger airline, we\u2019re not a FedEx or UPS. We\u2019re in a different marketplace altogether. And, you know, when people put their minds to it, they can come to an agreement that works for everybody.\u201d\nWhile management and the unionized pilots at ABX Air are rowing in the same direction, relations between ATSG and the Air Transport International pilots are frayed. The ATI pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, earlier this year asked the National Mediation Board to disband mediated negotiations so they can eventually call a strike. The sides have been in talks since late 2020. The union has accused the company of stalling serious talks until a contract with Amazon is renewed in 2026, which would better enable executives to know what cost increases they could bear.\nThe union says ATI pilots are underpaid and overworked because of unfavorable crew scheduling, which resulted in 250 pilots leaving the airline last year. ATI has about 600 pilots. Union officers have said they want a contract similar to one approved at Hawaiian Airlines last year.\nABX pilots enjoy slightly better pay than their ATI counterparts. A 12-year captain makes $288 per hour at ABX and $282 at ATI. Someone with the same experience level at Atlas Air, another Amazon partner, earns $298 an hour, according to figures from ALPA.\nATSG and ATI union leaders participated in another mediation session last week. Hete said on Tuesday he doesn\u2019t expect an agreement to be completed this year because the union is being unrealistic.\n\u201cI think the fact that we were able to get something across the plate with the ABX guys says the company can get there from here,\u201d he said.\nOne reason ABX was a better candidate to take the new Amazon workload is that Air Transport International doesn\u2019t have enough captains. The airline has hired plenty of first officers, but most don\u2019t have enough experience to be captains yet, Hete said. The Air Line Pilots Association blames unsatisfactory working conditions and compensation for the shortfall, saying 250 pilots left the company last year \u2014 a 45% attrition rate.\nThe high turnover means Air Transport International is hiring pilots without sufficient experience to be in charge of a widebody jet like a 767, leading to a high washout rate during training and a workforce shortage, Mike Sterling, chair of the ATI Master Executive Council, told FreightWaves in February.\n\u201cThe ABX option with the new agreement certainly made it easier for us to onboard the necessary people in the tight time frame that we have,\u201d Hete explained. \u201cWe have to get these aircraft into service by December 1. And that\u2019s a lot of airplanes to bring on when we won\u2019t receive the first one until June.\u201d\nABX pilots also offer a cost advantage because all flights begin and end where the crew is permanently based. If pilots want to live elsewhere, they are responsible for getting to work on their own time and expense. Air Transport International pilots live around the country and are provided a company-paid ticket to whatever airport the aircraft is departing from. And the ATI pilots receive premium pay that has negatively impacted earnings in recent quarters, Hete added.\nATSG reported adjusted pretax earnings of $15 million in the first quarter, down $23 million from the same period in 2023.\nThe company\u2019s stock closed at $14.67 per share on Tuesday, up 12% from Monday\u2019s open.\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\u00a0\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\nABX Air pilots choose cooperation over confrontation\nPilots flying Amazon cargo say employer stalling contract talks\nInflation tempers Cargojet\u2019s outlook despite Q1 volume growth\nThe post ABX pilots win back Amazon business with power of positivity appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "In its latest report, Barclays (LON:BARC) provides a detailed analysis of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s performance in India, highlighting both challenges and growth opportunities. Despite facing a slowdown in certain segments, Amazon India remains a significant player in the country\u2019s burgeoning e-commerce market.\nAccording to Barclays, India's overall e-commerce gross merchandise value (GMV) is growing at around 20%, with government estimates pegging it at approximately $120 billion. Amazon holds just under 30% of this market. However, tax filings for the fiscal year ending March 2023 indicate that Amazon India\u2019s B2C revenue grew by a modest 3% year-over-year (y/y), a notable deceleration compared to the pandemic-boosted years.\nOffer: Click here and don't miss out on this exclusive offer to access premium features of InvestingPro, including the powerful screeners, fair value calculator, financial health check, etc. and embark on your journey towards financial success. And the best part? It is currently available at a 69% discount, priced at just INR 216/month.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) continues to be a strong performer in India, generating $1.6 billion in revenue with a 43% y/y growth, even after a high 66% y/y growth in the previous fiscal year. Conversely, Amazon Pay\u2019s revenue grew by only 5% y/y to $260 million, down from 17% in the prior year, indicating a loss of market share to other payment options.\nBarclays estimates that Amazon India\u2019s GMV for FY23, excluding B2B transactions, stands at around $18 billion, with an overall GMV of approximately $21 billion when including all business segments. This represents a 3-4% decline in USD terms, attributed to the continued reduction of the wholesale business following regulatory changes in 2019.\nAmazon India accounts for 4.8% of Amazon's international retail revenue but also 11% of its international operating income losses. For calendar Q1 2023, India generated $5.6 billion in revenue (up 1% y/y) and incurred $0.9 billion in pre-tax losses. Notably, Amazon has significantly reduced its total international operating income losses, with a substantial decrease from -$7.7 billion to -$0.5 billion year-over-year, thanks to cost-saving measures in mature international markets outside India. Barclays expects the operating income in India to stabilize without much fluctuation in the future.\nGovernment data suggests steady e-commerce growth in India at around 20% for 2024, consistent with last year, potentially reaching just over $120 billion in GMV. Other estimates, such as the Google-Tamasek-Bain study, suggest a lower figure, but Barclays relies on IBEF data for its global e-commerce industry model.\nIndia's per-capita e-commerce spending is still significantly lower than in Western markets due to lower income levels, but the trend is improving. A recent Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) study projects India\u2019s B2C e-commerce GMV to grow at a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), driven by a growing online shopper base and increasing per-capita consumption. Improvements in digital infrastructure and increasing digital-first habits among Tier 2+ populations are also contributing to this growth. However, challenges remain due to low population density and diverse consumer profiles in these areas.\nA Nielsen study commissioned by Amazon India reveals that Amazon.in is the preferred shopping destination for 68% of consumers during the annual festive season. Over 78% of consumers trust online shopping, with Amazon.in identified as the most trusted and convenient online brand.\nIn summary, despite regulatory challenges and market slowdowns, Amazon India demonstrates resilience with significant market share and steady revenue streams in AWS. The company's strategic focus on digital infrastructure and consumer trust continues to position it well in the evolving Indian e-commerce landscape.\nUnlock the true value of stocks with InvestingPro by clicking here \u2013 your ultimate stock analysis tool!

It found that Walmart and Amazon were the undisputed money-saving price leaders in the retail landscape. The rivalry between the two competitors was so intense that they had identical prices on identical products a whopping 70% of the time. By comparison, Target and Amazon matched prices just 26% of the time.\nLearn More: 6 Items You Should Buy at Five Below Instead of Amazon\nTry This: 5 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\nIn the 30% of the time Walmart and Amazon had mismatched prices, Amazon was the clear winner in a handful of categories, allowing you to cash in by buying from the right retailer with the lowest price.\nThe Profitero study found that in the vitamins and supplements category, No. 1 Amazon beat No. 2 Walmart\u2019s prices by 4%.\nFor example, a 250-count bottle of Centrum multivitamin tablets for men costs $19.98 at Walmart, but Amazon undersold its rival by lowering the price to $16.42.\nAmazon also beats Walmart\u2019s prices by 4% in the health and personal care category \u2014 but with some products, Amazon offers savings much greater than 4%.\nExplore More: 8 Best New Buys at Nordstrom Rack That Are Worth Every Penny\nOne example is a pack of two 27.7-ounce bottles of Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo with Hair Mask Treatment. Amazon charges just $19.99 for the pair, but you\u2019ll pay $39.99 at Walmart.\nAmazon also outdoes Walmart in the beauty category. In this case, the world\u2019s largest e-seller beats its rival\u2019s prices by 2% overall \u2014 but here, too, the savings are much more than average for some products.\nAt Walmart, a 1.7-ounce jar of Olay Skincare Regenerist Vitamin C + Peptide 24 hydrating moisturizer costs $29.94. At Amazon, the price is an identical $29.94, but you get two 1.7-ounce containers of the exact same moisturizing cream \u2014 double the product for the same price.\nBabies are expensive \u2014 more so if you shop for their basic needs at Walmart. The study found that Amazon undersold its chief competitor by 3% overall in the baby category.\nFor example, a 156-count box of Huggies Little Movers size 3 diapers costs $52.98 at Walmart. If you buy the same product on Amazon, you\u2019ll pay just $49.36. That\u2019s nearly $4 less \u2014 plus you save another $3 with a coupon at checkout.\nThe study found that overall, Amazon undersells Walmart by 3% on household supplies. One example is the do-everything Mr. Clean Magic Eraser multipurpose Durafoam cleaning pads.\nOn Amazon, a 10-pack of extra durable foam pads will run you $12.13. However, If you buy the exact same 10-pack at Walmart, you\u2019ll pay $13.24.\nAmazon came in first with the lowest overall prices for pet food, but this category was one of the rare instances where Walmart didn\u2019t take second place \u2014 the No. 2 cheapest pet food and supplies came from Chewy.\nEither way, when you\u2019re spending money on the non-human members of your house, it usually pays to shop at Amazon.

        "Author": "  Orianna Rosa Royle ",
        "Text": "Gen Z might be on to something when they say having a \"delulu\" mindset\u2014that is, having a perhaps unjustified belief in yourself\u2014is the secret to success. That\u2019s because Amazon\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy just revealed that it\u2019s not a ritzy college degree or being the best networker that will make you stand out at the start of your career\u2014but a positive attitude.\n\u201cAn embarrassing amount of how well you do, particularly in your twenties, has to do with attitude,\u201d Jassy said in an interview with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky.\nAfter giving up on a career in sportscasting and then dabbling in music management, Jassy\u2014who took Amazon\u2019s helm after Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021\u2014joined the tech giant in 1997 as a marketing manager. The Harvard Business School alumnus went on to launch the cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services with Bezos. By 2020, AWS generated $13.5 billion of Amazon\u2019s $22.9 billion in annual operating income, making him a clear candidate for CEO.\nLooking back, he told Roslansky that \u201cthere's so many things that you can't control in your work life, but you can control your attitude.\u201d\n\u201cI think people would be surprised how infrequently people have great attitudes,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it makes a big difference.\u201d\nThe reason why Jassy thinks positivity determines success is pretty straightforward: People want to be around positive people.\n\u201cYou pick up advocates and mentors much more quickly,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople want those people to succeed\u2014and it's very controllable.\u201d\nBut a cheerful disposition alone won\u2019t get you far, Jassy warned\u2014aspirational workers need to follow through on a can-do attidude with action.\n\u201cDo you work hard? Do you do what you said you were going to do?\u201d he asked.\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that once you\u2019ve climbed the ranks, it\u2019s now your turn to impart knowledge onto others. But Jassy warned that your enthusiasm for learning mustn\u2019t end in your twenties\u2014or when you reach management.\n\u201cThe biggest difference between the people I started with in my early stages of my career and what they're doing now has to do with how great they were at learning,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere are some people who get to a certain point and it almost feels threatening to them to learn,\u201d Jassy pointed out, adding that it can highlight gaping holes in your knowledge and make you question whether you're worthy of your rank.\n\u201cBut the second you think you know it all is the second you're really starting to unwind.\u201d\nIt\u2019s why he\u2019s a fan of a squiggly career that lets you stretch your abilities and try on many different roles and industries for size.\n\u201cAlong the way, you'll keep picking things up if you let yourself,\u201d Jassy concluded. \u201cYou'll wind your way around something that you're really good at.\u201d\nBefore entering the world of work, Jassy revealed that he was an aspiring athlete. The multimillionaire told Roslansky that he spent \u201ca lot\u201d of his school time on the field playing \u201call the sports,\u201d instead of keeping his head down and studying.\n\u201cI had this delusion that maybe I could be a professional athlete,\u201d he revealed. \u201cI played that national tennis circuit and then I played soccer competitively\u2014and of course, I wasn't good enough to be a professional athlete, so I'm not.\u201d\nAlthough Jassy failed at realizing his sporting dreams, the success he enjoys today could be thanks, in part, to the years he dedicated on the pitch. An extensive study of U.S. Ivy League alumni has shown those who are consumed with sports\u2014not books\u2014in their youth go on to become more successful than their peers later on in life.\nThe researchers found that sporty students were significantly more likely to land finance or business-related jobs after college, with more senior positions and high salaries than nonathletic students.\nJassy might not have known it at the time, but the research suggests that while dedicating his spare time to competing in soccer\u2014which often relies on teamwork, communication, and accountability\u2014he was banking skills fit for the boardroom.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge ruled Wednesday that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy violated federal labor laws for making comments emphasizing some downsides of unionization in select media appearances in 2022.\nIn the ruling, Judge Brian Gee identified statements made by Jassy on CNBC\u2019s television program \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d and during two summits organized by Bloomberg News and The New York Times, all of which included comments that touched on unionization efforts at the tech titan. \nMore from Sourcing Journal\nAmazon Teamsters, Labor Groups Back Legislators' New Warehouse Safety Bill\nAmazon Sets Delivery Speed Records-And Sees Higher Margins\nAmazon Employees in Alabama Could Get a Third Unionization Vote\nThe April 2022 \u201cSquawk Box\u201d interview saw Jassy posit that unionization would make employees less empowered.\n\u201cFirst, at a place like Amazon that empowers employees, if they see something they can do better for customers or for themselves, they can go meet in a room, decide how [to] change it and change it,\u201d Gee said. \u201cThat type of empowerment doesn\u2019t happen when you have unions. It\u2019s much more bureaucratic, it\u2019s much slower.\u201d\nJassy\u2019s comments at both the Bloomberg Technology Summit in June that year, and at The New York Times DealBook Summit in November, also alluded to bureaucracy.\n\u201cIf you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can\u2019t just go to your manager and say, \u2018Let\u2019s change it,\u2019\u201d Jassy said at the Bloomberg event. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole process and bureaucracy which you have to go through to be able to do that.\u201d\nAt DealBook, he lamented how Amazon employees \u201cdon\u2019t have to go through a union. It\u2019s not bureaucratic, it\u2019s not slow. We think that that\u2019s pretty empowering and a great way to work.\u201d\nIn the CNBC and Bloomberg interviews, Jassy did specify that employees do get to make the choice of whether they want to join a union.\n\u201cEmployees could have reasonably understood Jassy to be saying that, without a union, they would be more empowered and could achieve improvements at work faster and with less bureaucracy\u2014two assertions unsupported by objective fact\u2014and thus be better off,\u201d Gee wrote. \u201cI thus conclude that Jassy\u2019s words relied on coercion to dissuade employees from supporting unions.\u201d\nThe NLRB filed the complaint against Amazon and Jassy in October 2022.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree that any part of these comments were inappropriate and intend to appeal,\u201d said Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis in a statement. \u201cThe decision reflects poorly on the state of free speech rights today, and we remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to engage in a reasonable discussion on these issues where all perspectives have an opportunity to be heard.\u201d\nDespite the ruling, Jassy himself will not be penalized for the comments. The agency lacks the authority to hold executives personally liable for violations, impose penalties for unfair labor practices or make companies pay punitive damages.\nJudge Gee ordered Amazon to post a notice of employee rights at all its U.S. facilities nationwide, email the notice and post it on the employer\u2019s intranet.\nAccording to the ruling, such a notice would read, in part, that Amazon \u201cwill not threaten you by saying that you would be less empowered if you unionized, that you would find it harder to get things done quickly since unions are slower and more bureaucratic, and that you would be better off without a union.\u201d\nThe judge recommends Amazon be ordered to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from making such comments in the future.\nRulings by NLRB judges can be appealed to labor board members in Washington, D.C., and from there into federal court. Parties have 28 days from Wednesday to file exceptions with the board. If parties don\u2019t appeal, the judge\u2019s order will be adopted.\nJassy\u2019s slate of comments came after Amazon workers at a warehouse in Staten Island, N.Y. voted to unionize in April 2022, which marked the first successful unionization effort ever for employees at the e-commerce giant.\nAmazon has continued to contest the Staten Island unionization vote and still hasn\u2019t recognized the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), leaving the organized employees without a contract. The NLRB has previously said it found merit to the charges that Amazon violated labor laws by refusing to bargain with the ALU.\nThe NLRB is also currently hosting a hearing with Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) to determine whether employees at a Bessemer, Ala. warehouse will be able to vote for unionization for a third time.\nOver in the U.K., warehouse workers in Coventry, England won the right to hold a unionization vote last month. The timing of that ballot will be known in the coming weeks.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon AMZN is constantly gaining traction among sports clients on the back of its robust cloud services portfolio.This is evident from the latest five-year agreement between Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) and FWD Group Holdings Limited (\u201cFWD\u201d). The agreement is the extension of the latter\u2019s cloud technology collaboration with AWS.This highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.Per the agreement, AWS has become the strategic cloud provider of FWD. In order to support its cloud-first strategy, FWD intends to leverage AWS\u2019s cloud computing capabilities, agility and scalability.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nThe latest move of FWD has added strength to AWS\u2019s customer base.AWS\u2019s concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.Recently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter\u2019s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.CrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CrowdStrike aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.In addition, Brightcove started using Amazon\u2019s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media, and entertainment technology sectors.BlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cyber security operations.Zilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter\u2019s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.We believe that AWS\u2019s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.The strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.AMZN has gained 20.3% year to date.\nWe believe that AWS\u2019s growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.Microsoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported solid financial results for the first quarter on April 30. Revenue grew 13% over the year-ago quarter, and solid cost controls provided a massive boost to the company's profits.\nAfter the report came out, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintained an overweight (buy) rating on the shares but increased the price target from $215 to $220, representing upside of 23% above the current share price.\nHere's what's going right for Amazon, and why the stock could hit a new high in the next few years, if not sooner.\nManagement is generating enormous upside for Amazon's profitability by more efficiently allocating inventory across its network of fulfillment centers and squeezing more efficiency out of capital spending. These efforts led to a net profit of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, a big jump from $3.2 billion a year ago.\nFollowing the massive improvement on the bottom line, Morgan Stanley raised its forward estimates for operating income and earnings per share by about 10%. While the firm estimates that Amazon's North American retail business is still not profitable when excluding advertising revenue, which grew 24% year over year, it sees further upside for Amazon's profits from further cost efficiencies and accelerating growth in the high-margin Amazon Web Services cloud business.\nIt's not unreasonable to expect the share price to hit a new high. At $220, the shares would trade at 27 times trailing cash from operations per share, which would still be in the middle of the previous 10-year range for this valuation metric.\nConsidering the value underneath the shares, Amazon still looks like a great buy even after the run over the last year.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

This payout is part of the enforcement actions taken against the company for failing to adequately safeguard user privacy.\nThe FTC's enforcement actions follow a $5.8 million fine levied against Ring in May 2023 for significant privacy violations.\nEmployees and contractors of Ring had accessed customer video feeds without authorization, and these feeds were improperly used to train machine learning algorithms.\nDon't Miss:\nStartup behind \u2018the #1 free contractor app' grows 162% YoY, opens its doors for investors at a $100 minimum.\nInvest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women\u2019s health problem at 80 cents per share.\nThis lack of privacy controls led to severe personal intrusions, including spying and harassment of customers by both employees and external hackers.\n\"Ring's disregard for privacy and security exposed consumers to spying and harassment,\" said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The FTC's order makes clear that putting profit over privacy doesn't pay.\nThe privacy lapses at Ring included alarming incidents where employees viewed highly private videos, such as those capturing female users in bedrooms and bathrooms, without detection by the company's internal controls.\nTrending: Invest like a millionaire.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 7, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Amazon.com AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Zscaler ZS, Alaska Air Group ALK and DocuSign DOCU.\nIt is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality.\nIn this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Amazon.com, NVIDIA, Zscaler,Alaska Air Group and DocuSign as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it apparently looks good) doesn\u2019t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company\u2019s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\nOn the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies\u2019 financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company\u2019s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company\u2019s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors\u2019 dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company\u2019s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\nA handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only nine.\nHere are five out of nine stocks:\nAmazon.com: The Zacks Rank #2 company is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nAmazon's online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by its massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. The average earnings surprise of AMZN for the past four quarters is 48.17%.\nNVIDIA: The Zacks Rank #2 company is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.\nOver the years, NVIDIA\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms. The average earnings surprise of NVDA for the past four quarters is 20.18%.\nZscaler: The company is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of cloud-based security solutions. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nZscaler offers a full range of enterprise network security services, including web security, Internet security, antivirus, vulnerability management, firewalls, and control over user activity in mobile, cloud computing, and Internet of things environments.

        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of Top 10\u00a0AI Stocks for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\nBefore analyzing the stock, let's first see David Tepper's latest returns and his investing strategy for 2024.\nBillionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.\nDavid Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn\u2019t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\u201cGoing into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short\u2014I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cIt was very cool.\u201d Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn\u2019t do as well. \u201cI still got a raise but not as much as I should have.\u201d\nBillionaire David Tepper Q1'2024 Stake Value: $690,494,640\nBillionaire David Tepper owns a $690 million stake in Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0as of the end of the first quarter of 2024.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Over the last year or so, many technology companies have made a splash in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft really kicked things off following an investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. For a brief moment, it looked like Microsoft may have outmaneuvered its big tech peers.\nHowever, e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has started to emerge as formidable competitor in the AI realm. Let's dig into what Amazon is doing to accelerate its business, and explore why now is an incredible opportunity to scoop up shares.\nThe macroeconomy has faced some stark challenges over the last couple of years, with unusually high inflation and rising interest rates impacting businesses and consumers. Unfortunately, Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing operations are not immune to these measures, and the company's financial results undermine that.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2023, Amazon's free cash flow on a trailing-12-month basis stood at a negative $3.3 billion. Indeed, the chart illustrates the magnitude of Amazon's cash burn during periods of peak inflation and decelerating growth.\nHowever, fast-forward a year, and the narrative has changed dramatically. For the trailing-12-month period ended March 31, Amazon's free cash flow was $50.1 billion. Since bottoming out last spring, Amazon has turned its ship around and consistently generated positive cash flow. One of the big contributors to this turnaround is some acceleration in the cloud business in particular.\nWhat has Amazon been doing to jump-start its cloud services? Similar to Microsoft, Amazon has made some notable moves of its own in AI.\nBack in September, Amazon announced that it was investing $4 billion into an AI start-up called Anthropic. Interestingly, Anthropic's co-founders originally came from OpenAI. Per the terms of the deal, Anthropic agreed to primarily use Amazon's cloud infrastructure -- Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nThis is a subtle, yet lucrative, component of the partnership with Anthropic because it should help lead to new sources of lead generation for AWS. Furthermore, Anthropic will also be training future versions of its generative AI models using Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips. I see this as another savvy move by Amazon.\nAt the moment, the AI chip market is dominated by Nvidia. And while Nvidia will likely continue owning considerable market share, Amazon's investments in developing its own chips and data centers could unlock further gains in the cloud business over the long run.\nI think many investors are overlooking Amazon's progress and are thinking too narrowly as it pertains to the macroeconomy. The current inflation rate of 3.5% is well above the Federal Reserve's long-term target rate of 2%. However, it's important to understand just how much inflation has cooled compared to peak levels two years ago.\nThe chart paints an interesting picture. Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio reached a 10-year high back in 2020. However, not long after, the company's P/S ratio began sliding dramatically as inflation started soaring. Now, as inflation begins to cool, Amazon's P/S multiple appears to be normalizing.\nWhat I find fascinating about the dynamics in the chart is that even though Amazon's valuation multiples are rising, they are far from prior highs. On top of all of that, Amazon's P/S ratio is the lowest among the \"Magnificent Seven\" peer set. Considering how much Amazon has grown and redefined itself as an AI behemoth over the last couple of years, I think now is an opportunity to buy some shares at a discount.\nI think the growth narrative surrounding Amazon is clear. The company is in early stages of AI development, but it's already making major strides. Given the company's robust operating picture and dominant position in both e-commerce and cloud software, I'm encouraged by Amazon's momentum and am bullish they can keep it up.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Alice Nunwick ",
        "Text": "Amazon has received approval from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to expand its drone flights to more locations.\nThe FAA has given Amazon approval to fly its delivery drones beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) after Amazon created a BVLOS flight strategy.\nMost drones in the US are usually only allowed to be flown under close human supervision. However the tech giant's new BVLOS strategy will allow Amazon to fly its drone out of the controller's visual line of sight, meaning that the company can deliver to customers further away.\nAmazon said it had received permission from the FAA after submitting its engineering information, in a statement published today (30 May).\nAmazon also conducted flights in front of the FAA to demonstrate how its drone detect-and-avoid software worked in the presence of real planes and helicopters.\nThe tech giant said its pilots will be actively monitoring and controlling its drones with other tracking technology while they are out of sight.\nAmazon previously received an Air Carrier Certificate from the FAA in 2020, which enabled it to begin delivering small parcels via drone.\nFollowing its recent FAA approval, Amazon aims to roll out drone delivery to Prime customers in more densely populated areas.\nBy the end of 2024, Amazon stated that it hoped to deliver over 500 million parcels to Prime customers via drone.\nIt stated that safety would continue to be a priority in the expansion of its drone flight service.\nIn its 2022 thematic intelligence report into drones, research and analysis company GlobalData forecast that the global drone market could reach a value of $89.9bn by 2030.\n\"Amazon gets FAA approval to fly drones out of line of sight\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "E-commerce giant Shein is spreading its arms to envelope more than just the fashion and apparel for which it\u2019s known\u2014and it\u2019s starting to look like another familiar online market platform in the process.\nShein is wooing brands such as household goods conglomerate Colgate-Palmolive, toy maker Hasbro, and skincare brands to sell their products in its marketplace, Reuters reported Tuesday. The company, known for affordable and stylish clothes\u2014albeit made with concerns about labor practices and its environmental impact\u2014is taking steps to create a platform that is everything to everyone.\n\"Everybody associates Shein with fashion, but we are doing all verticals,\" Christina Fontana, Shein\u2019s senior director of brand operations for Europe, Middle East and Africa, said at a Paris conference on April 17, according to Reuters.\n\"Our consumers want brands, [so] if that's what they're looking for, that's what we're going to give them,\u201d she added.\nShein\u2019s outward expansion is a clear tactic to take a bigger piece of the e-commerce pie, Steve Tadelis, economic analysis and policy professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told Fortune.\nShein has the largest fast-fashion market share in the U.S, and its annual profit doubled to $2 billion in 2023 from the year before. It's eyeing an IPO and a whopping $90 billion valuation. While the size of its retail empire still pales in comparison to Amazon\u2019s stranglehold on 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market, Tadelis said Shein will want to go after the industry leader.\n\u201cIt shouldn't be surprising that with all of the regulators around the world and talking about the Amazon monopoly that needs to be reined in, well, Shein is now taking a bite out of their apple and will probably take more of those bites,\u201d he said.\nShein, a China-based fast-fashion platform founded by billionaire Sky Xu in 2008, has skyrocketed to success and 45 million monthly users through its massive and efficient production and distribution strategies.\nUsing AI and electronic monitoring, Shein is able to identify online trends, turn to its suppliers to manufacture small batches of products, then take initial sales data to decide to mass produce a product. The system nearly guarantees the company has its finger on the pulse of trends and can deliver goods fast, though it\u2019s gotten into hot water over allegations of copyright infringement and data scraping, as well as the proliferation of counterfeit product listings.\nEven as regulatory bodies, like the European Union\u2019s European Commission, have tried to put checks and balances on the company to stymie its questionable business practices, Shein may have found a way around that.\nJohn Deighton, professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School, told Fortune that Shein\u2019s strategy of incorporating more brand names onto its platform will only help the company dodge increased attention: The site could soon be flooded with thousands of listings from familiar and trusted products, such as Colgate toothpaste and Play-Doh, essentially telling regulatory bodies there\u2019s nothing to see here.\n\u201cThey won't get caught up by the scrutiny,\u201d Deighton said.\nShein\u2019s behind-the-scenes methodology makes expanding beyond fashion a natural next step, Tadelis argued. With an efficient infrastructure in place, Shein is able to be more nimble in expanding outward from apparel.\n\u201cI really think this is a smart business decision of saying, \u2018We have an amazing logistics network, let's start expanding it into other areas where we could procure cheap products,\u2019\u201d he added.\nRui Ma, tech analyst and COO of market research platform AlphaWatch.AI, told Fortune that Shein\u2019s secure spot in apparel offers another advantage in its race to beat Amazon. Fashion is a notoriously finicky sector, and Amazon, despite dipping its toe into the world of apparel, hasn\u2019t been able to see the same success as Shein, Ma said.\n\u201cIt's been very\u2014historically\u2014very difficult to match up demand supply,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not been a particularly easy category.\u201d\nBut as Shein takes pages out of Amazon\u2019s playbook, Amazon is simultaneously doing the same to Shein. Amazon announced last December it would slash seller fees from 17% to 5% for apparel under $15, with apparel between $15 to $20 triggering a 10% fee, starting in January. The company said on Monday its packages are getting delivered faster than ever: 60% of orders placed in 60 major U.S. cities arrived the same day or day after the order was placed. According to the company, that's part of its longstanding efforts to stay on top of the e-commerce market and tend to customer needs. Shein customers may have to wait 14 days for their orders to arrive.\nTadelis believes this is par for the course. Just as in most markets, company philosophies start to converge on each other when one finds an effective formula.\n\u201cThere's no surprise that these things are looking more alike,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause once there's a good, winning strategy \u2026 then you're going to see imitators.\u201d\nFor the consumer, there will certainly appear to be copycatting and similarities in promotions and perks across e-commerce platforms. But Ma said, don\u2019t be fooled by Shein\u2019s bid to mime its competitors. The site might start to look a lot like Amazon in its offerings, but behind the scenes, it\u2019s very much sticking with its unique logistics network.\n\u201cIt might feel the same to us as consumers. It's going to become more of an everything store,\u201d she told Fortune. \u201cBut how it builds that experience, I think the logic is very different from Amazon.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

The startup uses an army of contract workers to clean and label the vast amount of text, images and assorted data that\u2019s needed to develop AI chatbots and other products. Scale also employs a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which incorporates input from real people to refine the performance of AI systems.\nScale works with many of the largest AI companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. The startup also has contracts with the US government and is working with the Pentagon\u2019s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to develop a testing and evaluation framework for AI models used by the military.\n\u201cOur vision is one of data abundance, where we have the means of production to continue scaling frontier LLMs many more orders of magnitude,\u201d Alexandr Wang, Scale\u2019s founder and chief executive officer, said in the announcement. \u201cWe should not be data-constrained in getting to GPT-10,\u201d he said.\nWang may not be a household name to the same degree as OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, but he has gradually established himself as a key figure in the industry. He has testified before Congress about America\u2019s risk of falling behind China in the AI race and serves as a connector of sorts between the defense and tech industries. Earlier this month, Wang traveled to Capitol Hill to speak at the Hill & Valley Forum, an event sponsored by a group of VCs including the Peter Thiel-backed Founders Fund, where Wang emphasized the importance of not underestimating China as a competitor to the US in AI.\nScale is positioning itself as a critical supplier of high-quality data at a time when artificial intelligence developers \u2014 which have already scraped the internet for images, text and other information \u2014 are grappling with the prospect of running out of it to train their models. In a blog post, Scale said it plans to use the fresh capital to provide the \u201cdata that will pave the road for AGI,\u201d referring to artificial general intelligence, a powerful form of AI that doesn\u2019t yet exist.\nWhile many other AI startups were swept up in a funding frenzy over the past 18 months following the launch of ChatGPT, Scale was slower to jump into the fray, quietly building its roster of corporate customers.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.13 = US$47b \u00f7 (US$531b - US$153b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThus, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 11%.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com  for free.\nWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 13% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 230% in that time. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.\nTo sum it up, Amazon.com has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 104% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\nWhile Amazon.com doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our  FREE intrinsic value estimation for AMZN  on our platform.\nWhile Amazon.com isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "This Will Be Amazon's Next Big Move",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have more than doubled since the start of 2023. That makes the e-commerce giant one of the best-performing stocks on Wall Street. \nYet, the question investors should be asking now is: What's next for Amazon?\nTo answer that question, we have to look at Amazon's business by the numbers. So, let's dive in.\nAmazon is a huge company. Over the last 12 months, the company generated $590 billion in revenue across multiple business divisions. Each of these segments benefits the overall company in its own way. However, there's no doubt about it: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's crown jewel.\nLaunched in 2006, AWS is the world's largest cloud services business. The division now generates over $100 billion in annual revenue. To put this figure in context, AWS' total sales are now higher than those of PepsiCo, Walt Disney, and Nvidia. Furthermore, if AWS were a stand-alone, publicly traded company, it would be the 36th largest company in the S&P 500 by revenue -- with revenue roughly equal to Tesla.\nAWS is gigantic, and its importance to Amazon can hardly be understated. This is why Amazon's next big move revolves around AWS.\nIt's true: AWS is the biggest cloud services provider. Indeed, recent estimates place AWS atop the list of global cloud providers, with a 31% market share, followed by Microsoft's Azure (25%) and Alphabet's Google Cloud (11%). \nYet, this snapshot doesn't tell the whole picture. As recently as 2022, AWS held a 33% market share compared to Azure's 22%. In other words, Azure is closing the gap on AWS.\nPerhaps in response to this, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy recently announced a shake-up at AWS. Current AWS CEO Adam Selipsky will step down in June. He will be replaced by Matt Garman.\nIn addition to the leadership change, the company is ramping up spending, as the battle for AI dominance heats up. In last month's earnings call, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said this: \n\"We will be meaningfully stepping up our CapEx and the majority of that will be...to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts...In Q1, we had $14 billion of CapEx. We expect that to be the [lowest] quarter of the year.\"\nAmazon's next big move is to ramp up spending on AWS to fight off the challenge from Azure. In the short term, that will reduce the company's free cash flow, as its capex spending rises. It could be a risky move, as it's not a given that the increased spending will boost the company's cloud services market share. \nAmazon, however, has executed similar strategies well in the past, most recently during the pandemic, as it invested heavily in its distribution network -- an investment that is now paying off by reducing delivery times thanks to its increased regionalization.\nAt any rate, it's clear that Amazon management is taking the challenge from Microsoft (and others) seriously. As a shareholder, that's what I want to see from management -- a willingness to change course before a concern becomes a crisis. And it's another reason why Amazon remains a solid long-term investment in my view.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Jeff Bezos revealed his secret to Amazon\u2019s success 25 years ago: \u2018I asked everyone around here to wake up terrified every morning, their sheets drenched in sweat\u2019",
        "Author": "  Chloe Berger ",
        "Text": "Back in the 90s, Jeff Bezos went on record as hoping his employees would wake up on the wrong side of the bed\u2014for the greater good, or for the customer at the very least.\nToday marks the anniversary of when the former online bookstore went public in 1997 with an original IPO price of $18 per share, catapulting Bezos into millionaire status almost immediately. Now, Amazon shares are going for $185.99 each as of market close, Bezos is worth more than $200 billion, and the company sells almost everything under the sun (including, but really not limited, to books).\nA quarter of a century ago, in 1999, when Bezos was CEO, he revealed his nascent hard-line leadership strategy with CNET's Wendy Walsh. Two years after Amazon first went public, Bezos was already a billionaire, sharing his take on what built his booming e-commerce business. Praising his employees for being \u201cthe hardest working, most talented, most passionate, most customer-focused,\u201d group of people, Bezos really hammered home the customer-service part.\nTaking it a step further than satisfaction guaranteed, he seemingly suggested that if workers aren\u2019t waking up in abject fear of disturbing their customer base, then they\u2019re doing it wrong. \u201cI asked everyone around here to wake up terrified every morning, their sheets drenched in sweat,\u201d he said. The purported goal was not to have a dehydrated Silicon Valley office staff, but to ensure that no one rests on their laurels.\nOf course, he implored employees \u201cto be very precise about what it is they\u2019re afraid of,\u201d instead of waking up in wet sheets for the sake of it, presumably.\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be afraid of our competitors; they should be afraid of our customers because those are the folks we have a relationship with,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cThose are the folks who send us money,\u201d he added.\nIn the interview, Bezos noted that things could always change on a dime for Amazon.com. Recognizing that the company wasn\u2019t long-lasting yet, it could \u201cstill lose our whole opportunity to make that little bit of history\u201d if they don\u2019t \u201cfocus obsessively on the customer.\u201d\nBezos\u2019 fixation on his clients is not unlike an unrequited crush, fueled by the knowledge of the other playing hard to get or being temperamental. \u201cI believe that our customers are loyal to us right up until the second that somebody else offers them better service,\u201d he said. Even the current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has spoken about Bezos\u2019 demands of his workers.\n\u201cWatching Jeff, I have never seen anybody with higher standards,\u201d Jassy said at Fortune\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos this year.\nThis esteeming of the customer appears to come at a price, or at least some controversy. Some workers have called Bezos and Amazon out for harsh conditions. Bezos\u2019 mindset has since come under fire as his company and net worth grew. In 2015, the New York Times released an explosive feature regarding the high standards at Amazon which included, at times, working past midnight, a tense company culture, and simply a lack of work-life balance for the sake of a high salary and belief in the mission.\nYears later, in 2023, three Amazon drivers filed a class action lawsuit against the company as they claimed they went through \u201cinhumane conditions\u201d and were unable to stop work in order to use the bathroom. Issues continue within the warehouses, as The U.S. Department of Labor announced in the same year that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found workers were exposed to hazardous conditions.\n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned about profit,\u201d Michael Verrastro, a former Amazon warehouse worker, told The Guardian in regards to employee safety.\nIn Bezos\u2019 words, they\u2019re concerned about the customer.\nAmazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a07 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.\nSince Amazon is part of Loeb's top large-cap stock picks, the stock deserves a detailed look. But first let's see the latest performance of the billionaire.\nActivist investor and billionaire Dan Loeb made a comeback in the final quarter of 2023 after losing money during most of the year in addition to suffering losses in 2022. Wall Street Journal earlier this year reported that Loeb\u2019s Third Point, which he founded in 1995, gained between 7.8% to 8.6% in the December quarter. Third Point was also down 21% in 2022. Third Point was a star performer in the pandemic year as the fund closed 2020 up 19%, as Loeb foresaw the economy doing much better than many had expected.\nLoeb's Q1'2024 Returns and Performance\nLoeb is known for his activist bets in high-profile companies Intel, Disney and Shell. Some of his bets were highly unsuccessful, while others paid off. Latest data shows Loeb is continuing to retain the Q4'2023 momentum into 2024. In his Q1 letter to investors, Loeb revealed that Third Point returned 7.8% in the flagship Offshore Fund.\nLoeb said in his Q1 letter that he's in the \"soft landing camp\" as he believes we are no longer in an inflationary environment. He's also highly bullish on AI, saying the technology favors the \"incumbents\" who are deploying massive cash \"war chests\" to win the \"AI arms race,\" a term the billionaire used twice in his letter. Loeb is betting on the whole AI spectrum \u2014 semiconductors, data centers, AI software and power.\n\"We shared our views on AI\u2019s transformational potential in recent letters and it is a key element of the thesis for nearly half of our equity positions today. Unlike in past periods of technological paradigm shifts, this new technology favors incumbents who are deploying their financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race. Right now, what we see as the best-run \u201clegacy\u201d companies like Microsoft and Amazon (both of which we own) have built enormous competitive advantages and seen their growth vectors accelerate. Below, we discuss London Stock Exchange Group, Alphabet and TSMC, positions whose catalysts for further value creation are primarily \u201cAI-driven\u201d. We also see the energy transition and growth in data centers affecting scores of industrial, materials and energy companies as demand for infrastructure and certain commodities surges.\"\nFor this article we scanned Third Point\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top large-cap stock holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nBillionaire Dan Loeb\u00a0Q1'2024 Stake Value: $919,938,000\nBillionaire Dan Loeb increased his position in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) by 22% during the first quarter, ending the period with a $920 million stake. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nHowever, Amazon skeptics believe the stock has run too much as its valuation is high. For value-conscious investors the market is indeed teeming with other opportunities.

A total of 302 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN).\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d\nAmazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st\u00a0in Insider Monkey\u2019s list of the\u00a07 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

The company\u2019s first quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance.Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings remain tailwinds.Amazon\u2019s expanding global presence remains a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Additionally, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)Visa\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the year-to-date period (+7.6% vs. +5.4%).

Nonetheless, Pfizer expects better non-COVID operational revenue growth in the future quarters, driven by its in-line products like Vyndaqel and Prevnar, new launches like Abrysvo, Velsipity, Penbraya and newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen.Huge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which saw its share price drive 111% higher over five years.\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nOver half a decade, Amazon.com managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 16% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 50.30, the market remains optimistic.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nIt's good to see that Amazon.com has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 50% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 16% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before deciding if you like the current share price, check how Amazon.com scores on these 3 valuation metrics.\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "MONTR\u00c9AL, May 13, 2024 /CNW/ - For the first time in Canada, there is a union at an Amazon warehouse. In a decision handed down on Friday, the Administrative Labour Tribunal (ALT) certified the Laval Amazon Workers Union\u2014CSN.\nAfter conducting an investigation pursuant to the Labour Code, the ALT determined that a majority of employees at the DXT4 warehouse had chosen to join the union in order to negotiate their first collective agreement. The decision is enforceable and Amazon will be legally required to come to the bargaining table.\n\"First and foremost, this is a great victory for the men and women from Latin America, Chad, the Maghreb and Asia who were not afraid to stand up for their rights,\" says CSN President Caroline Senneville. \"Over the past few months, Amazon has pulled out all the stops to block our unionization campaign, flooding the workplace with scaremongering messages. DXT4 workers have given us all a lesson in courage. Of course, we hope it spreads.\"\nOn April 19, the CSN filed an application with the ALT to represent the 200 employees at Amazon's DXT4 warehouse on Ernest-Cormier St. in Laval. In the preceding weeks, many workers had signed union cards.\nAmazon workers cite many reasons for dissatisfaction with their working conditions: the frenetic pace of work, woefully inadequate health and safety measures, and wages well below the norm at warehouses and fulfillment centres in Qu\u00e9bec.\nAmazon plans to appeal\nOn May 6, even before the ALT decision, Amazon's recently retained lawyers announced they intend to challenge the constitutionality of section 28 of the Qu\u00e9bec Labour Code. In a letter to the ALT, the CSN and the Attorney General, Amazon claims that the ALT's authority to certify a union as the workers' representative is contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it violates the workers' right to freedom of association by potentially depriving them of the right to choose their representatives!\n\"It's been clear from the outset: Amazon has never wanted to abide by the legal framework governing labour relations in Qu\u00e9bec,\" says Caroline Senneville. \"Now, Amazon is actually asking for the Labour Code to be suspended while it clogs the courts with motions in a last-ditch effort to prevent its employees from joining together to improve their lot. But an American multinational can't come in and dictate our laws. We have full confidence in our judicial system and have no doubt that it will find that our Labour Code is consistent with the Charter, no matter what Amazon says.\"\nIn the coming days, the union will hold its first general assembly to adopt its constitution and bylaws and elect its representatives. It will then launch a consultation with its members to prepare its list of demands. Under the Qu\u00e9bec Labour Code, Amazon will be legally required to negotiate.\nMore information on the drive to organize Amazon workers in Qu\u00e9bec: https://sesyndiquer.org/mawu/english/\nFounded in 1921, the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des syndicats nationaux (CSN) represents 330,000 workers in the public and parapublic sectors in all regions of Qu\u00e9bec and across Canada.\nSOURCE CSN\nView original content: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2024/13/c4672.html\n"

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been one of the hottest mega-cap stocks on the market. Its shares have soared nearly 20% year to date and are up more than 70% over the last 12 months.\nThe company revealed in its first-quarter update on Tuesday that it plans to increase capital expenditures in the coming quarters. Does this increased spending diminish Amazon's prospects? Nope. Here's why it makes the stock an even better buy.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy stated in the company's Q1 conference call that capital expenditures would \"meaningfully increase year over year\" in 2024 to support growth for its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), especially in generative AI. CFO Brian Olsavsky noted that capex in Q1 was $14 billion. He said that's likely to be the lowest quarterly level this year. With 2023 capex totaling $48.4 billion, Amazon will increase its capital expenditures by at least 16%.\nInvestors reacted negatively to Meta Platforms' similar announcement in its Q1 update that it planned to boost capex because of its focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and metaverse initiatives. However, Amazon projected higher spending, and its shares rose. Why? I think there are two reasons.\nFirst, Amazon generates more than enough free cash flow to afford the higher capex. The company's free cash flow topped $50 billion over the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2024. That's a huge improvement from the outflow of $3.3 billion for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2023.\nSecond, investors believe Amazon's capex investments will pay off. They know that history is on their side. As Olsavsky noted in the Q1 call, when Amazon has increased capex for AWS in the past, it has benefited from increased revenue, operating income, and free cash flow for a long time afterward.\nDeepwater Asset Management co-founder Doug Clinton recently told CNBC that investors shouldn't \"expect Amazon to be a major player\" in the AI model wars over the next three to five years. I don't take issue with that comment. However, don't read more into Clinton's remarks than he intended -- and don't underestimate Amazon's AI prospects.\nAmazon's strategy has been to offer customers more alternatives on AWS rather than push its own large language model (LLM), although it does have an in-house AI model. Notably, Amazon Bedrock allows customers to use Anthropic's Claude 3 LLM, which is arguably the best AI model available right now. Customers can also use Meta's Llama 3, several Mistral models, and Cohere's latest models.\nI like how Amazon makes it easy for organizations to train and deploy generative AI on AWS. If a customer wants to use Nvidia chips, AWS has, in Jassy's words, \"the broadest selection of Nvidia compute instances around.\" Want a more cost-effective alternative? AWS offers its own AI chips.\nAmazon's SageMaker dramatically improves productivity in building generative AI models. As two cases in point, Jassy noted in the Q1 call that SageMaker enables Perplexity AI to train its LLMs 40% faster and Workday to reduce inference latency by 80%. He also highlighted Custom Model Import, which allows customers to import AI models from SageMaker or other tools into Bedrock before deploying apps.\nPerhaps the most important recent example of Amazon's AI prowess is its launch of Amazon Q. This AI-powered tool generates and debugs software code. Jassy said that Q \"has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors and catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions.\" Impressive.\nI've viewed Amazon as a smart pick for quite a while. The company's cost-cutting initiatives are paying off nicely. It has new growth drivers, especially advertising.\nBut Amazon's investment in preparing AWS to handle greater generative AI demand makes me even more optimistic. I fully expect this investment to deliver significant returns. Amazon has been a great stock to buy. Now it's an even better one.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "A federal administrative law judge ruled that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy violated labor law by making certain anti-union comments during media interviews two years ago.\nThe ruling, issued Wednesday, follows a complaint filed in 2022 by the National Labor Relations Board that accused Jassy of crossing the line during sit-down interviews in which he said that workers were better off without a union.\nIn the ruling, National Labor Relations Board Judge Brian D. Gee pointed to statements Amazon\u2019s chief executive made on CNBC\u2019s television program \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d and during two summits organized by Bloomberg News and the New York Times.\nGee said predictions Jassy made about unionization changing the employee-employer relationship were lawful. But other statements about how employees would be less empowered under a union, \u201cfind it harder to get things done quickly and would be better off\u201d without one ran afoul of federal labor law, the judge said.\nIn a prepared statement, Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said the company strongly disagrees that \u201cany part of these comments\u201d were inappropriate and intends to appeal the ruling within the administrative law system.\n\u201cThe decision reflects poorly on the state of free speech rights today, and we remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to engage in a reasonable discussion on these issues where all perspectives have an opportunity to be heard,\u201d Paradis said.\nJassy\u2019s comments came amid increased unionization efforts at Amazon following a historic victory by the Amazon Labor Union during a union representation vote at a warehouse in New York City. The company has continued to appeal the union\u2019s win and refused to come to the bargaining table.\nIn his ruling, Gee advised Amazon to avoid \u201cthreatening its employees\u201d with similar comments in the future and to post a notice in its facilities nationwide that signaled the company's compliance with the judge\u2019s finding.\n"

        "Author": "  Diane Brady, Nicholas Gordon ",
        "Text": "Good morning.\nWhen John Mackey wrote about \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d in 2013, he didn\u2019t get much push-back. The co-founder and former CEO of Whole Foods had long walked the walk when it came to living the values he espouses. He famously capped cash compensation at 19 times average worker pay and distributed stock options widely. (Equilar reports median CEO-to-worker pay ratio among the highest-paid 100 CEOs last year was close to 300 times median worker pay.)\nMackey is back with a new book The Whole Story, which publishes today. It\u2019s a reflection on how he built the natural foods chain from a single store in Austin in 1980 to a grocery giant that he sold to Amazon for $13.7 billion in 2017. He wanted to chronicle Whole Foods\u2019 history and convey what a fun and creative adventure building a business can be. It's \u201cnot just about making money,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's about the relationships and the team. It's about love and creating value together.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s ready to reexamine how conscious capitalism is faring today; \u201cit's misunderstood and being attacked on both sides,\u201d he says. \u201cShareholder capitalists are attacking it because they believe it's undermining the control of business by the owners \u2026 And anti-capitalists are trying to weaponize it to take power away from the investors and owners of the business to redistribute that power to other stakeholders.\u201d His goal: \u201cTo get people to see that business has potential for higher purpose; that all stakeholders matter.\u201d\nMackey is also reflecting on the deal that forever altered the business he'd built: Whole Foods\u2019 sale to Amazon. He says selling was the best option for Whole Foods since he was battling shareholder activist Jana Partners at the time. \u201cI'll always wonder if we had fought Jana Partners could we have won? But [Amazon has] been a good steward of the brand\u2026They let us drop our prices and they enabled Whole Foods to think long term.\u201d\nIn addition to his new book, Mackey is launching a new health and wellness company called Love.Life focused on democratizing wellness in the same way that Whole Foods gave consumers access to more natural and gourmet food.\n\u201cI found out at a pretty early age that the most important thing in life is love,\u201d says Mackey, who took over an old Best Buy in El Segundo, Calif., to build the first Love.Life center, due to open this summer. \u201cIf you have a lot of gratitude in your life and you have a lot of love, you're going to have a lot of joy and happiness.\u201d\nMore news below.\nDiane Bradydiane.brady@fortune.comFollow on LinkedIn\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-05-27, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $80.32. It's currently trading at a price of $180.75. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -125.04%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$3.64\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.47%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n21.45\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n9.12\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n80.32\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $54.92. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -229.12%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "Walmart makes the big-box retail business look easy. The Arkansas-based retailer long known as a discount store has not only retained its budget-hunting customer, but it\u2019s now also going after the wealthier crowd of competitors Target and Amazon.\nThe company reported 6% revenue growth to $161.5 billion and a comparable sales growth of 3.8% in its first quarter Thursday, which it said was driven by upper-income shoppers. Walmart was so optimistic it raised its outlook for growth to 4% from 3% for the year and expects adjusted earnings to be $2.37 per share, up from $2.23.\n\u201cWe are seeing customers trade into Walmart,\u201d Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told Bloomberg on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve historically been thought of for value, but now it\u2019s value, quality and convenience.\u201d\nWalmart attributed its growth to its 21% surge in e-commerce revenue, led by curbside pick-up and delivery orders\u2014a service typically favored by wealthier consumers looking for convenience. It also gained market share in groceries as consumers continue to stray from discretionary purchases in favor of just buying the essentials.\nCustomers making over $100,000 have contributed the most to Walmart\u2019s market share takeover, according to analyst Neil Saunders of GlobalData, and the retailer\u2019s strategies of late reflect its desire to keep that the case. In April, Walmart announced the release of the premium own-brand food line bettergoods, with a focus on bright packaging and plant-based items to appeal to Gen Z and bougie shoppers. Earlier this year the retailer remodeled and revamped 800 locations, stocking wider shelves with $50 silk sleep masks and $230 duck breast. The company plans to remodel 900 stores in 2024, CEO Doug McMillon said in the company\u2019s earnings presentation.\nThese tactics are on top of its consistent discount efforts, which McMillon said have been key to Walmart continuing to resonate with its consumer base\u2014particularly as consumer sentiment reaches a six-month low despite cooling inflation\u2014and have kept analysts upbeat on the company.\n\u201cDespite a volatile consumer spending backdrop, increased concerns on the health of the low-end consumer, and the relative resiliency of shares of [Walmart], we approach its [first quarter] print with optimism,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai wrote.\nWhile Walmart has moved to appeal to higher-income consumers, historically higher-income-focused Target has gone in the opposite direction as the company lags in sales. Regarded for its cheap-chic, Tar-jay reputation, the Minnesota retailer has pivoted to lower-income customers, launching in February its \u201cdealworthy\u201d budget brands with most items under $10. It\u2019s not an all-in endeavor for Target: The company also launched its own paid membership, Target Circle 360, mirroring Amazon Prime and Walmart+ efforts to tap into well-to-do customers looking for convenience.\nAmazon has made similar moves to compete with Walmart\u2019s e-commerce rally, introducing last month an unlimited grocery delivery service under $10 for Amazon Prime members, with the same service available for EBT cardholders without Prime for $4.99. Last July, Walmart rolled out Walmart+ Assist and cut the price of its paid membership in half for those receiving government assistance. Walmart\u2019s grocery delivery services eclipsed Amazon\u2019s since 2019, with Insider Intelligence predicting recently that Walmart orders will make up 26.9% of online grocery sales by the end of 2024, with Amazon making up 18.5%. While the big-box retailer has expanded to 4.4 billion units delivered in the past 12 months, Amazon Prime reported last month it delivered 4 billion items for same or next-day delivery in the U.S. in 2023.\nOther factors are keeping Walmart on top: The company grew its advertising business 24%, a venture with higher margins than retail. It laid off hundreds of its corporate staff earlier this week, relocating many remote employees to its Arkansas headquarters, a decision that came on the heels of its move to shutter all 51 of its health care clinics. Walmart decreased U.S. inventory 4.2% as an additional cost-cutting measure.\u00a0 But Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen, told Bloomberg in March that Walmart\u2019s real advantage lies in its potential to tap into customers across tax brackets.\n\u201cThis is about modernizing the brand and making it seem chic and cool,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWalmart is good at basics and wants to be known for more than that \u2014 and sell more than that.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Manali Pradhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. stock market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth over the past decade despite multiple economic challenges and geopolitical pressures. This environment has helped pave the way for high-growth companies such as Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft to reach the coveted trillion-dollar market capitalization.\nThese companies have demonstrated powerful and scalable business models, visionary management, and rapid organic and inorganic market expansion. Plus, these companies have quickly adopted technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing.\nOnly a few other companies share similar characteristics and may be next in line to cross the trillion-dollar market capitalization mark by 2030. Here's why Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) fits the bill and may soon join the trillion-dollar club.\nThe increasing demand for accelerated computing infrastructure and AI-driven data centers has been the major growth catalyst for Broadcom, especially for the networking business in the past couple of years. In fiscal 2024's first quarter, ended Feb. 4, Broadcom's AI revenue quadrupled year over year to $2.3 billion, offsetting the cyclical slowdown in other businesses. The company now expects AI-related revenue to account for almost 35% of its fiscal 2024 semiconductor revenue at $10 billion , up from its previous estimate of $8 billion.\nThis upward revision can be mainly attributed to the solid demand for its custom AI chips and networking solutions such as Tomahawk 5 800G switches, Ethernet, digital signal processing (DSP) platforms, and optical components by large-scale enterprises deploying AI data centers and hyperscale customers.\nBesides catering to enterprise AI demand, Broadcom's networking solutions are also used extensively in consumer-facing AI applications. In its fiscal Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted the strong demand for the company's custom AI chips at two hyperscalers .\nAlthough the company has not disclosed the names of these clients, many analysts have zeroed in on Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Since these clients own vast amounts of data and have a very large subscriber base, they stand to benefit dramatically from the use of custom AI chips in targeted areas such as search, SEO, and digital marketing. Since Broadcom seems to have cultivated deep, strategic, and multi-year relationships with these hyperscalers, it is well-positioned to develop custom AI chips catering to their specific needs.\nBroadcom has a proven track record of designing and manufacturing high-performance and energy-efficient custom AI chips as well as multiple AI-optimized networking components capable of handling complex workloads for foundational models and large language applications. Coupled with the company's long-term relationships with its clients and a supporting software ecosystem, Broadcom is poised to thwart competition from new players in the custom silicon space.\nThe acquisition of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions player VMware is also proving to be a major growth catalyst for Broadcom. In the first quarter, the company's infrastructure software revenue was up 153% year over year to $4.6 billion, with VMware contributing almost $2.1 billion during the 10.5 weeks of the quarter (as the acquisition was completed in November 2023).\nConsolidated software bookings grew nearly three times year over year to $1.8 billion in the first quarter and are expected to reach $3 billion in the second quarter. Broadcom expects revenue from the VMware portfolio to grow sequentially by a double-digit percentage every quarter throughout fiscal 2024.\nBroadcom's VMware strategy mainly involves upselling VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) to existing customers, especially those already running compute workloads with vSphere virtualization tools. VCF is a complete software stack, which includes computing, storage, and networking capabilities, and acts as an alternative and complement to the public cloud platforms for the customers' on-premise data centers.\nThe company is focusing on developing an improved VCF stack to sell to its largest 2,000 strategic customers, many of whom need a hybrid cloud solution (mix of private and public cloud infrastructure) for their on-premise distributed data centers. Broadcom has also partnered with Nvidia to form VMware Private AI Foundation, which enables VCF to run GPUs. This initiative is helping further drive demand for VCF.\nThe global virtualization software market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22.3% from $40 billion in 2023 to $300 billion in 2033. Broadcom seems well-poised to capitalize on this opportunity, thanks to the synergies between its software offerings and acquired VMware portfolio. The company expects its overall software revenue to be $20 billion in fiscal 2024, which will end Oct. 31.\nBroadcom's hardware and software offerings are used in multiple end markets including smartphones, telecommunications, and a variety of industrial applications. The diversified client base has made the overall business resilient since fluctuations in a few end markets can be partly offset by others.\nBroadcom shares are currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 16.6, significantly higher than their five-year average of 9.3. However, considering the company's ability to capitalize on the growing demand for accelerated computing and data center infrastructure across industries, this high valuation seems justified.\nThe company is poised to generate revenue of $50.2 billion in fiscal 2024. Assuming its P/S ratio remains constant (due to AI tailwinds), the company will have to grow its revenue to about $61 billion to support a $1 trillion market capitalization. This seems to be a very achievable target, since analysts are projecting Broadcom's revenue to grow to $62.8 billion by fiscal 2026.\nHence, it makes sense for long-term retail investors to consider buying at least a small stake in this AI-powered stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

The solid customer momentum of AWS is driving the company\u2019s top line. Shares of Amazon have rallied 20.4% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 index\u2019s growth of 12.7%.The latest partnership of a generative AI company called NinjaTech AI with AWS is a testament to the above-mentioned fact.The former launched the next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using AWS\u2019s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.Apart from these next-generation chips, NinjaTech AI is leveraging Amazon SageMaker in a bid to make training of the underlined AI agents fast, flexible and affordable.With the help of AWS cloud solutions, Ninja is capable of saving time and money by implementing generative AI in everyday workflows.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nNinjaTech AI\u2019s latest move highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS\u2019s innovative cloud products and services. Moreover, it has added strength to AWS\u2019s customer base.Both Trainium and Inferentia2 chips are designed to support the larger 70B variants of the latest popular open-source models like Llama 3. While Trainium chips help train Large Language Models at low costs by powering high-performance compute clusters on AWS, Inferentia2 chips enable models to generate inferences faster and at much lower costs.In addition to these chips, AWS recently introduced Amazon Bedrock innovations in order to bolster generative AI strength. These innovations include the latest custom model import capability and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails, which are designed to deliver easy, fast and secure ways to develop advanced generative AI applications and experiences.AWS also made its generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q generally available.AWS\u2019s growing efforts toward strengthening its portfolio offerings are likely to continue driving customer momentum. This, in turn, will continue to drive AWS\u2019s top-line growth in the near term and the long run.In first-quarter 2024, AWS sales (18% of the total sales) rose 17% year over year to $25.04 billion.Strengthening the AWS segment, in turn, will boost Amazon\u2019s overall financial performance.For second-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $148.54 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.5%.The same for earnings per share stands at $1.02, which indicates a year-over-year rise of 61.9%.\nAmazon\u2019s solidifying prospects in the promising cloud computing market are expected to continue providing a competitive advantage over its peers like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google, which are also gaining steam.Microsoft is continuously riding on strong momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business, driven by the solid adoption of Azure. Strength in Azure AI remains a positive. The company\u2019s strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI are noteworthy. Also, growth in AI Copilot is contributing well to Microsoft\u2019s cloud business.Meanwhile, Google Cloud, which has turned out to be the key catalyst for Alphabet\u2019s growth, is gaining from the growing generative AI capabilities, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace remains a major positive.\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Salesforce CRM, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The 2023 edition raised 13 billion euros ($14 billion) of foreign investment.\nThe French presidency said on Sunday that Amazon would announce an extra 1.2 billion euro investment in France which could create 3,000 new jobs, while healthcare companies Pfizer and AstraZeneca announced new investments worth a total of nearly $1 billion.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire added that Morgan Stanley, which plans to raise its overall headcount in Paris to 500 by 2025, was adding 100 staff in the French capital.\nMacron wants to burnish Paris' role as a top European business capital.

        "Author": "  Jordan Rosenfeld ",
        "Text": "On an episode of the Rachel Cruze Show, money expert Cruze discussed the 10 best Amazon products you can get for under $20 as recommended by influencer Kallie Branciforte from That Practical Mom (formerly But First, Coffee), a popular YouTube channel.\nCheck Out: 6 Best Expensive-Looking Things You Can Buy at Big Lots\nRead Next: How To Get $340 Per Year in Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You Already Buy\nBranciforte shared products that she not only thinks are cool but that she uses on a regular basis, all of which you can grab for low prices, many of them quite a bit less than $20.\nRead on to find out which of these ten products you\u2019ll want to jump on immediately.\nBranciforte\u2019s first favorite product is a silicone clip-on strainer that attaches to a pot or a bowl, making it unnecessary to break out a big, bulky strainer.\nShe said it\u2019s especially great for people who don\u2019t have big kitchens or a lot of storage, and it may reduce the likelihood of burning yourself with hot water.\nExplore More: The Single Best Thing To Buy at Costco When You\u2019re on an Extra Tight Budget\nFor people who do a lot of cooking and baking, a refillable oil mister saves time and waste. It also allows you to customize the kind of oil you spray on to your pots and pans.\nAdditionally, she pointed out that it\u2019s great for people with air fryers, which only require a tiny bit of oil, if any. This product is on sale for $10.87 but regularly retails for $16.99.\nBranciforte doesn\u2019t like the aesthetics of bright ugly sponges and prefers natural materials whenever possible. She recommended natural sponges and scrubbers, made from eco-friendly materials. A 14-pack of sponges is just $9.99, making it an excellent deal. And bamboo scrubbers come in a four-pack for $14.99.\nLaundry is often a logistical nightmare for anyone with a small home or with multiple people\u2019s laundry to tackle.\nAn over-the-door laundry hamper gets the laundry off the floor, but with an easy opening, and makes it plenty accessible to toss in dirty items in a heartbeat. Branciforte\u2019s favorite feature is the zipper bottom, which enables easy dumping into the washing machine.\nSimplify the measuring process for cooking and baking with this adjustable measuring cup that streamlines the measuring process in one simple tool. Branciforte showed the two-cup version, which sells for $11.97 on Amazon, but there are other variations. You can measure dry and liquid ingredients, or even goopy ones, like peanut butter, and it\u2019s easy to clean.\nFor anyone who doesn\u2019t like the designs that come featured on cardboard tissue boxes from the store, Branciforte and Cruze were both excited about tissue box covers, many of which come in neutral colors and easy-to-attach designs. For people with an existing aesthetic, these can keep things looking the way you like them.\nThese range in size and price on Amazon, but some simple square covers run around $6.99 while fancier ones can reach around $17.90.\nAnyone who enjoys the way a cafe delivers your latte with delightful foam can now do this at home with a handheld milk frother.\nAdditionally, this same instrument, which comes in both battery-operated and rechargeable options, can be used as a mixing device for things like soups, sauces and salad dressings, Branciforte said. Options vary from $8.99 to $19.99, depending on the model.\nSatin pillowcases have recently become all the rage for how soft and easy they are on people\u2019s hair at night. However, Branciforte pointed out that they are also pricey, whereas satin hair caps, or bonnets, are quite affordable and offer the same benefits to hair.\nShe finds them especially useful for people with longer hair if you\u2019ve just washed and dried your hair and don\u2019t want it getting frizzy or tangled overnight. It reduces knots and bedhead. While there are a variety of these to choose from, a popular seller is around $9.85.\nFor people who like to create a lot of home ambiance through candles or even a warm crackling fire, Branciforte recommends an item she said she put in everyone\u2019s Christmas stocking \u2014 an electric lighter.\nThis product is rechargeable by USB, has a conveniently bendy neck and will not introduce any nasty lighter fluid into your home for under $13.\nAmazon has jumped on the clothing train, offering essentials of the sort that you might find yourself wearing every day, for casual comfort. In its Amazon Essentials brand, Branciforte raved about the simple two-packs of T-shirts, for men and women, which are typically around $19 (though some can go up closer to $25).\nThough both Cruze and Branciforte are big Amazon fans, they do recommend smart shopping and paying attention to the quality of what you actually receive. Reviews may not be that helpful, unfortunately. A lot of finding what you love is trial and error, but these products give you a great start.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Expensive Costco Items That Are Definitely Worth the Cost\nI'm a Bank Teller: 9 Reasons You Should Never Ask for $2 Bills From the Bank\n5 Reasons You Should Consider an Annuity For Your Retirement Savings\n5 Myths About Debt That Nobody Should Believe in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Rachel Cruze: 10 Best Amazon Products for Less Than $20\n"

        "Text": "A group of creditors have accused Rudy Giuliani of \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d and called on a judge to appoint a trustee to oversee the former New York Mayor\u2019s finances as part of his ongoing bankruptcy case.\n\u201cMore than five months ago, the Debtor commenced his bankruptcy case. One might ask what he has accomplished during that time. An objective review leads to one conclusion: he has accomplished almost nothing,\u201d the filing on Tuesday read.\nThe filing slammed Mr Giuliani for his\u201cegregious spending habits\u201d during the bankruptcy proceedings, highlighting \u201c60 Amazon transactions, charges for entertainment such as Netflix, Prime Video, Kindle, Audible, Paramount+ and Apple services and products and numerous Uber rides.\u201d\nIn December, Mr Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, shortly after he was ordered to pay $148m to Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss for defamatory statements he made about the pair following the 2020 election.\nSince then, the filing alleges, Mr Giuliani has been suspended from his WABC radio show, kept \u201cabysmal\u201c records, paid for employee expenses with his money, and entered into a deal to promote a coffee brand that funnels proceeds to Giuliani-controlled company as a way to avoid to paying creditors.\nThe filing also suggests officials should investigate whether Mr Giuliani committed \u201cbankruptcy crimes\u201d by allegedly using \u201chis businesses to divert resources away from his estate and creditors in connection with his purported income that he allegedly never personally received.\u201d\nThe Independent has contacted Mr Giuliani\u2019s lawyer in the case for comment.\nThe creditors are seeking a 17 June hearing on the matter of appointing a trustee.\nEarlier this month, the judge overseeing the case said he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d at how little progress Mr Giuliani had made in resolving his financial issues.\nThe Trump associate\u2019s lawyer, Heath Berger, said at the time, \u201cThey finally have, I think, gotten things on track.\u201d\nMr Giuliani\u2019s team has insisted he has work lined up and could liquidate his apartment as part of the bankruptcy case.\n"

        "Title": "Missed Out on Amazon? Buy MercadoLibre Stock Instead",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Many investors lament missing out on Amazon. Few predicted it would evolve from an online bookseller into a retail behemoth. Nobody could have predicted that it would pioneer a cloud computing business.\nThe list of those with regrets includes Warren Buffett, who said he was \"too dumb\" to invest before buying shares in 2019. This shows that missed opportunities are also a problem for the most seasoned investors.\nFortunately for investors, Amazon is not the only e-commerce conglomerate, and others have emerged outside of North America. Given its successes, a second-chance e-commerce stock has emerged in Latin America with MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).\nA Stanford student from Argentina named Marcos Galperin founded MercadoLibre in 1999 while still studying for his MBA. Galperin sought to build a platform for everyday shopping in his home region.\nAdmittedly, Latin America is a difficult place for conducting business. However, instead of hampering MercadoLibre, the challenges have made it a stronger business.\nSince Latin America is primarily a cash-based society, Galperin began Mercado Pago to provide financial products to help cash-based customers shop online. Since many of these customers lack a bank account or credit card, these products quickly became popular, so popular that Mercado Pago expanded this service to those not shopping on MercadoLibre.\nLikewise, the lack of reliable shipping options led to the creation of Mercado Envios. This segment helped businesses fulfill and ship orders. It also led to one- and two-day shipping in many areas, a previously unavailable service in Latin America.\nAmid such growth, MercadoLibre launched its IPO in August 2007. Given that a $1,000 investment at that time is worth $61,000 today, investors might assume they have missed the boat on this stock.\nNonetheless, at a market cap of around $90 billion, it is less than 5% of Amazon's current size. While investors have no guarantee that the internet and direct marketing retail stock could achieve a $1.9 trillion market cap like Amazon has, MercadoLibre holds some potential to reach that point and perhaps exceed that point in time.\nMercadoLibre's first market, Argentina, has become an example of how the company can succeed regardless of business conditions. Mercado Pago helped Argentinians cope with the country's massive inflation through investments in its Mercado Fondo investment accounts.\nMoreover, now that inflation in Argentina is falling, MercadoLibre could benefit from increased sales activity, assuming the country's reforms help the country become wealthier.\nAdditionally, a growing middle class in other Latin American markets has bolstered the company's financials. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue of $4.3 billion rose 36% versus the year-ago quarter. This occurred amid a 20% increase in gross merchandise volume and a 35% rise in total payment volume, which showed the continued success of MercadoLibre's two largest businesses.\nFurthermore, the Q1 net income of $344 million surged 71% higher over the last year.\nWhile the company did not offer forward guidance, consensus estimates forecast a 33% increase in revenue and a 77% surge in net income. Thus, its improvements are not a one-time phenomenon, and given MercadoLibre's resilience, its growth is likely to continue for some time to come.\nAdmittedly, at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 78, it is a pricier stock than Amazon, which trades at 52 times earnings. Still, investors should remember that Amazon grew its revenue by only 13% in the most recent quarter. Thus, by paying a 50% higher valuation, MercadoLibre investors receive nearly triple the revenue growth, a factor that could justify such a premium.\nGiven its smaller size and ability to prosper in volatile emerging markets, MercadoLibre looks like a viable second-chance stock to Amazon.\nMercadoLibre has emerged as the leading e-commerce and fintech company in the volatile but fast-growing Latin America region. The company has helped Latin Americans address challenges such as shopping online without credit cards and shipping items faster.\nMoreover, as its customers became wealthier, online shopping has increased, meaning the company has positioned itself to prosper under a variety of conditions. Considering that MercadoLibre has plenty of room to grow, it could serve as a second-chance stock for those wanting to drive returns in the e-commerce business.\nBefore you buy stock in MercadoLibre, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MercadoLibre wasn\u2019t one of them.

Indirect bidders, which are mostly comprised of foreign central banks, took down 64.9% of the sale, with dealers holding onto around 15.36%.\nUpdated at 12:08 PM EDT\nAmazon\u00a0 (AMZN) \u00a0shares hit a fresh record high of $191.29 each Thursday, and were last marked 1.2% higher at $190.28 each, pegging their 2024 advance at around 27% and their market value at just under $2 trillion.\nAmazon posted better-than-expected first quarter earnings on April 30, with revenues rising 13% from last year to $143.3 billion.

wider-than-expected first-quarter loss and softer advertising revenue.\nWBD, which owns the Max streaming service as well as a Hollywood studio unit, saw revenue fall 7% from a year earlier to $9.96 billion, with an overall loss of 40 cents per share.\nShares in the group were marked 1.92% lower in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $7.63 each following the earnings release.\nUpdated at 7:14 AM EDT\nThe Bank of England kept its key lending rate unchanged at 5.25%, the highest since 2008, for a sixth consecutive session following a 7-2 vote of its nine-member rate-setting committee Thursday in London.\nThe widely expected decision also included update growth and inflation forecasts that suggest the consumer-price index will fall to the bank's 2% target in February of next year.\nStock Market Today\nStocks ended little changed on Wednesday, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its run of consecutive session gains to seven, amid easing Treasury yields and solid corporate earnings.\nA solid auction of $42 billion in new 10-year notes Wednesday, which drew bids of nearly $105 billion and upsized interest from foreign buyers, added to the downside moves in yields and provided further support for stocks.\nOvernight markets showed 10-year notes rise to 4.514%, however, with 2-year notes pegged at 4.851%, ahead of weekly jobless

in part to soaring volumes in cryptocurrency trading.\nAirbnb\u00a0 (ABNB) \u00a0shares slumped 8.6% after the online vacation-rental group forecast muted near-term revenue, which offset a stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings report.\nOn Wall Street, futures tied to the S&P 500, which is up 3.02% for the month, suggest an opening-bell decline of around 11 points while those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial are indicating a 56-point pullback.\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq, meanwhile, is called 45 points lower\u00a0in premarket trading\u00a0with Intel\u00a0 (INTC) ,

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 6, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA.\nWith Q1 results from Apple and Amazon now out, we only have Nvidia\u2019s results still awaited at this stage of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of companies. The sub-par growth numbers from Tesla and Apple notwithstanding, the Mag 7 group as a whole showed impressive top- and bottom-line growth numbers.\nIn fact, had it not been for the substantial earnings contribution from the Mag 7, Q1 earnings growth for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.\nIt is interesting to note here that the market reaction to the Tesla and Apple releases has thus far been the best of the group. This may look odd since Tesla\u2019s Q1 earnings were down -53.4% from the year-earlier level on -8.7% lower revenues, and Apple\u2019s earnings and revenue growth rates were -2.2% and -4.3%, respectively. But it isn\u2019t surprising as both companies\u2019 results proved better than what market participants had feared. We also need to keep in mind the impact of Apple\u2019s blockbuster buyback announcement, the largest ever in history.\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its March-quarter results on May 22nd, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +49% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.9% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 21.2% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2024 Q1, the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 22.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +28.2% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues.\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 1200 companies reporting results, including 54 S&P 500 members. This week\u2019s notable reports include Disney, Uber, Lyft, Shopify, and others.\nThrough Friday, May 3rd, we have seen Q1 results from 400 S&P 500 index members, or 80% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 400 index members are up +4.4% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.3% beating EPS estimates and 61% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -2.2%, while the growth pace improves to +8.3% on an ex-energy basis.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.7% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> A Positive Earnings Picture Remains \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Amazon Fresh Just Announced a Major Price Change to Groceries",
        "Author": "  Kiersten Hickman ",
        "Text": "Walking down the aisle at the grocery store can be a discouraging journey these days. Not only are we experiencing shrinkflation \u2014 where our favorite grocery items are slowly getting smaller while the prices remain the same \u2014 but we\u2019re also seeing our favorite discount retailers increasing prices. Nothing like walking around Dollar Tree when prices are no longer $1, but somewhere between $1.25 to $7 on some items. Although these changing products and prices may cast down our spirits, many retailers are trying to help shoppers fill their carts at prices they can actually afford. Recently Amazon Fresh has made the choice to do the same, offering discounted prices that shoppers can feel good about.\nAmazon Fresh announced it will slash the prices of 4,000 weekly grocery items by up to 30%. These prices are available in stores, as well as online. The products that are discounted rotate on a weekly basis, giving shoppers a variety of food items to choose from that will suit their changing interest in recipes to cook at home. Both fresh and pantry items will be discounted, including items such as meat, seafood, frozen foods, dairy, cheese, beverages, snacks, and pasta, according to the original report from CNN.\nAlong with this major change, Amazon Fresh has also announced it is expanding its Prime Savings, giving Amazon Prime members the chance to save 10% on hundreds of grocery items when they shop online.These particular deals are vital for shoppers to keep up with the ever-changing inflation of the grocery market. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, inflation grew for the third consecutive month in April. Despite the fact that some stores have been hit with inflation, other retailers have taken notice and are continuing to find ways to slash prices and help shoppers\u2019 budgets. Target recently announced it is cutting prices on over 5,000 items, and Aldi has slashed the prices on 250 summer essential items on their shelves. Walmart is also discounting grocery items while also providing cheaper prices of high-quality food products through its new Bettergoods store brand.\n"

        "Text": "Student uses ID card to access Flash Bistro\nKENT, Ohio, May 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CBORD, a leading provider of higher education automation solutions, is thrilled to announce the integration of Amazon's Just Walk Out (JWO) technology at Kent State University, one of Ohio's leading public universities.\nJust Walk Out technology revolutionizes the campus shopping experience by detecting what shoppers take from or return to the shelves and creating a seamless virtual shopping session.

        "Author": "  G. Brian Davis ",
        "Text": "Amazon is nothing if not convenient \u2014 is it budget-friendly, though? You click a button or two to buy just about anything available in the entire world and a few days later you have it.\nBut that convenience can make us lazy. Many people now check Amazon first \u2014 and don\u2019t even bother to comparison shop.\nExplore Next: 10 Things Boomers Should Always Buy in Retirement\nBe Aware: 4 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nWhich is exactly the point. Like salivating dogs, Amazon has conditioned us well.\nSo which items should retirees watch out for on Amazon?\nAlternatively, here are 10 things retirees should buy on Amazon.\nIt makes little sense to buy an item for $6.99 when it costs another $6.99 to ship. Unless the combined price is still cheaper than you can find it anywhere else.\nJust make sure you actually check that \u201canywhere else\u201d before clicking the Buy button.\nSee More: 7 Bills You Never Have To Pay When You Retire\nAn entire cottage industry has popped up to provide sellers with glowing reviews. Reviews written by conversational AI chatbots.\nIt\u2019s such a problem on Amazon that the company has started suing fake review brokers.\nBefore just buying into the hype of high review scores and endless \u201cGreat product!\u201d and \u201cAwesome!\u201d reviews, actually read them. Do they mention specific customer experiences with the product? Or could they have been written about any product on the market?\nAlso watch out for robotic sounding reviews that just rattle off product features with no thoughtful commentary. These are a little sneakier, but just as fake.\nPrices on Amazon sometimes look as volatile as a stock chart.\nRetailers often raise a product\u2019s price by 30% then a few weeks later offer a \u201cmassive 25% discount!\u201d Which is still 5% higher than it was last month.\nCheck the pricing history of items on Amazon with CamelCamelCamel before buying. And then check competing retailers.\nAmazon is ruthless about promoting its own flagship products such as Echo and dodging discounts on its competitors\u2019 products such as Google Home.\nIf you want to buy a Big Tech product, go to the source first. You can also check Google Shopping results to quickly compare prices.\nAmazon loves to get you hooked with its \u201cSubscribe & Save\u201d program to earn your business once then collect recurring revenue from you.\nThey set the hook with an initial discount \u2014 and then charge you higher-than-market prices thereafter. And they get away with it because you stop checking the pricing after the first shipment or two.\nPet food makes a perfect example. Owners need it on a recurring basis and love the convenience of it just showing up at the door.\nWhich may be worth paying extra for, especially as a retiree who doesn\u2019t want to haul heavy bags of pet food home from Costco. Just make sure that\u2019s a conscious decision based on a cost-benefit analysis, having checked the prices at Costco, Walmart, Target or other retailers before committing to paying Amazon prices.\nOften food products cost more at Amazon than Costco and even supermarkets.\nWorse, many food products from third-party retailers are either expired or nearing expiration. Double check expiration dates before buying any food product from a third-party seller.\nLikewise, Costco usually beats Amazon on household staples like toilet paper, paper towels and the like.\nCheck bulk-buy purchases at big box stores before clicking that \u201cSubscribe & Save\u201d button on Amazon.\nAmazon is flooded with cheap, generic phone chargers and other electronic accessories.\nAnd you get what you pay for.\nThese products often offer no surge protection, so saving a buck on the charger can fry your $1,500 phone. They also charge slower than the fast charging cables that come from the manufacturer, sometimes turning what could be a one-hour turbo charge to a five-hour wait.\nWhen you buy an expensive, complex electronic device such as a laptop or tablet or phone, you want the best possible warranty and tech support.\nWhich you won\u2019t get from Amazon sellers, in most cases.\nBuy these products directly from the manufacturer for the best warranty and support. Otherwise you can find yourself with the world\u2019s most expensive paperweight ten months from now.\nAnd that says nothing of the risk of counterfeit products.\nCounterfeit products sold on Amazon is such a serious problem that Amazon has created an entire Counterfeit Crimes Unit to combat them.\nNot all products come with the same risk however. There\u2019s virtually no risk of that Kirkland hair spray being counterfeit and a very real risk of that Rolex watch being counterfeit.\nWhen you shop for high-end purses, watches, shoes and clothing brands, watch out for fakes. Many are extremely convincing.\nWhen in doubt, buy directly from the manufacturer.\nNike and Birkenstock don\u2019t sell their shoes on Amazon, to avoid \u201cbrand dilution.\u201d\nWhich means when you see them listed on Amazon, they could be knockoffs or used and being sold as new.\nRepeat the refrain and buy from the manufacturer or another reputable shoe retailer.\nSimilarly, Trader Joe\u2019s doesn\u2019t sell its products online. Costco doesn\u2019t sell its (often excellent) Kirkland generic brand products outside of Costco.\nWhich means when you see those products on Amazon, they\u2019re coming from a reseller looking to earn a profit margin on them. In other words, you can buy them cheaper yourself by going to the source.\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 12 Things You Shouldn\u2019t Buy on Amazon While on a Retirement Budget\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 8, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon's AMZN, Coinbase Global COIN and Transdigm Group TDG.\nAs earnings season begins to wind down, the standout performers are easier to identify. While some stocks posted adequate quarterly earnings, others really wowed Wall Street.\nThese exceptional performers not only exceeded expectations but also provided compelling outlooks, signaling strong potential for future growth.\nAs investors sift through the earnings reports to find winners, I must highlight three stocks that I have been impressed with and believe are poised for further upside potential.\nAmazon's recent earnings report painted a rosy picture, with profits exceeding expectations. The star of the show was their cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which saw significant growth fueled by the surging demand for AI capabilities. This strong performance in AWS underscores Amazon's prime position to capitalize on the booming AI market.\nAWS grew an impressive 17% YoY and brought in $25 billion in revenue for the quarter. Even more impressive was the $9.4 billion profit earned from the segment, demonstrating the huge margins the business enjoys.\nAdditionally, Amazon enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Earnings estimates have been revised considerably higher over the last week and across timeframes. Furthermore, EPS are forecast to grow 29.6% annually, which is a very high pace of growth and among the highest of the mega-cap technology stocks.\nCoinbase Global reported a stunning earnings beat last week, bringing in $4.40 of EPS, far exceeding analysts' expectations of $1.28. Revenue was 20% above estimates as well.\nMore than anything, Coinbase has a dominant role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially in the United States. As long as cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin especially remain in a bull market, Coinbase should be one of the primary beneficiaries.\nCoinbase Global currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflected by strongly upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings expectations have been unanimously upgraded by 250%-300%!\nCoinbase stock is also a powerful trading vehicle. The price action has regularly been consolidating and building out these descending wedges from which it breaks out aggressively from. If COIN stock can clear the $220 level it should make another attempt at its recent highs.\nTransdigm Group soared in its second quarter, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue jumped 20.5%, driven by strong demand across their aerospace platforms. Net income also rose significantly, with earnings per share up over 32% year-over-year. This positive performance reflects the ongoing recovery in the commercial aerospace industry, and TransDigm is well-positioned to benefit from continued growth in passenger traffic.\nTransdigm also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\nTransdigm Group is a lesser-followed stock that has consistently delivered exceptional long-term returns. As a leading manufacturer of aerospace components and systems, TransDigm specializes in producing highly engineered products for use in commercial and military aircraft.\nDespite flying under the radar for many investors, TransDigm's unique business model and focus on high-quality, proprietary products have contributed to its impressive track record of growth and profitability. Over the years, TransDigm has demonstrated its ability to generate strong cash flow and consistently outperform market expectations, making it a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to the aerospace industry.\nWhile there were a number of strong earnings reported this quarter, these three stocks really jumped out to me. Not only are all of them regular market outperformers but are further bolstered by the top Zacks Ranks.\nFor investors looking to add exposure following earnings, these are three worthy considerations.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 13, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD and Amazon AMZN.\nWalmart shares held their own in last month\u2019s market weakness, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning, particularly relative to Target and Home Depot.\nFrom the market\u2019s March 28th peak through the end of April 2024, the S&P 500 index lost -3.8% of its value, while Walmart was down only -1.4%. Target lost -9.2% of its value during that same period, while Home Depot shares were down -12.9%.\nWalmart\u2019s defensive attributes reflect the retailer\u2019s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart\u2019s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\nWalmart\u2019s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under increasing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart\u2019s same-store sales in its quarterly release on Thursday, May 16th; Target reports the following week on May 22nd.\nWalmart is expected to report $0.52 in EPS on $159.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.1% and +4.5%, respectively. Trends in Walmart\u2019s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, so any favorable turn in the demand trends for this relatively discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target and Home Depot. Home Depot reports on Tuesday, May 14th.\nTarget shares were up big following each of the preceding two reports, which assured investors about management\u2019s ability on the margins and the \u2018shrinkage issue\u2019 they appeared to be struggling with over the last couple of years. Home Depot is a housing play and, as such, remains exposed to the seemingly higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop.\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 21 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 21 retailers that have reported are up +54.5% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 57.1% beating revenue estimates.\nThe online players and restaurant operators have struggled to exceed EPS and revenue estimates in Q1. In fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.\nWith respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 21 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q1 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 460 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 10th. We have almost 400 companies reporting results this week, including 7 S&P 500 members. In addition to Walmart and Home Depot, this week\u2019s line-up includes Cisco Systems, Deere & Company, China\u2019s Alibaba, JD.com, and many others.\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 460 index members are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context.\nEarnings growth for these companies would have been +7.9% instead of +4.8% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag.\nAs we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been on the weaker side for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -1%, while the growth pace improves to +8.9% on an ex-energy basis.\nFor the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9.2% on +4.5% higher revenues.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% on +1.5% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Growth Poised to Accelerate \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The conglomerate owns substantial positions in private and public success stories like GEICO, Coca-Cola, and even Apple.\nHere's why Berkshire could become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club within the next 12 months.\nBuffett is a quintessential value investor. He likes to buy good businesses at a cheap price, and sometimes great businesses at a fair price, with the intention of holding on to them for decades. He looks for companies with steady growth, consistent profitability, and strong management teams. He especially likes businesses that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\nHere's an example that perfectly displays the effects of compounding that helped Buffett build his empire. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of American Express (NYSE: AXP) between 1991 and 1995. That holding has grown in value to a staggering $36.8 billion today. Even better, Amex stock makes Berkshire money just for owning it, paying Berkshire $364 million in dividends in 2023 alone. That dividend means Berkshire recoups its entire initial investment in Amex every four years just from the dividends. That's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories.\nBerkshire was originally a textiles business, and it was on the verge of failure when Buffett stepped in to buy it in 1965. When he realized he couldn't turn it around, he transformed it into a holding company for various investments.\nSince then, Berkshire has purchased many companies outright, including GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen. But it also owns a portfolio of 47 publicly traded stocks and securities worth $377.9 billion. This portfolio includes its shares of Amex, Coca-Cola, and Apple.\nApple is Berkshire's single largest holding, with a value of $149.9 billion accounting for 39.7% of its stock portfolio. It would be even larger, but the conglomerate recently sold 13% of its position (reportedly for tax reasons). Considering Berkshire only spent around $38 billion accumulating Apple shares since 2016, this investment has seriously paid off.\nI want to take a moment to highlight the Coca-Cola stake, too. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion buying shares of the beverage giant between 1988 and 1994, and it has never sold any of them. Today, that position is worth $25.2 billion, and it paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023 alone.\nYou might notice the Coca-Cola story sounds very similar to the Amex story, and its is. What it points out is that Buffett didn't catch lightning in a bottle, nor is his strategy exceptional. In fact, Berkshire's long-term positions in Bank of America, Visa, and Moody's followed a similar trajectory, thanks to Buffett's simple formula centered around patient investing.\nIf investors are willing to maintain a long-term view, they can also reap the benefits of compounding in the same way.\nBerkshire Class A shares soared in value by 4,384,748% between 1965 and 2023. That translates into a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is nearly twice the 10.2% average annual return in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\nThe outperformance is mind-boggling in dollar terms. An investment of $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth $43.8 million at the end of 2023! The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $312,230.\nBerkshire has the financial results to support its incredible returns. The business generated $49.3 million in revenue during 1965, a figure which grew to $364.4 billion last year. Berkshire's diverse portfolio of businesses contributed to the latter number: $83.4 billion came from insurance premiums; $101.4 billion came from its railroad, utilities, and energy businesses; and $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various entities under Berkshire's umbrella.\nBerkshire also grew its net earnings from just $2.3 million in 1965 to a whopping $96.2 billion in 2023.\nConsidering Berkshire has a market capitalization of nearly $900 billion as of this writing, its stock only needs to gain 11% from here to catapult the company into the $1 trillion club. Its 58-year-long track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns (on average) suggests it's a shoo-in to get there within the next 12 months.\nA few things will work in Berkshire's favor going forward. For starters, Apple just announced a $100 billion stock buyback, which is the largest in the history of corporate America. That will organically increase the conglomerate's equity stake in the iPhone maker. Plus, top holdings like Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola continue to raise their dividends, so Berkshire will likely earn a record payout this year.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is also likely to cut interest rates in the second half of 2024. That could spark an increase in economic activity which should boost many of the businesses in Berkshire's portfolio, especially those serving consumers and those in the transport and logistics industries.\nFinally, Buffett continues to be a big believer in the company's future. He authorized the repurchase of $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023 and a further $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Buffett has now overseen $71.4 billion worth of share repurchases since 2020 alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock.\nAbsent any external economic shocks, Berkshire appears almost certain to be the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club in the coming year.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ethan Howland ",
        "Text": "This story was originally published on Utility Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Utility Dive newsletter.\nDuke Energy is developing a framework for offering clean energy to large commercial and industrial customers in the Carolinas, with an initial focus on Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nucor, the companies said Wednesday.\nThe planned Accelerating Clean Energy tariffs will include financing options that could be used to support emerging technologies such as long-duration energy storage and advanced nuclear power as well as \u201cmega\u201d projects, Lon Huber, senior vice president for pricing and customer solutions, said Thursday in an interview.\nDuke expects to begin filing new tariffs with utility regulators in North Carolina and South Carolina within a month or two, but the process will occur in stages, Huber said. The clean energy tariffs will be available to Duke\u2019s C&I customers.\nThe C&I class makes up about 35% of Duke\u2019s overall load in the Carolinas, but it is expected to grow in the next five years as technology companies and manufacturers expand their operations, according to Huber.\nThe Accelerating Clean Energy program will offer C&I companies a suite of clean energy options to pick from to meet their clean energy goals without increasing costs for other customers, he said. A company would have an individual \u201clean transition tariff\u201d\u00a0that could cover, for example, demand response, onsite generation and 24/7 clean energy, according to Huber.\nThe planned program is multifaceted \u201cbecause it has to be comprehensive \u2026 because there's no silver bullet on clean energy yet, so you need to have a bunch of different technologies that work in harmony to get to deep decarbonisation,\u201d Huber said. \u201cIt takes \u2018all of the above\u2019 to do this both at a system level but also individualized for a customer.\u201d\nThe plan includes the potential for various financing options that could enable emerging technology, such as a premium for a resource\u2019s attributes, help with cost overrun protection and low-cost financing, according to Huber.\u00a0\n\u201cIt creates and formalizes a new pillar of support for emerging clean tech and large mega projects, and this is something that really hasn't been standardized or done on any scale before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe'll be working it out with these partners, with regulators and other stakeholders on what's the best way to structure a tariff to help capture the variety of different ways a large customer can support these types of emerging or big clean energy projects.\u201d\nThe companies signing initial memorandums of understanding with Duke have a range of clean energy goals.\nGoogle, for example, aims to run its operations on clean electricity every hour of the day by 2030. \u201cThrough collaboration with Duke Energy, the Clean Transition Tariff creates a pathway for us and our peers to bring new, innovative solutions to the forefront faster,\u201d Briana Kobor, Google\u2019s head of energy market innovation, said in a statement.\nIt\u2019s good that large customers are pushing for increased clean energy options beyond \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d utility supply, but there may be smaller C&I customers and residential customers that would also want clean power beyond what Duke already offers, according to Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.\nAlso, the plans by the large customers like Google to acquire clean energy for their facilities may call into question Duke\u2019s recent proposal to add about 2 GW of gas-fired generation to meet rising loads, Jimenez said Thursday.\n\u201cIf there's a tariff coming that allows all of these large corporate entities that have significant climate goals to procure new clean generation for themselves, then we shouldn't be building gas plants to also meet that load,\u201d he said.\n"

        "Title": "Walmart, Target, Amazon and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 20, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Walmart\u2019s WMT, Target TGT, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.\nWalmart\u2019s beat-and-raise quarterly release should ordinarily provide favorable read-throughs for Target, which is scheduled to report results before the market\u2019s open on Wednesday, May 22nd. But the two companies have different business models, and that makes expectations off target.\nTo start, Walmart has effectively added a technological component to its well-established reputation for value. Walmart\u2019s digital prowess has allowed it to offer a variety of convenient shopping options, allowing it to gain market share, with mostly high-income households finding the company\u2019s service offerings hard to resist. The company\u2019s revenues in the quarter increased +5.8% (in constant currency), with digital sales up +21% from the same period last year.\nAnother major point of distinction between the two retailers is their merchandise mix, with Walmart heavily weighted towards groceries and Target towards discretionary merchandise. Walmart enjoyed mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in the latest quarter, with the aforementioned high-income households attracted to the retailer for its convenient delivery and pick-up options.\nWalmart\u2019s general merchandise, which can roughly be considered comparable to the bulk of Target\u2019s merchandise mix, continued to show soft results, with same-store sales down in the low single digits in the quarter. Most analysts expect Target to show low single-digit same-store sales declines but also expect some sequential improvement in the trend line\nTarget is expected to bring in $2.05 in EPS on $24.5 billion in revenues, with earnings unchanged from the year-ago period on -3.2% lower revenues. The stock was up big following each of the last two quarterly releases in March and November, as can be seen in the one-year performance chart below relative to Walmart and the Zacks Retail sector.\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +38.7% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 69.6% beating EPS estimates and 56.5% beating revenue estimates.\nWalmart beat both EPS and revenue estimates, but Home Depot missed on revenues. Aside from these two \u2018conventional\u2019 retailers, the scorecard at this stage primarily reflects the Q1 performance of the digital players and restaurant operators. As the above beats data shows, these companies have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q1.\nIn fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.\nWith respect to earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q1 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 467 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 17th. We have almost 150 companies reporting results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members. This week, the most keenly awaited earnings release isn\u2019t from Target but rather from Nvidia, which reports after the market\u2019s close on Wednesday, May 22nd. Lowe\u2019s, TJX Cos, Macy\u2019s, and Ralph Lauren are some of the other companies reporting this week.\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 467 index members are up +4.6% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues, with 77.7% beating EPS estimates and 60.2% beating revenue estimates.\nWe have been flagging an acceleration in the earnings growth trend, which becomes more clear once the Bristol Myers drag is removed from the data; the pharma giant came out with a huge one-time charge.\nEarnings growth for these companies would have been +7.5% instead of +4.6% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag.\nAs we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been weaker for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.9% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy and sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -0.7% while the growth pace improves to +9.2% on an ex-Energy basis.\nFor the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9% on +4.5% higher revenues.\nThe revisions trend has been very favorable for Q2 estimates. Looking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.6% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Current Earnings Outlook Reflects Positivity \nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Is Amazon a Good Stock to Buy Right Now?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The list of businesses that have rewarded investors more than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has in the past two decades is certainly very small. The tech juggernaut's shares have skyrocketed 4,760% since May 2004, making some people very rich along the way.\nWith the company now worth a whopping $1.9 trillion and having generated $575 billion in 2023 net sales, investors are probably wondering what the future holds. \nIs Amazon a good stock to buy right now? Here are some factors to consider.\nIf a business achieves the massive scale that Amazon has, it's reasonable to assume that there won't be much growth going forward. But here's where the company can prove you wrong. In fact, Amazon still has multiple growth engines it can lean on in the years ahead.\nHere in the U.S., online shopping currently makes up less than 16% of all retail spending. As e-commerce continues to steal share from brick-and-mortar retail, Amazon is poised to capture a large chunk of that trend. According to Statista, almost 40% of all the money spent online in this country goes through Amazon.\nWith Amazon Web Services (AWS), cloud computing is an area that the business is very focused on. This segment posted revenue growth of 17% in Q1, now at an annualized run rate of $100 billion. Given AWS' tremendous trailing-12-month operating margin of 31%, it's going to continue boosting the overall company's bottom line in the years ahead.\nThanks to its broad suite of AI-related products and services that can help businesses better serve their employees and customers, AWS is already finding demand from major clients, like Accenture, Siemens, and Volkswagen. As more companies keep transitioning to a cloud-based environment, AWS will look to be an even more important infrastructure partner.\nWith $11.8 billion in revenue in the last three months, digital advertising is undoubtedly becoming a more important aspect of the Amazon machine. With the popular online marketplace attracting so much attention, as well as the Prime Video streaming service, the company has valuable properties that it can monetize. \nAll of these powerful secular trends simply mean that Amazon is set to increase its sales. Wall Street consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to rise at a compound annual rate of 11.2% between 2023 and 2026.\nEven though the stock has been a fantastic winner historically, it's not expensive right now, trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 3.3. That's about in line with its trailing-10-year average.\nBesides the growth trends I discussed, investors would be acquiring a business that has a wide economic moat. In fact, Amazon is one of the most competitively advantaged enterprises on the face of the planet.\nFor starters, the company has unrivaled scale, particularly as it relates to the e-commerce segment. Amazon has spent so much time and money on building its sprawling logistics footprint that it can ship products at much lower cost than others. This will help the business maintain its lead when it comes to online shopping.\nIn the internet age, data is the new oil. The only difference is that data is infinite. Companies that can not only collect massive amounts of data, but also leverage it to better serve their user base, will continue to be the big winners.\nHere's where AWS truly shines. \"AWS not only has the broadest array of storage, database, analytics, and data management services for customers, it also has more customers and data store than anybody else,\" CEO Andy Jassy said on the Q2 2023 earnings call. This means the company has the insights that can inform its product development, solidifying its position as a mission-critical partner for clients.\nAmazon may be one of the world's most valuable companies. But it's still worthy of a spot in your portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $635,982!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Luke Martin ",
        "Text": "The US' Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit against Amazon regarding its Prime membership programme continues, Reuters has reported.\nA Seattle judge recently rejected Amazon's attempt to dismiss the case.\nThe FTC accuses Amazon of deceptive practices in enrolling customers into Prime memberships and then making it difficult to cancel.\nThe FTC first filed the lawsuit in June 2023, alleging that Amazon had misled consumers and made it cumbersome to cancel Prime subscriptions.\nAccording to the FTC, some customers signed up for Prime unintentionally and were charged for multiple months before cancelling.\nReuters noted Amazon argued against the FTC's claims, stating that it clearly disclosed key points such as pricing and automatic renewal to Prime users.\nIt further accused the FTC of using undefined terms such as incorporating a 'manipulative' website design to unfairly target it.\nThe FTC, however, countered that Amazon employed deceptive user interface designs, known as 'dark patterns,' to trick users into signing up for automatically renewing subscriptions.\nThe FTC seeks both civil penalties and a permanent injunction to prevent such practices in the future.\nAccording to Reuters, this lawsuit is part of the Biden administration's broader effort to regulate big tech companies.\nThe FTC also has a separate antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of restricting merchants from offering lower prices. That case is set for trial in October 2026.\nInterestingly, the FTC claims that Amazon revamped its cancellation process in April 2023, likely due to pressure from the agency.\nHowever, the FTC argues that cancelling Prime still requires an excessive number of clicks (five on desktop and six on mobile).\nThe upcoming non-jury trial for the Prime membership lawsuit is scheduled for February 2025.\nThis case has significant implications for e-commerce businesses and their subscription practices, with potential consequences for how companies acquire and retain customers.\n\"Amazon faces FTC lawsuit over allegedly deceptive Prime practices\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Atlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Atlas Air will stop flying freighter aircraft in Amazon\u2019s domestic parcel network by the middle of next year and concentrate on international widebody service for its growing customer base, which will soon include Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu, CEO Michael Steen said in an interview.\nBoth parties have agreed to terminate contracts under which Atlas provides crews, routine maintenance and insurance (CMI) for 25 converted freighters: eight Boeing 737-800s and 17 Boeing 767-300s. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is responsible for providing the aircraft. The contracts were to expire in March 2026.\nAt the same time, privately held Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and the e-commerce giant have agreed to extend for three years the leases on 16 B767s operated by Atlas Air, Steen said. The aircraft are owned by Atlas\u2019 leasing subsidiary, Titan Aviation, and were originally leased to Amazon for 10 years. The e-tailer, which separately hired Atlas to fly the aircraft, will be free to transfer the aircraft to another operator that signs a CMI contract.\nTitan leases 19 total 767 aircraft to Amazon, including two that are operated by rival Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG). The three aircraft that weren\u2019t extended have extension options.\nAmazon directly controls the eight 737-800s, which are leased from AerCap and could also be placed with another cargo airline.\nSteen said Atlas Air will reallocate resources to intercontinental operations, where the potential for profits is greater. Toward that end, the airline is adding eight widebody freighters in 2024.\nTwo 777 production freighters ordered from Boeing last year are scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter for an undisclosed customer. Ocean shipping giant CMA CGM recently announced that its startup airline has struck a CMI agreement with Atlas Air to operate two Boeing 777 freighters on trans-Pacific routes, starting in the coming months. And Atlas Air recently acquired four previously owned Boeing 747-400 cargo jets that will join the fleet in the third quarter, two of which will be dedicated to Shein and Temu.\n\u201cSo strategically, as we think about the return on investment on the assets that we\u2019re deploying, we are definitely going for the larger widebody aircraft and the intercontinental market where growth is the strongest,\u201d Steen told FreightWaves.\nAtlas Air currently operates or leases 112 aircraft, including 48 B747-400s, 10 B747-8s, seven B777-200s, with the fleet reaching 120 aircraft by year\u2019s end. Sister airline Polar Air Cargo operates nine widebody jets.\nWhile the market is oversaturated with narrowbody regional freighters, the future is bright for operators of long-haul cargo jets, the CEO declared. Atlas Air currently occupies more than 10% of the global widebody freighter fleet and is well positioned to take advantage of growing demand for industrial goods and electronics, as well as a surge in e-commerce shipments.\nSteen pointed to forecasts for compound annual growth rates of 3.5% to 4.5% versus 1% growth in capacity across the industry and a large retirement wave for aging freighters as reasons for investing in large freighters such as the 747 and 777. He has previously said that about 20% of the global fleet of 650 widebody freighters are older than 30 years and nearing retirement.\nStructural changes in the passenger sector are also driving the need for more dedicated freighters. About 60% of global air cargo volume moves on all-cargo aircraft and 40% rides in passenger bellies, but according to a study by McKinsey, only 47% of intercontinental belly hold capacity is usable for airfreight because airlines post-COVID have changed cabin interiors to accommodate more premium-class seating, driving passengers to carry more luggage and reducing space for containers. Meanwhile, airlines are also reorienting networks to serve more leisure destinations where cargo demand is limited.\nThe boom in shipments from e-commerce platforms and fast-fashion companies in China has become a driving force behind the air cargo market\u2019s recovery and shows no sign of slowing down. E-commerce represented about 19% of global retail sales in 2023 and is on track to capture 41% of the market by 2027, according to Boston Consulting Group.\nShein will be the second fast-fashion retailer to sign a long-term dedicated charter agreement with Atlas Air, following Spain-based Inditex. The new breed of fashion houses constantly introduce huge amounts of new products on their websites with very short inventory turnover time, making it important to quickly deliver orders to customers and stores before trends change. Atlas Air already operates dedicated freighters around the world for Alibaba\u2019s logistics arm, while several freight forwarders and Mediterranean Shipping Co.\u2019s new cargo airline use time-chartered aircraft to support their e-commerce customers.\n\u201cTheir volumes are so large that they need dedicated freighters,\u201d said Steen. \u201cWe are their flying warehouse, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\nShein and Temu already use Atlas Air for short-term charters, but they will have full control of aircraft starting in the third quarter.\nAtlas Air is the largest operator of 747 freighters in the world and added to its lead with the four used 747-400s. Two of the cargo jets were acquired from Silkway West Airlines in Azerbaijan. Two former China Airlines aircraft were picked up from U.S. trader Jetran, as previously reported by trade publication Cargo Facts.\nNippon Cargo Airlines last week renewed an agreement with Atlas to operate five of NCA\u2019s 747-400 freighters between Asia and North America amid growing demand. And YunExpress, a freight forwarder in China, in March signed a long-term charter agreement with Atlas for use of a second Boeing 777-200 freighter.\nThe phaseout of flying for Amazon will also free up five 767s previously maintained as spares to operate full time for Atlas customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, Steen said. The company plans to soon place some of the medium-widebody freighters with new customers that have signed long-term package leases, which include an aircraft, along with the crew, maintenance and insurance.\nSteen dismissed suggestions the airline will shrink its pilot cohort because of the lost Amazon business, noting that it needs about 250 pilots and staff to support the eight large freighters and the incremental increase in 767 flying. He told employees during a company town hall earlier this week that there are no plans to furlough pilots who choose to stay, according to accounts of the meeting posted in pilot chat rooms.\n\u201cWhen we look at reports that a lot of pilots are going to be without a seat, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d the Atlas chief said.\nThe change in Atlas\u2019 partnership with Amazon makes it clear that at least a portion of the 767 fleet will be placed with ABX Air, one of two cargo airlines owned by Air Transport Services Group. In early May, ATSG announced that Amazon will provide 10 additional 767-300 freighters to operate on its behalf under a five-year contract and that ABX will begin flying them in June. ATSG did not say from where Amazon would obtain the aircraft, all of which are expected to be delivered by Dec. 1.\nAmazon has the right to place up to 10 more aircraft with ABX, which currently operates four B767-200s for Amazon. Sister airline Air Transport International operates more than 40 767s on Amazon\u2019s behalf.\nAmazon owns nearly 20% of ATSG. It previously owned a stake in Atlas Air, but the shares were bought out by the new ownership group. Amazon also dry leases two 767-300s from Titan Aviation that are operated by ATSG carriers.\nAmazon\u2019s other providers of outsourced air cargo service in the United States are Sun Country Airlines, which operates 737-800s, and Hawaiian Airlines, with two Airbus A330-300 converted freighters.\nSteen declined to provide specifics about the breakup with Amazon over the dedicated transportation agreements, which give Amazon the option to terminate with 180 days of written notice for circumstances such as a change of ownership or performance issues. Penalty clauses can apply to either party for early termination but are likely subject to negotiation. Atlas Air was taken private in early 2023 by a consortium of investors led by Apollo Global Management.\nAmazon media representatives didn\u2019t respond to inquiries about changes to the company\u2019s air network. One analyst familiar with airlines that provide outsourced airlift for express delivery companies, who requested anonymity so as not to jeopardize business relationships, expressed skepticism that Atlas would voluntarily give up domestic flying to concentrate on widebody operations while acknowledging new ownership could value the return on investment differently.\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\u00a0\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\nYunExpress charters Atlas Air freighters for US e-commerce service\nThe post Atlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported solid financial results for the first quarter on April 30. Revenue grew 13% over the year-ago quarter, and solid cost controls provided a massive boost to the company's profits.\nAfter the report came out, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintained an overweight (buy) rating on the shares but increased the price target from $215 to $220, representing upside of 23% above the current share price.\nHere's what's going right for Amazon, and why the stock could hit a new high in the next few years, if not sooner.\nManagement is generating enormous upside for Amazon's profitability by more efficiently allocating inventory across its network of fulfillment centers and squeezing more efficiency out of capital spending. These efforts led to a net profit of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, a big jump from $3.2 billion a year ago.\nFollowing the massive improvement on the bottom line, Morgan Stanley raised its forward estimates for operating income and earnings per share by about 10%. While the firm estimates that Amazon's North American retail business is still not profitable when excluding advertising revenue, which grew 24% year over year, it sees further upside for Amazon's profits from further cost efficiencies and accelerating growth in the high-margin Amazon Web Services cloud business.\nIt's not unreasonable to expect the share price to hit a new high. At $220, the shares would trade at 27 times trailing cash from operations per share, which would still be in the middle of the previous 10-year range for this valuation metric.\nConsidering the value underneath the shares, Amazon still looks like a great buy even after the run over the last year.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is mainly known for its online retail marketplace, which has been a go-to website for individuals to find great deals on things ranging from large appliances to clothing, electronics and toys. If a product exists, you can be sure it can be found on Amazon.\nThe stock has doubled in price since its lows at the start of 2023. Shares have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and online retailer segment during this time.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAMZN Data by GuruFocus\nWhen people think of Amazon, they think of their e-commerce site, Amazon Prime and Prime Video. These segments account for almost 85% of the e-commerce giant's revenue and are a very important part of its business. This is what I am including in Amazon's traditional operating segments (essentially, everything but Amazon Web Services):\nOnline stores - revenue generated from selling items on Amazon.com.\nThird-party seller services - from fees from other businesses that sell on Amazon, which includes sales commissions, fees for inventory storage and shipping fees.\nAdvertising services - revenue generated from sponsored ads on Amazon.com and commercials on Prime Video.\nSubscription services - revenue from customer subscriptions to Amazon Prime.\nPhysical stores - revenue from physical store locations.\nOther - includes everything else from Amazon's health care services to fees from its credit card.\nThe growth in these segments is high, but has been slowing recently. The main reason is increased competition. Amazon was the major early-adopter in e-commerce and subscription-based shipping as well as a lesser early-adopter in online video streaming. However, competitors have caught up and have been slowly chipping away at Amazon's market share.\nAmazon has made some changes to better position itself in a crowded market. The biggest change is including commercials in its Prime Video offerings, which started this past January. This worried investors, but it has paid off. In the first quarter, subscription revenue rose over 20% compared to the prior year, showing consumers were fine with the change and kept their Amazon Prime subscriptions.\nAdvertising revenue also saw a benefit from that change, growing over 24% in the first quarter compared to the prior year.\nThe company also recently announced these commercials will soon allow Prime Video watchers to purchase advertised products during the break. I think this is a great and innovative idea from Amazon. Competing video streaming platforms are unable to replicate this functionality since none of them have their own e-commerce store. It is also important to note that Amazon has a lot of data about its subscribers and can target their commercials more effectively than competitors.\nAmazon Web Services, or AWS, is Amazon's cloud service. It generates revenue through cloud computing, storage and database services for various organizations.\nThe company has separated out its AWS revenue since 2013 and it has grown like a rocket, gaining almost 30 times in the last decade and accounting for 16% of sales.\nAWS is the leading provider within the cloud computing industry, accounting for almost a third of the market share.\nThe cloud services industry is expected to grow significantly over the next decade. Revenue is expected to be 20% higher in 2024 and triple current values by 2032.\nEven with rapid industry growth and increased competition, Amazon has been able to maintain market leadership and its 30% to 35% market share. There is no reason to believe that is going to change.\nDuring the first-quarter 2024 conference call, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavksy mentioned the importance of AWS and the investment Amazon is making to ensure its success:\n\"As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals, making bigger commitments. Still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI.\"\nAnalysts are forecasting 2024 annual revenue for Amazon just below $640 billion.\nThe company's enterprise value-sales ratio hovers around 3 historically. Morningstar analysts value Amazon using 3 times EV/sales, which I agree with. This leads to a fair value of $179.61 per share, which is currently just under 4% overvalued based on median revenue analyst estimates.\nI think Amazon is going to outperform analyst expectations and I am forecasting revenue to be above $643 billion. At 3 times EV/sales, this results in a price target of $181. Here is why I think Amazon is going to exceed analyst expectations:\nTraditional segment revenue is going to be higher than analysts expect. Advertising, online stores and third-party seller services are going to drive this outperformance through targeted commercials steering consumers to purchase more products from Amazon.\nAWS revenue is going to maintain its position as the market leader in the cloud industry and continue its 30% to 35% market share. This will be accomplished because Amazon is heavily investing in this growing space.\nAmazon revenue forecasted by analysts has surprisingly fallen over the last 90 days. This is despite the company beating expectations in the first quarter.\nAmazon is currently trading at $186.57, which is slightly higher than my valuation of $181. Even though I think that is slightly overvalued, I like the stock as an investment.\nThe GF Score agrees at 90 out of 100:\nThe most straightforward way to buy into Amazon is to simply purchase shares. However, investors have different ways to get exposure to Amazon and one alternative I really like is selling put options to purchase the stock.\nAmazon is currently slightly overvalued and put options can allow investors to collect some premium while potentially purchasing the stock at a specified price. As an example, we can look at options expiring at the end of May.\nI like the stock around $181 and analysts like it just under $180, so let's focus on put options with a strike price at $180.\nPut options at $180 for May 31 expiration are selling at around $1.25. Options are in contracts of 100, so if an investor sold this put option, they would receive $125 to purchase 100 shares of Amazon on that day at $180. If shares of Amazon are trading above $180, the option would expire worthless and the investor would keep the $125 premium. If the price is below $180 on that date, the investor would purchase 100 shares of Amazon at $180 (which requires $18,000 in available capital).\nIf an investor does not have the available cash to buy 100 shares of Amazon, or if they do not want that much exposure, then purchasing the shares outright is definitely the better choice. However, getting paid ($125) to buy a stock we like at a price we want ($180) is a great way to add income to your portfolio.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Atlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Atlas Air will stop flying freighter aircraft in Amazon\u2019s domestic parcel network by the middle of next year and concentrate on international widebody service for its growing customer base, which will soon include Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu, CEO Michael Steen said in an interview.\nBoth parties have agreed to terminate contracts under which Atlas provides crews, routine maintenance and insurance (CMI) for 25 converted freighters: eight Boeing 737-800s and 17 Boeing 767-300s. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is responsible for providing the aircraft. The contracts were to expire in March 2026.\nAt the same time, privately held Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and the e-commerce giant have agreed to extend for three years the leases on 16 B767s operated by Atlas Air, Steen said. The aircraft are owned by Atlas\u2019 leasing subsidiary, Titan Aviation, and were originally leased to Amazon for 10 years. The e-tailer, which separately hired Atlas to fly the aircraft, will be free to transfer the aircraft to another operator that signs a CMI contract.\nTitan leases 19 total 767 aircraft to Amazon, including two that are operated by rival Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG). The three aircraft that weren\u2019t extended have extension options.\nAmazon directly controls the eight 737-800s, which are leased from AerCap and could also be placed with another cargo airline.\nSteen said Atlas Air will reallocate resources to intercontinental operations, where the potential for profits is greater. Toward that end, the airline is adding eight widebody freighters in 2024.\nTwo 777 production freighters ordered from Boeing last year are scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter for an undisclosed customer. Ocean shipping giant CMA CGM recently announced that its startup airline has struck a CMI agreement with Atlas Air to operate two Boeing 777 freighters on trans-Pacific routes, starting in the coming months. And Atlas Air recently acquired four previously owned Boeing 747-400 cargo jets that will join the fleet in the third quarter, two of which will be dedicated to Shein and Temu.\n\u201cSo strategically, as we think about the return on investment on the assets that we\u2019re deploying, we are definitely going for the larger widebody aircraft and the intercontinental market where growth is the strongest,\u201d Steen told FreightWaves.\nAtlas Air currently operates or leases 112 aircraft, including 48 B747-400s, 10 B747-8s, seven B777-200s, with the fleet reaching 120 aircraft by year\u2019s end. Sister airline Polar Air Cargo operates nine widebody jets.\nWhile the market is oversaturated with narrowbody regional freighters, the future is bright for operators of long-haul cargo jets, the CEO declared. Atlas Air currently occupies more than 10% of the global widebody freighter fleet and is well positioned to take advantage of growing demand for industrial goods and electronics, as well as a surge in e-commerce shipments.\nSteen pointed to forecasts for compound annual growth rates of 3.5% to 4.5% versus 1% growth in capacity across the industry and a large retirement wave for aging freighters as reasons for investing in large freighters such as the 747 and 777. He has previously said that about 20% of the global fleet of 650 widebody freighters are older than 30 years and nearing retirement.\nStructural changes in the passenger sector are also driving the need for more dedicated freighters. About 60% of global air cargo volume moves on all-cargo aircraft and 40% rides in passenger bellies, but according to a study by McKinsey, only 47% of intercontinental belly hold capacity is usable for airfreight because airlines post-COVID have changed cabin interiors to accommodate more premium-class seating, driving passengers to carry more luggage and reducing space for containers. Meanwhile, airlines are also reorienting networks to serve more leisure destinations where cargo demand is limited.\nThe boom in shipments from e-commerce platforms and fast-fashion companies in China has become a driving force behind the air cargo market\u2019s recovery and shows no sign of slowing down. E-commerce represented about 19% of global retail sales in 2023 and is on track to capture 41% of the market by 2027, according to Boston Consulting Group.\nShein will be the second fast-fashion retailer to sign a long-term dedicated charter agreement with Atlas Air, following Spain-based Inditex. The new breed of fashion houses constantly introduce huge amounts of new products on their websites with very short inventory turnover time, making it important to quickly deliver orders to customers and stores before trends change. Atlas Air already operates dedicated freighters around the world for Alibaba\u2019s logistics arm, while several freight forwarders and Mediterranean Shipping Co.\u2019s new cargo airline use time-chartered aircraft to support their e-commerce customers.\n\u201cTheir volumes are so large that they need dedicated freighters,\u201d said Steen. \u201cWe are their flying warehouse, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\nShein and Temu already use Atlas Air for short-term charters, but they will have full control of aircraft starting in the third quarter.\nAtlas Air is the largest operator of 747 freighters in the world and added to its lead with the four used 747-400s. Two of the cargo jets were acquired from Silkway West Airlines in Azerbaijan. Two former China Airlines aircraft were picked up from U.S. trader Jetran, as previously reported by trade publication Cargo Facts.\nNippon Cargo Airlines last week renewed an agreement with Atlas to operate five of NCA\u2019s 747-400 freighters between Asia and North America amid growing demand. And YunExpress, a freight forwarder in China, in March signed a long-term charter agreement with Atlas for use of a second Boeing 777-200 freighter.\nThe phaseout of flying for Amazon will also free up five 767s previously maintained as spares to operate full time for Atlas customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, Steen said. The company plans to soon place some of the medium-widebody freighters with new customers that have signed long-term package leases, which include an aircraft, along with the crew, maintenance and insurance.\nSteen dismissed suggestions the airline will shrink its pilot cohort because of the lost Amazon business, noting that it needs about 250 pilots and staff to support the eight large freighters and the incremental increase in 767 flying. He told employees during a company town hall earlier this week that there are no plans to furlough pilots who choose to stay, according to accounts of the meeting posted in pilot chat rooms.\n\u201cWhen we look at reports that a lot of pilots are going to be without a seat, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d the Atlas chief said.\nThe change in Atlas\u2019 partnership with Amazon makes it clear that at least a portion of the 767 fleet will be placed with ABX Air, one of two cargo airlines owned by Air Transport Services Group. In early May, ATSG announced that Amazon will provide 10 additional 767-300 freighters to operate on its behalf under a five-year contract and that ABX will begin flying them in June. ATSG did not say from where Amazon would obtain the aircraft, all of which are expected to be delivered by Dec. 1.\nAmazon has the right to place up to 10 more aircraft with ABX, which currently operates four B767-200s for Amazon. Sister airline Air Transport International operates more than 40 767s on Amazon\u2019s behalf.\nAmazon owns nearly 20% of ATSG. It previously owned a stake in Atlas Air, but the shares were bought out by the new ownership group. Amazon also dry leases two 767-300s from Titan Aviation that are operated by ATSG carriers.\nAmazon\u2019s other providers of outsourced air cargo service in the United States are Sun Country Airlines, which operates 737-800s, and Hawaiian Airlines, with two Airbus A330-300 converted freighters.\nSteen declined to provide specifics about the breakup with Amazon over the dedicated transportation agreements, which give Amazon the option to terminate with 180 days of written notice for circumstances such as a change of ownership or performance issues. Penalty clauses can apply to either party for early termination but are likely subject to negotiation. Atlas Air was taken private in early 2023 by a consortium of investors led by Apollo Global Management.\nAmazon media representatives didn\u2019t respond to inquiries about changes to the company\u2019s air network. One analyst familiar with airlines that provide outsourced airlift for express delivery companies, who requested anonymity so as not to jeopardize business relationships, expressed skepticism that Atlas would voluntarily give up domestic flying to concentrate on widebody operations while acknowledging new ownership could value the return on investment differently.\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\u00a0\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\nYunExpress charters Atlas Air freighters for US e-commerce service\nThe post Atlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

The total value of his holdings rose from about $95 million to about $103 million.\nEleven holdings survived the period, and the Scion Asset Management boss added to all of them. For example, he boosted his stake in Alibaba from 75,000 shares to 125,000, his JD.com bet from 200,000 to 360,000, and his Star Bulk Carriers wager from 250,000 to 400,000.\nBurry also added five new holdings to his collection: Baidu, BP, First Solar, Sprott Physical Gold Trust, and Cigna. He also disposed of a bunch of stocks including Amazon, Alphabet, MGM Resorts, Toast, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\nThe Scion chief is best known for his monster wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\nHe also drew attention for investing in GameStop more than a year before it became a meme stock in early 2021. The frenzy around the video games retailer reignited this week after one of its biggest proponents, investor Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, returned to social media after a yearslong hiatus.\nBurry's latest portfolio update didn't feature any put options. The investor has previously held the bearish options on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes, Apple stock, a microchip ETF containing Nvidia, Elon Musk's Tesla, and Cathie Wood's flagship Ark fund.\nThe value investor is well known for his grave warnings and grim predictions about market crashes and economic catastrophes. For instance, he sounded the alarm on the \"greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things\" in the summer of 2021, and cautioned that buyers of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies would be caught in the \"mother of all crashes.\"\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

AMZN, Apple Inc.

The blue-chip index gained for seven consecutive days, marking its longest winning streak this year.\nWhile 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, we have highlighted five of them that have been leading the way higher. These are Amgen, Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Boeing and The Goldman Sachs Group.\nThe outperformance came as the market\u2019s rally broadened out. If this trend lasts, the Dow could continue its upward trajectory this summer.\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is finally paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\nThe blue-chip index also benefited from Apple\u2019s robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The iPhone manufacturer spread strong optimism after lifting its dividend payments and announcing a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales.\nAnother big mover in the index is Amgen, which surged more than 14% last week on a solid earnings report and encouraging test results of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. Bank stocks and small-cap stocks also showed an upward trend in recent sessions, powering the blue-chip index.\nFurther, the index appears unaffected compared with the other two major indices, which cooled down somewhat in the recent sessions following the latest Fed official comments that higher rates will likely stay for some time.\nAmgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience markets.

Emerging markets are countries that are transitioning from the \u201cdeveloping\u201d phase to the \u201cdeveloped\u201d phase.\nEmerging markets have been serial underperformers for nearly a decade. However, one important lesson I have learned is that when investors lose interest in a market area, that is precisely the moment in which the market turns. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, the most heavily-traded emerging market ETF in the U.S., is up a robust 9.2% over the past month, far outpacing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 0.21% gain.\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Jumia is a leading e-commerce platform in Africa. JMIA can be thought of as the \u201cAmazon\u201d of Africa because it offers a plethora of products for sale, including electronics, beauty products, and more. The company also offers services beyond e-commerce such as a DoorDASH\u2013 like food delivery service and a Booking\u2013 like travel booking services. Jmia is also expanding into payment processing, logistics, and data analytics.\nAccording to the World Bank, Africa\u2019s GDP will grow to 3.4% in 2024 and continue to grow into 2025. Outside of Asia, Africa will continue to be the fastest-growing area globally. Furthermore, Africa is behind Western Nations and most of the developed world regarding e-commerce adoption and many of the services JMIA offers. Because JMIA is the dominant e-commerce player in this largely untapped region, the company will benefit as Africa\u2019s economies modernize and more people move online.\nJMIA exploded 18% on massive volume after earnings were released earlier this month. Now, shares are emerging from a tight bull flag pattern that could quickly send them to the recent high of $8.\nInvestors are rotating into emerging markets after a long hiatus.

        "Text": "SenesTech, Inc. SNES, a player in the field of fertility control for managing animal pest populations, has announced the launch of its Evolve fertility control solution for rats on Amazon AMZN. This strategic move marks a significant advancement in the distribution of Evolve, the company's innovative minimum-risk soft bait designed for proactive rat control.\nUnlike traditional methods that rely heavily on poisons, Evolve targets the root cause of rodent overpopulation by reducing fertility rates.\nThis approach addresses the rapid reproduction of rodents, which can lead to severe infestations. The active ingredient in Evolve has been scientifically proven to reduce rodent fertility, making it a safer and more effective alternative to conventional poisons.\nThe launch on Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, significantly enhances the accessibility of Evolve to everyday consumers. The product was previously available primarily to professionals. Evolve's presence on Amazon allows a broader audience to adopt this effective pest control solution.\nThis move is expected to drive substantial growth in SenesTech\u2019s market share, leveraging the convenience and reach of e-commerce.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWith increasing regulations on the use of traditional rodenticides, particularly in states like California, consumers and pest managers are actively seeking safer and more sustainable alternatives. Evolve\u2019s availability on Amazon is well-timed, providing a viable solution that complies with stricter regulatory standards while maintaining efficacy in pest management.\nPer SenesTech, the U.S. rodent pest management market is valued at more than $1 billion annually, with a significant portion of sales occurring online. By tapping into this growing e-commerce segment, SenesTech is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for innovative pest control solutions. The strategic placement of Evolve on Amazon is expected to drive sustained growth for SenesTech.\nYear to date, shares of SNES have plunged 42.5% against the industry\u2019s 2.6% growth.\nSenestech currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hims & Hers Health HIMS and Medpace MEDP.

        "Author": "  David Nadelle ",
        "Text": "While prefabricated housing and home construction kits have long been popular options for homeowners who want to save money on sale prices and a variety of home-related expenses, leave it to Amazon to up the prefab game and make it even easier to get affordable housing delivered to you in a few days.\nCheck Out: In Less Than a Decade, You Won\u2019t Be Able To Afford Homes in These ZIP Codes\nRead Next: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nAmazon is selling portable prefabricated tiny homes by manufacturers like Chery Industrial, Doinuo and Zolyndo. The latter offers three home options: a $19,999 13-by-20 foot structure, a $22,999 15\u2032 x 20\u2032 house and its largest foldable house, which is a 380-square-foot home with a sale price of $34,999, according to The New York Post.\nAs The Motley Fool reported, the median home sales price for the first quarter of 2024 was $420,800, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis \u2014 down $2,400 from the previous quarter and $8,200 lower year-over-year. Compared to $35,000 for a top-end folding prefab, that\u2019s quite a disparity.\nLearn More: 7 Ways People Destroy the Value of Their Homes, According to a Real Estate Agent\nSponsored: Owe the IRS $10K or more? Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.\nOf course, there are a lot of additional costs associated with owning a \u201ctraditional\u201d home. Likewise, you\u2019ll need to figure out the costs that come with owning a mobile home that comes delivered on a pallet and takes less than a half-hour to assemble.\nAlthough shipping through Amazon will be free, a new foldable homeowner will need to factor in costs like land on which to settle (or to store or rent in a mobile home community), water and electricity hook-ups and insurance, plus any inspections or municipal approvals required. If you want to splurge on solar panels or extra insulation or reinforcement, you\u2019ll have to add those costs, too. Some public commenters criticized the likelihood of an insurer taking on the building, as well as the pitfalls surrounding wiring, heating, and plumbing.\nStill, you would need to pay most of these expenses if you bought an established or new-build house anyway \u2014 and would be paying much more for utilities in a bigger space. Considering the average sale price of a new manufactured (mobile) home in the U.S. is much lower than a conventional house ($122,200 in Dec. 2022, per Statista), buying a tiny foldable house on Amazon for a top price of $35,000 plus ancillary costs could provide you with a financially accessible path to homeownership, free you from being tied to a long-term mortgage. This could easily save you $100,000-$350,000, depending on your location and home prices in your area.\nIf you want to see a typical fold-out mobile house, check out Tiktoker Jeffrey Bryant\u2019s 19\u2032 x 20\u2032 house unboxing video. The unit comes complete with a living room area, kitchen, full bathroom and hookups for plumbing and electric. Taking only 20 minutes to unfold, Bryant plans on getting the unit ready to list on Airbnb. The house tour video garnered 8.5 million views in two days and now has nearly 20 million plays.\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Save a Minimum of $100,000 on This Housing Alternative: Amazon\u2019s Foldable Homes\n"

        "Text": "Dublin, May 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"India Ecommerce Market Opportunities Databook - 100+ KPIs on Ecommerce Verticals (Shopping, Travel, Food Service, Media & Entertainment, Technology), Market Share by Key Players, Sales Channel Analysis, Payment Instrument, Consumer Demographics - Q1 2024 Update\" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.E-commerce market in India is expected to grow by 9.65% on annual basis to reach US$117.6 billion in 2024. Medium to long term growth story of E-commerce industry in India promises to be attractive . The E-commerce is expected to grow steadily over the forecast period, recording a CAGR of 8.08% during 2024-2028. The E-commerce Gross Merchandise Value in the country will increase from US$107.3 billion in 2023 to reach US$160.5 billion by 2028.\nThis report provides a detailed data centric analysis of E-commerce market dynamics, covering over 100 KPIs in India. It details market opportunity across key B2C verticals - Retail Shopping, Travel & Hospitality, Online Food Service, Media and Entertainment, Healthcare and Wellness, and Technology Products and Services. It provides market share by key players across key verticals along with sales channels (Platform to Consumer, Direct to Consumer, Consumer to Consumer).\nIn addition, it provides spending pattern by payment instruments along with a snapshot of consumer behaviour in India. The report also covers niche trends such as market size by live streaming engagement model and cross border purchases. It also covers ecommerce spend share by operating systems, device (mobile vs desktop) and cities.\nThe B2C e-commerce market is expected to report strong growth in India over the medium term. An increasingly digital consumer base is driving the trend of online shopping in the Indian market. New-age startups, with the use of technology, are seeking to penetrate the rural markets to aid sales and revenue growth. This is driving the competitive landscape in the sector.Amid the surge in online shopping, both existing firms and new-age startups are raising capital rounds. The trend is projected to gain further momentum in the Indian e-commerce market in 2024. Food and grocery delivery platforms, on the other hand, are eyeing profitability over the medium term. Overall, the publisher maintains a positive growth outlook for the B2C e-commerce market in India over the next three to four years.E-commerce platforms are seeking to raise capital for accelerating growth in the Indian marketThe surge in online shopping is projected to continue over the medium term, with millions of new shoppers entering the market. This will drive industry growth over the next three to four years, and as a result, firms are seeking to raise capital to drive sales and revenue growth.\nFlipkart, for instance, is in talks to raise US$1 billion in a new funding round to accelerate growth. Walmart, which is the biggest shareholder in Flipkart, has committed to invest US$600 million in the Indian e-commerce giant. Flipkart has been rapidly expanding its presence in smaller towns and cities in India, unlike Amazon. With digital shoppers growing at a rapid rate outside Tier I and II cities, the publisher expects Flipkart to further increase its investment in Tier III and IV cities of India over the medium term.\nBuyEazzy, a beauty-focused e-commerce startup in India, also announced that the firm had raised US$4.25 million in a funding round in January 2024. The Series A round was led by Info Edge Ventures and included participation from M Venture Partners, and Incubate Fund Asia. The startup is planning to use the fresh capital for expansion and product enhancement. Over the next 15 months, the firm is planning to build a presence in 40 cities and onboard two million users.\nGoing forward, the publisher expects more such existing firms and startups to raise funding rounds from venture capital and private equity firms. This will support the market growth over the next three to four years in India.Food and grocery delivery platforms are eyeing profitability in the Indian market over the medium termAlthough more and more consumers are transacting on food and grocery delivery platforms, profitability has remained a concern among investors in the sector. These platforms, however, are now targeting profitability in the Indian market over the medium term.\nBigBasket, one of the leading players in the segment, is seeking to turn profitable in H2 2024. According to the firm, the slotted delivery business is already profitable. The BB Daily vertical is also close to profitability. The quick commerce vertical BB Now, however, is some distance away from profitability. The firm has introduced private-label products to drive gross margins. However, as the instant grocery delivery business is essential to the low order value, it is difficult to scale. Going forward, the firm is also considering building an offline presence significantly, enabling the firm to drive higher revenue over the long term.\nSwiggy, one of the leading food delivery platforms in India, is also eyeing to trim losses ahead of its initial public offering. The firm, for instance, has begun testing new platform fees for some of its users in Bengaluru. Swiggy, in H1 2024, might double the platform fee from INR 5 to INR 10. With these platforms delivering 1.5 to 2 million orders every day, any hike in platform fees can result in significant revenue growth over the medium term, thus trimming losses. Swiggy, notably, isn't the only firm to adopt a platform fee hike strategy. Zomato, in 2023, hiked the platform fee after Swiggy introduced an INR 2 platform fee.\nWith India being a price-sensitive market, a significant surge in platform fees can result in lower order volume for these food delivery platforms in the long term. Going forward, the publisher expects more firms to adopt strategic measures to trim losses while targeting higher profitability in their respective sectors.\nScope\nIndia Ecommerce Market Size and Future Growth Dynamics\nIndia User Statistics and Ratios of Key Performance Indicators\nMarket Size and Forecast by Ecommerce Segments (Gross Merchandise Value Trend Analysis\nMarket Size and Forecast by Retail Shopping Sales Channel\nMarket Share by Travel and Hospitality Sales Channel\nMarket Size and Forecast by Online Food Service Sales Channel\nMarket Size and Forecast by Engagement Model (Gross Merchandise Value Trend Analysis, 2019-2028)\nMarket Size and Forecast by Location (Gross Merchandise Value Trend Analysis\nMarket Size and Forecast by Device (Gross Merchandise Value Trend Analysis\nMarket Size and Forecast by Operating System\nMarket Size and Forecast by City\nMarket Size and Forecast by Payment Instrument (Gross Merchandise Value Trend Analysis, 2019-2028)\nConsumer Demographics\nIndia Ecommerce Market Share\nRetailKey Players\nAmazon\nColes\nKmart\nMyer\nWoolworths\nTravel Key Players\nExpedia\nLux Group\nShebah\nUber Taxi\nWebjet\nFood Service Key Players\nDeliveroo\nDoordash\nMenulog\nOpenTable\nUber Eats\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/a8e80s\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.
